> I don't understand why some people are against Urdu. It is Indian language, though not as old as Sanskrit, Tamil or Hindi but still it originated in India.


It is a common question. So, let me tell you why is the problem and ignorance towards Urdu. 

In mid 19th century, Mughal Empire ended and all of its bureaucracy, employees started Urdu movement. In that, they wanted Urdu as official language. Then Sir Syed Ahmed Khan and others turned Urdu into a religious identity of Muslims. All muslim organisations supported it. Simultaneously, Hindi movement was going on. Urdu supporters called Urdu as sophisticated language and Hindi the vulgar form. Then came Muslim League in picture which again pushed for Urdu identity of Muslims. In 2 nation theory, the language difference was emphasised. The use of Urdu by muslims was shown as symbol of different muslim nation. Obviously, it created a wedge in society.

When country was divided, same Urdu was forced on Bengalis as “sophisticated language” and Bengali as vulgar language. Result was 1971- Bangladesh. Urdu = Urdu imperialism in Pakistan. Not even 5% of Pakistanis could read & write Urdu at 1947. Yet, Urdu was made national language and far enriched and language of majority- Punjabi was avoided like some rural dialect. Use of Urdu means capturing of power by Urdu learned minority. Sindhi, Balochi, Pakhtuns all felt this in subsequent years. 

So, Urdu as a language is cool to use. But, thanks to all these Muslim scholars, muslim identity movements, power politics, Hindus are alienated by Urdu. Fault of Hindus in it? Not much.

Also, poet Allama Iqbal (great btw) made sure that identity politics survives. His poems are full of hate against idolatry. In a country with such diversity and Hindu majority, he made sure that few Hindus could be attracted towards Urdu poetry.
