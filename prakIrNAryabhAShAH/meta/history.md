> The Dravidian language Tamil retains a large number of old loans from
Maharashtri Prakrit, even though its descendent language Marathi does
not. This suggests that the prakritic base of other IA languages were
overlayed by a secondary layer derived from a later degeneration of
Sanskrit. This secondary layer is actually a Pan-Indian phenomenon and
could represent the point of normalization of the Pan-Indian Sanskritic
elite with respect to the Prakritic masses.
