Hemacandra (10th century) in Siddha-Hema-Śabdanuśāsana, defines Prakrit’s “nature” to be Sanskrit:

> “prakṛtiḥ saṃskṛtam, tatrabhavaṃ tata āgataṃ vā prākṛtaṃ”
> [Sanskrit is the prakṛti and Prakrit is called thus because it originates from Sanskrit]

Another prākṛt grammarian, Mārkaṇḍeya, writes in his grammar Prākṛtasarvasva:

> “prakṛtiḥ saṃskṛtaṃ, tatrabhavaṃ prākṛtam ucyate“
> [Sanskrit is called the prakṛti, and from there Prakrit originates].

Dhanika, in his ‘Daśarūpakāvaloka’ commentary on Daśarūpaka (one of the most important treatises explaining the 10 types of Indian Drama), says:

> “prakṛter āgataṃ prākṛtam, prakṛtiḥ saṃskṛtam”
> [from the prakṛti comes Prakrit, and that prakṛti is Sanskrit]

Siṃhadevagaṇin while commenting on Vāgbhaṭālaṅkāra writes:

> “prakṛteḥ saṃskrtād āgataṃ prākṛtam”
> [from Sanskrit (which is the Prakṛti) - comes Prakrit]

The Prākṛtacandrikā (a grammar of Prākṛt) says:

> “prakṛtiḥ saṃskṛtaṃ, tatrabhavatvāt prākṛtaṃ smṛtam”
> [Sanskrit is the prakṛti, it is remembered that Prakrit originates from that (prakṛti)]

The Prākṛtaśabdapradīpikā of Narasiṃha says:

> “prakṛteḥ saṃskṛtāyāstu vikṛtiḥ prākṛtī matā”
> [Alterations/changes (vikṛti) of the original Sanskrit - is known as Prakrit]

The Ṣaḍbhāṣācandrikā of Lakṣmīdhara repeats the same statement as the above:

> “prakṛteḥ saṃskṛtāyāstu vikṛtiḥ prākṛtī matā”
> [Alterations/changes (vikṛti) of the original Sanskrit is known as Prākṛt]

Vāsudeva, in his Prākṛtasaṃjīvanī commentary on Rājaśekhara’s Karpūramañjarī says:

> “prākṛtasya tu sarvameva saṃskṛtaṃ yoniḥ”
> [Sanskrit is the mother of all Prākṛt]

Nārāyaṇa, in his Rasika-sarvasva commentary on the Gītāgovindam of Jayadeva, says:

> “saṃskṛtāt prākṛtam iṣṭaṃ tato ‘pabhraṃśabhāṣaṇam”
> [From Sanskrit is derived proper prākṛt, and from that is derived the corrupt-speech i.e. apabhraṃśa]

Śaṅkara, in his Rasacandrikā commentary on the Abhijñānaśākuntala play states (Ref. provided by Dr. Surendramohan Mishra):

> “saṃskṛtāt prākṛtam śreṣṭhaṃ tato ‘pabhraṃśabhāṣaṇam”
> [From Sanskrit is derived best prākṛt, and from that is derived apabhraṃśa]
