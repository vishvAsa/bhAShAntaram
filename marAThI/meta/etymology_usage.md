This colonial-era transcription "Marhatta" is rather interesting. 

## Etymology
Prakrit Marahaṭṭha- is the metathesized form of Maharaṭṭha- (<Skt. Mahārāṣṭra-). See the rules of Hemacandra in the images attached. It is this form which gave rise to Early NIA "Marhaṭṭha-/Marhāṭha-"

Hobson Jobson gives this.

The etymologies deriving Marāṭhā from Mahār (name of a scheduled caste), Mahā- + Rāṭhaur (a Rajput clan), and mārnā (killing) + haṭnā (to go away) are obviously incorrect.

The derivation from "Mahārathin" as a tribal designation is possible, but not very convincing.

In my opinion, Marāṭhā comes from Mahārāṣṭra and mahat- ("great") in Mahārāṣṭra originally refered to the vast, elevated Deccan Plateau (cf. Karnāṭaka, from Dravidian *kar- "strong, great, black" + nāṭu "country, kingdom").

This toponym was later lexically extended to include the Sahyadris/Western Ghats and the West Coast as well.

## Usage
We see this Prakrit variant Marahaṭṭha- used even in Sanskrit poetry:

> अर्थो गिरामपिहितः पिहितश्च कश्चित्  
सौभाग्यमेति मरहट्ठवधूकुचाभः।  
नान्ध्रीपयोधर इवातितरां प्रकाशो  
नो गुर्जरीस्तन इवातितरां निगूढः॥

> "The meaning of a poet's words achieves its charm when it is somewhat concealed and also somewhat exposed like the bosom of maiden from the Marahaṭṭha country (i.e. Mahārāṣṭra).  
Neither should the meaning be too exposed like the breasts of Āndhra women nor too concealed as the breasts of Gurjara (Gujarati) women."

## ला ली ले
The Jaina Muni Uddyotana-Sūri (8th c.) also uses the term when describing a market scene in Kuvalayamālā:

> दढमडहसामलङ्गे सहिरे अहिमाणकलहसीले य।  
"दिण्णिल्ले गहिल्ले" उल्लविरे तत्थ मरहट्ठे॥

> "... the Marahaṭṭha-s there, who were robust, short in stature, dark-complexioned, tolerant, proud and quarrelsome by nature, and shouting the words "diṇṇille" (given) and "gahille" (taken)."

Here the merchants are using the words "diṇṇilla-" and "gahilla-" in lieu of standard Prakrit "diṇṇa-" (Skt. dattá-) and "gahia-" (Ved. gṛbhītá-, Skt. gṛhītá-) and Uddyotana-Sūri is employing this -illa suffix to show a peculiarity of Maharashtrian speech.

This suffix is the precursor of -ला (-lā, masc.), -ली (-lī, fem.) and -लें (-leṃ, neu.) in modern Marathi.

In modern Marathi the equivalent would be दिलेले (dilele) and घेतलेले (ghetlele).

## Marhāṭhī
Jñāneśvar also calls the language "Marhāṭhī"

> आणि तोचि हा मी आतां। श्रीव्यासाचीं पढ़ें पाहतां पाहतां। आणिला श्रवणपथा। मर्‍हाठीया॥

> "And now, having read and observed Vyāsa’s words attentively, I brought that work of his [i.e. Gītā] to the ears of listeners in Marhāṭhī."

There is clearly a historical "rh" in the developement of the word Marāṭhā (< Marhāṭhaä< Marahaṭṭhaä < Maharaṭṭhaɣa< Mahārāṭṭhaga< Skt. Mahārāṣṭraka).

## British knowledge
But how would the British administrators know of this feature? Most East India Company clerks and civil servants weren't trained philologists or linguists. Is it due to the influence of the Persian variant مرہتّہ or مرهتّه (Marhattah), presumably a Mughal-era transcription of Old Hindi and Braj Marhaṭṭ(h)ā?

I suspect that this anomalous transcription likely follows the path Old Hindustani/Rajasthani/Punjabi > Farsi (the chancery language of the Mughal courts and Nawabs of Awadh) > English, but I suppose it's also possible for the Brits to have picked up this "rh"-pronunciation from 17th century Marathi (and Konkani) dialects when they acquired the islands of Bombay from the Portuguese (as part of Catherine of Braganza's dowry)?

I'd assume that the 17th-century vernacular would've been a bit closer to the language of Jñāneśvar, Eknāth, et al. than to modern Marathi, though I'm not sure if they retained the "र्‍ह" in मर्‍हाठा.

What word did the British stationed at Surat Factory in Gujarat use for the Marathas in their records during Shivaji's sack of Surat? 

## शशाङ्क-प्रत्युक्तिः
The 17th vernacular Marathi isn't close to J́ńānēśvara's Marathi. That's ~ 400 years in between. People in the 17th century needed translations for J́ńānēśvara's works……. Ēkanātha reconstructed & rewrote portions of J́ńā. (there's a folk story about this, J́ńā. appearing in his dream and asking him to purify his work) and that is why some portions of the text & manuscripts we have now sound anachronistic…

The British certainly did have knowledge of Marathi texts like J́ńā. et al, and sometimes liked to name languages based on their classical names, given marhāṭī/marhāṭā appears in J́ńā. many times…… 

Thomas Stephens in his preface to the Kristapurāṇa (17th century) calls the language marāṭhiye «He sarua marâtthiye bhâsena lihile âhe»…… It is quite possible that many variants of the name existed in the 17th-18th centuries and the British picked that variant which was in form closest to their so-called ‘classical’ version….. 

### ऱ्ह
rh ऱ्ह does not exist in Konkani, it is only used sometimes to approximate the uvular /ʁ/ of post 18th century Portuguese, for example ऱ्हामुश for ramos “branches”. Also like Marathi, Konkani writes Sanskrit ह्र as ऱ्ह so ऱ्हस्व instead of ह्रस्व but you won’t find ऱ्ह anywhere else in both Modern Standard Konkani and Marathi.
