If the "goal" of Prakrit grammarians was to artificially create a perfectly systematic/deterministic, one-to-one derivational mapping from Sanskrit to Prakrit rather than document real-world variation among the various spoken Prakrits, they did a terrible job.

Skt. bhávanti (1 form) corresponds to:

Pkt. honti/honte/hoire/hunti/hunte/hoanti/hoante/hoire/hoenti/hoente/hoeire/hointi/hointe/hoaïre (14 forms)

Skt. bhūyánte (1 form) corresponds to:

Pkt. hoīanti/hoīante/hoīaïre/hoīenti/hoīente/hoīeire/ hoīinti/hoīinte/hoīire/hoijjanti/hoijjante/hoijjaïre/hoijjire/hoijjenti/hoijjente/hoijjeare/hoijjinti/hoijjinte (18 forms)

Skt. bhaviṣyánti (1 form) corresponds to

Pkt. hohinti/hohinte/hohire/hossanti/hossante/hoihinti/hoihinte/hoihire/hoehinti/hoehinte/hoehire/hoissanti/hoissante/hoessanti/hoessante/hojjahinti/hojjahinte/hojjahire/hojjāhinti/hojjāhinte/hojjāhire/hojja/hojjā/hoejjahinti/hoejjahinte/hoejjahire/hoejjāhinti/hoejjāhinte/hoejjāhire/hoejja/hoejjā (31 forms)

The Prakrit grammarians clearly weren't "generating" Prakrit from Sanskrit in a computational sense.
These forms are largely derivable through permutations of various Prakrit grammar rules.
The grammarians were simply using Sanskrit as the most convenient meta-language for categorization.
