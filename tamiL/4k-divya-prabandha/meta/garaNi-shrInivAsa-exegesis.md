## The divyaprabandha exegesis
shrI garaNi shrInivAsa undertook a huge project to learn tamiL, and write down word-by-word meanings as well as detailed explanations and transliterations of the pAshurams in kannaDa. It was a huge manuscript, with beautiful handwriting. They are of great use for shrIvaiShNa-s in karNATaka, who have long struggled in their devotions due to very slight knowledge of classical tamiL with no knowledge of tamiL script.

After he left for vaikuNTha, his son, garaNi-rAdhAkRShNa recovered the sole copy of this precious work from his sister's house and sought interested shrIvaiShNava-s to preserve (or publish). To this end, he approached various individuals and organizations ranging from the parakAla-maTha to a chennai library - no one agreed. Eventually, he got the manuscripts scanned into pdf files, and started distributing them via CD-s and on the internet. Finally, shrI lakṣmī-tātācār of melukoTe showed interest and even suggested getting it typed and publishing it. The material was rapidly typed, but the publishing process was very slow. shrI lakṣmī-tātācār departed for vaikuNTha before the first volume was published, and his son shrI MA Alwar took up the publishing task.

shrI harIsh, son of kaDaba rangarAjan, somehow came upon the scanned manuscripts and started reading them aloud and saving them in audio files.
