Periyāzhvar’s Pillaithamil on Kaṇṇan : The birth of Kaṇṇan

13. Kaṇṇan, Kesavan, the lovely child,
    was born in Thirukkoṭṭiyur filled with beautiful palaces.
    When the cowherds sprinkled oil
    and turmeric powder mixed with fragrance
    on each other in front of Kaṇṇan’s house
    they made the front yards of the houses muddy.

14. When cowherds heard that the divine child was born,
    they ran, fell and shouted in joy.
    They searched for the baby and asked everyone,
    “Where is our dear one?” They beat the drums, sang, danced
    and joy spread everywhere in their village.

15. When the glorious child was born
    the cowherds entered with love into Yashoda’s house,
    saw him and praised him, saying,
    “See! Among all men there is no one equal to this child.
    He was born under the Thiruvoṇam star
    and will rule the world.”

16. The women of the cowherd village
    took the pots from the uṟi,
    rolled them in front of their houses and danced.
    The fragrant ghee, milk and yogurt spilled all over
    and they were crazy with joy
    and their thick soft hair became loose.

17. When the cowherds with pots,
    sharp mazhu weapons, staffs for grazing the cows
    and palm-leaf beds to lie on
    heard that the divine child was born,
    joined happily together
    and laughed with their jasmine-like teeth.
    They smeared oil on themselves
    and jumped into the water to bathe.

18. The cowherdess Yashoda massaged
    the baby’s hands and legs
    and gently poured fresh turmeric water on his body
    from the pot and bathed him.
    When she cleaned his lovely tongue, he opened his mouth
    and she saw all the seven worlds inside.

19. When the baby opened his mouth,
    the beautiful cowherd women saw the worlds inside,
    wondered and praised him, saying,
    “This is not a cowherd child.
    He is the supreme lord, This wonderful child is really the Māyan!”

20. The cowherds planted poles of victory
    in all directions on the twelfth day after the child was born
    and gave him a name of the god who lifted up the huge Govardhana mountain,
    and they carried him in their arms and rejoiced.

21. Yashoda said, “If I put him in the cradle,
    he will kick and tear the cloth.
    If I take him in my hands, he will hurt my waist.
    If I embrace him tightly, he will kick my stomach.
    I don’t have strength anymore to deal with him.
    I am tired, my friends!”

22. Vishṇuchithan, wearing a shining sacred thread,
    composed pāsurams that describe
    the birth of omnipresent Nārāyaṇan, Purushothaman
    of Thirukkoṭṭiyur, surrounded with flourishing paddy fields.
    If devotees recite these pāsurams all their sins will go away.

56. Even though you are surrounded by a shining wheel of light
    and you spread light everywhere,
    whatever you do, you cannot match the beauty of my son’s face.
    O lovely moon, come quickly.
    My clever son, the lord of the Venkaṭam hills is calling you.
    Don’t make him keep pointing at you and hurt his hands.
    O lovely moon, come running happily to play with him.

57. As I hold him on my waist,
    my son opens his flower-like eyes wide
    and calls you as he points to you with his sweet fingers.
    O bright moon, if you know what is good for you, don’t try to fool us.
    You aren’t someone who doesn’t know
    how precious a child is. Come and see him.

58. He calls you loudly with his prattling words
    that come from his beautiful nectar-filled mouth.
    You move and don’t stop even when the beautiful one,

    and you cannot hear if someone calls you?
    Tell me, O wonderful shining moon.

    and a conch in his strong hands
    wants to rest and yawns.

Toddling. -- Kaṇṇan as a toddler.

86. Like an elephant with chains on his feet dripping with ichor
    that walks slowly as his chain makes the noise “chalar, pilar,”
    and the golden bells hanging on both side of him ring
    won’t my child with the Sārnga bow
    walk as the bells of the kiṇgiṇis on his feet ring loudly?
    Won’t he toddle with his lovely feet?

87. Won't the sapphire-colored Kaṇṇan, the child of Vasudeva,
    ornamented with a chain made of shell on his waist

88. He, Rishikesa, the bright one, wears a chain that shines like lightning,
    his hair is decorated with an arasilai ornament

    with the bright golden karai ornament that shines like lightning.
    He looks beautiful. Won’t he toddle?

89. When the dark cloud-colored lord
    with Lakshmi on his chest laughs with the sound “gaṇa, gaṇa,”
    it sounds like sugarcane juice pouring through the hole of a pot.

    as he comes and kisses them with his sweet nectar-like mouth.
    Won’t he toddle on his enemies’ heads and conquer them?

90. As the little Kaṇṇan runs swiftly behind his elder brother
    Baladeva who is praised by the whole world,

91. He has on his right foot the sign of a conch
    and on his left foot the sign of a wheel
    and when he walks with his two feet,
    he makes the marks of the wheel and conch on the ground.
    He toddles and gives me a flood of the joy again and again.
    Won’t the dark ocean-colored one, the father of Kama, toddle?

92. He walks as the saliva from his red lotus mouth
    continually drips slowly like small cool drops of dew.
    The bells that decorate his dress ring “gaṇa gaṇa”
    like the bells tied on the neck of a strong bull.
    Won’t he with his Sarngam bow toddle on his soft feet?

93. When Vasudevan, the sapphire-colored lord
    came to the world in the form of a child,
    people had never seen such a marvelous child before.

    that decorates his waist sways like a white waterfall
    dropping on a black hill. Won’t he toddle?

94. Thrivikraman plays throwing mud on himself
    like a dark elephant calf
    playing in the sand and throwing white dirt on his body.
    Won’t he toddle on the cool soft flower-covered earth
    without hurting his small feet that are like freshly blooming lotuses
    as his body sweats with small drops of water? Won’t he toddle?

95. When Kesavan with beautiful eyes
    that shine on his moon-like face toddles,
    his chuṭṭi ornament glitters and swings
    like the shadow of the moon in rippling water.
    The small drops of saliva dripping from his mouth
    give boons to his devotees even more than the water
    of the Ganges that showers drops from its rolling waves.
    Won’t he toddle?

96. The famous poet Vishṇuchithan of the Veyar clan
    described how the dark-colored lord born in the cowherd tribe
    toddled giving joy to his mother and making his enemies tremble.
    If devotees recite these pāsurams of Vishṇuchithan
    they will get children who worship the feet
    of the dark jewel-like Māyan .

     as you kick me with your feet.

129. Since you were born, I have not seen
     the ghee, the boiled milk, thick yogurt and fragrant butter that I kept.

     Don’t get upset, I won’t punish you.
     Smiling with your pearl-like teeth,
     come and drink milk from my breast.

130. If their children cry and go to their mothers
     because you hit them while you played with them,
     their mothers get upset
     and they come and complain about you.

     and there is no one to save you from him.

     You are the best among men, O Kesava!
     All the cowherd women have come here to see
     the ceremony of having your ears pierced
     and I have prepared betel leaves and nuts to give them.

140. O Nārāyaṇā, you are never away from the hearts of devotees

141. I bought and kept for you emerald earrings,
     shaped like fish that live in the ocean,
     so expensive that even the whole earth
     would be not enough to buy them.
     I will put threads through your ears without hurting you.
     I will give you all the things that you want.
     O radiant one, born in the cowherd clan to save the cowherds,
     you attract the minds of the young cowherd women by your magic.
     O Madhava, come.

142. O Govinda, the cowherd children wear earrings
     studded with beautiful diamonds
     that hang down from their ears—
     see, they are good children.
     O Govinda, why don’t you listen to me?
     If you wear these lovely earrings
     I will give you sweet jackfruit to eat
     and the milk from my beautiful breasts.
     Listen to me, my dear one. I plead with you—come here.

143. O dear child, even when I beg you
     and say I worship you, you don’t listen to me.
     How can I think you are a good child
     when you join the curly-haired girls,
     dance the kuravai dance with them and come back late?
     O dear child, if you will let me put the thread in your ears
     I will give you large appams even though you are naughty.
     You are the lord of the sky,
     your hair is as dark as a cloud
     and the girls with round arms like bamboo love you. Come here.

144. You cried so loud
     that even the sky-dwellers could hear you.
     When I looked into your mouth,
     I saw the whole earth inside and I was frightened
     as I thought that you are the Madhusudanan.
     See, even your ears know that there will not be any wound.
     Just bear with me, my dear child!
     You, our protector, are lovely like a dark cloud
     and have the color of the ocean.
     Come and drink the milk from my breasts.

145. You said, “I don’t want your milk”
     and ran away with the earrings.
     When the rain of stones fell,
     you carried Govardhana mountain happily
     and protected the herd of cows.
     O Thirivikrama, you broke the bow of Shiva
     and you are the chief of the beautiful cowherd village.
     I didn’t put the thread on your ears
     when you were a baby because I was worried
     your head wouldn’t stay still.
     Wasn’t that my mistake?

146 O dear child! you complained and said,
“See, mother, you shouldn’t say it is my fault.
When I ate mud, you caught me and hit me.
Didn’t you show your friends my mouth
and tell them I had eaten mud?”
O dear one, aren’t you Vāmanan
with an eagle, the enemy of the evil snake, on your flag?
If I do not put threads in, the holes on your ears will close.
O beloved lord who remove the troubles of your devotees,
I’m telling you the truth, I won’t hurt you.
Come and let me put in the thread.

147. O Sridhara, you complain saying,
     “Mother, you believed what others said and punished me.
     Isn’t it true you thought I had stolen the butter?
     And didn’t you pull me and tie me to the mortar?
     Everyone saw me tied to the mortar and made fun of me.”
     O, dear child, listen.
     If you keep complaining about what happened,
     laughing and wasting time, the holes in your ears will close.
     Come, I will put the thread in your ears
     before the beautiful women standing here laugh at you.

148. O dear child, you said,
     “Mother, what would it matter to you and these lovely women
     if my ears swell up and hurt?”
     I didn’t put the thread in your ears when you were young
     because I was worried it might hurt you. It is my fault.
     Don’t you see how all the children
     wandering around the cowherd village
     have had threads put in their ears?
     O Rishikesha, you killed Arishṭasuran and Vasthasuran
     by throwing a young calf at them.

149. You, a lovely child,
     stay sweetly in the thoughts of the beautiful girls
     with hair decorated with fragrant flowers
     who always look at you with love.
     You are our sweet nectar.
     I will give you fruits to eat.
     I will put the thread in your ears without hurting you,
     O Padmanabha, who kicked Sakaṭāsuran
     when he came as a cart and killed him. Come here.

150. O dear child, you told me,
     “If you pull my hand and say, ‘Come!’
     and put the thread in my ears, will it hurt you?
     My ears will hurt. I won’t let you do that.”
     O Damodara, you are the best among men.
     See these berries I brought for you.
     You killed the vicious Putanā by drinking milk from her breasts
     and destroyed Sakaṭāsuran when he came in the form of a cart.
     Come here.

151. The lovely Yashoda, wishing to put a thread in Kaṇṇan’s ears,
     brought emerald earrings and called her child.

152. I won’t allow you to go to rest in the bed
     with your dirty body that smells with the butter you stole
     and the mud you’ve been playing in.
     I’ve been waiting for a long time
     with oil and lemon juice to give you a bath.
     O dear lord, you are hard for anyone to reach.
     O Naraṇa, come to bathe.

153. Look, you, our beloved, want to catch small ants
     and put them in the ears of calves,
     but if you scare them and they run away
     how can you get butter from cow’s milk
     and eat it as you do now?
     O lord, You made the mara trees fall.
     Today is Thiruvoṇam, your birthday.
     Don’t run away. Come to bathe.

154. All the cowherd women called me
     and told me not to feed you milk
     because you drank the poisonous milk
     from the breasts of the devil Putanā,
     but my mind won’t let me not feed you, so I will.
     I’ve boiled water with gooseberry and filled a large pot with it.
     You have the color of a sapphire and are praised by all—

     made of brown sugar and milk for you.
     O dear child, come here if you want to eat them.

     will talk about you behind your back and laugh.
     You should have a good bath. O beloved lord, come here.

157. You roll the pots and spill the ghee from them.
     You pinch sleeping babies and wake them up
     and you open your eyes wide and scare them by making faces.
     O beloved lord , I will give you fruits to eat.
     O beautiful one with the lovely color
     of the sounding ocean that has roaring waves,
     come to bathe in the fragrant turmeric water.

158. From the time you were born,
     I have not seen the good milk that I have gotten,
     the churned yogurt and the butter that I put on the uri.
     O beloved child,
     I’ll be careful not to speak of these things in front of others
     because they may gossip," I’m your stepmother and am treating you badly."
     Come and bathe in the fragrant turmeric water.

159. You tied palm leaves to the tails of calves,
     and you shook fruits from the trees
     and threw them at the Asuran and killed him.
     You caught the tail of the snake Kalingan and danced on his heads.
     O best among men! I am not as strong as you are.
     Today is your auspicious birthday.
     You should take a good bath, O Nāraṇa.
     Don’t run away, come here.

160. I may be happy
     to see your golden body smeared with dirt
     because you went into the shed where the cows are tied,
     played with them and made yourself dirty,
     but others will blame me when they see you.
     You are shameless!
     If Nappinnai sees you, she will laugh.
     O my diamond, my jewel, come and bathe in the fragrant turmeric water.

161. Vishṇuchithan the chief of old Puduvai, praised by all the worlds,
     composed pāsurams describing how Yashoda

The complaining cowherd girls!

202. The cowherd girls complain saying,
     “When he gulps down the butter in our house
     and throws the pots on the stones
     we hear the noise of them breaking.
     We can’t stop his naughty deeds.
     You should take care of your son.
     The things he does hurt us
     as if someone were pouring sour juice into wounds.
     You should tell your son not to act like that.
     You gave birth to a son
     whose actions are very naughty.
     You are the mother of the chief of the whole world,
     O lovely Yashoda. Call your son!”

203. Yashoda talks to Kaṇṇan and her neighbors.
     “You are my dear child!
     As the dwarf Vamanan, you went to the king Mahābali.
     Come, come, come here!
     You are the best of the Kahusta dynasty,
     with dark hair, a beautiful face and a lovely mouth. Come here.
     And you, lovely neighbors, you know he is my beloved child,
     know how precious he is to me.
     Listen, son with a body dark as kohl,
     it hurts me when I hear the neighbors complain about you.
     I can’t bear it. Don’t you feel sorry for me? Come to me.”

204. The cowherd women complain to Yashoda and say,
     “Your wonderful son doesn’t hesitate to do naughty things.
     He thinks it is just fine to do them.
     He swallowed all the melted ghee in our pots and broke them
     and now he stands here as if he has done nothing wrong.
     Is it right to do bad things like this to your neighbors?
     Yashoda, call him to come to you.
     He doesn’t allow us to live!
     No doubt, he is indeed Madhusudanan.”

205. Yashoda asks Kaṇṇan to come to her and says,
     “O you with the dark color of a cloud, come,
     god of Srirangam, come, divine Naraṇan of Thirupperur
     surrounded by the ocean with clear waves, come.”
     He came running into the house and said,
     “I’ve only come to eat.”
     Yashoda could not get angry at him.
     She approached him and embraced him.
     This is the loving trick
     that Yashoda’s dear child has learned.

206. A cowherdess complains,
     “I milked the cow and put the milk on the stove,
     but I found out I didn’t have any fire to light it.
     I asked my daughter to stay there
     and went to borrow some fire from a neighbor.
     As I stood there and chatted with the neighbor for a while,
     the dear lord of Sāḷakkirāmam turned over the pot,
     drank the milk and ran away.
     O beautiful Yashoda
     with a voice as sweet as the juice from a sugarcane press,
     call your son.”

207. Yashoda calls Kaṇṇan to come to her.
     “ O my son, you should come to me.
     You should come to me now.
     Don’t say you won’t come. Come to me.
     The neighbors keep complaining about you
     and it’s hard for me to hear so many complaints.
     You are a happy little one!
     You carried Govardhana mountain
     and danced the Kuḍakkuthu dance.
     You are the meaning of the Vedas
     and my god of Venkaṭa hills. Come here.”

208. A cowherd girl complains,
     “I made twelve types of sweets with good rice,
     small lentils, sugar, fragrant ghee and milk
     for the festival of Thiruvoṇam.
     I know what he does—
     he already ate my food once before.
     He said he wanted more and gobbled everything up
     and stood as if he hadn’t done anything wrong.
     O lovely Yashoda, call your son
     and ask him to come to you.
     I only have a little bit of food left over.”

209. Yashoda calls Kaṇṇan to come to her.
     “O Kesava, come here.
     Don’t say no. Come to me.
     Don’t go to unfriendly people’s houses and play there.Come to me.
     Don’t stay where common people
     say bad things about you and servants live.
     Obeying your mother’s words is your duty.
     Damodara, come here.”

210. A cowherd girl complains,
     “ I kept sweet laḍḍus, seeḍais and sesame sweet balls in a pot and went outside.
     I thought no one would come into my house
     and take anything, but your son entered my house
     and ate all the sweets without leaving any at all.
     He even looked into the pot hanging on the uri
     and checked to see if there was any butter hidden there.
     O Yashoda, beautiful one, call your son to come to you.
     I’ve only told you some of the naughty things he did.”

211. A cowherd girl complains,
     “If anyone complains about your son, you get upset.
     O lovely Yashoda, he is tricky.
     He came to our house and called my girl,
     took her bracelets, went away through the backyard,
     sold them to the berry seller
     and bought some sweet berries and ate them.
     When I asked him about the bracelets,
     he said, “I haven’t seen them” and laughed.

212. The chief Paṭṭar, Vishṇuchithan, composed songs
     describing the play of the god of Srirangam in the southern land
     surrounded with groves where bees happily swarm
     and the Kaveri flows with its abundant water.
     If people sing these songs and dance
     they will become devotees of Govindan
     and will be like lights that brighten up all the eight directions.
     I bow to them and worship their feet.

The complaints of the young cowherd girls

213. O Yashoda, your son threw mud at us
     when we were bathing and playing in the river.
     He stole our bracelets and clothes
     and ran faster than the wind and hid in his house.
     When we asked for our clothes and bangles
     he didn’t answer. This isn’t fair.
     If he doesn’t give us our bangles it isn’t fair.

214. O Yashoda, your son who has long hair,
     long ear rings,
     and a sacred thread hanging down to his belly button
     is worshipped and praised by people in all eight directions.
     We are beautiful women and our hair is decorated
     with flowers that swarm with bees.
     Your son stole our clothes and climbed to the top of a tree
     that touches the sky and sat there. This isn’t fair.
     We begged him to give our clothes back, but he wouldn’t. This isn’t fair.

215. O Yashoda, your son stirred up the water in the pond
     where large lotuses bloom,
     grasped the tail of the poisonous snake Kalingan
     and climbed on its heads, dancing and shaking its whole body.
     We think that was good,
     but he stole our clothes, stays in the top of the tree
     and refuses to give them back. This isn’t fair.

216. O Yashoda, your son killed the Asuran Thenuhan,
     threw his body at the tree,
     and made the fruits of the palmyra tree fall.
     When Indra made a heavy rain fall on the cattle,
     he carried Govardhana mountain in his big arms
     and protected the cows. We think that was good,
     but he stole our clothes, stays in the top of the tree,
     and refuses to give them back. This isn’t fair.

217. O Yashoda, when your son stole the milk and yogurt
     in the cowherd village and ate them,
     the cowherds saw him, caught him and tied him up.
     Now he can’t steal the butter
     made by the cowherd women with round bamboo-like arms
     because they tied him up and spanked him so he cried. This isn’t fair.

218. O Yashoda, even when he was a baby
     toddling with his tiny feet,
     that young child knew in his mind
     that the devil Putanā would come, cheat him and try to kill him.
     When she came, he drank poisonous milk from her breasts and killed her.
     We think that was good,
     but he stole our clothes, stays in the top of the tree
     and refuses to give them back. This isn’t fair.

219. O Yashoda, he went to the sacrifice of king Mahābali,
     asked for three feet of land,
     and measured this earth with one foot
     and the sky with the other foot.
     We think that was wonderful,
     but he stole our clothes, stays in the top of the tree
     and refuses to give them back. This isn’t fair.

220. O Yashoda, your son, the god of gods in the sky,
     came riding on his vehicle, the Garuḍazhvar
     and removed the suffering of Gajendra the elephant
     when he was caught by a crocodile in the large pond
     blooming with cool screw pine plants and ambal flowers,
     killing the crocodile with his discus.
     We think that was wonderful,
     but he stole our clothes, stays in the top of the tree,
     and refuses to give them back. This isn’t fair.

221. O Yashoda, your son with the color of a cloud in the sky
     grazes the cows in the forest and plays happily.
     He took the form of a boar, went beneath the earth
     brought the earth stolen by an Asuran and put it back.
     We think that was wonderful,
     but he stole our clothes, stays in the top of the tree,
     and refuses to give them back. This isn’t fair.

222. Paṭṭan, the chief of Puduvai,
     composed pāsurams describing the complaints
     of the beautiful cowherd women to Yashoda
     about the lotus-eyed Kaṇṇan.
     If devotees recite these pāsurams
     they will have no troubles in their lives.
--------

Kaṇṇan, Yashoda and the cowherd women

223. He toddles and comes to me
     just like thousands of other children.
     I give him butter precious as gold and milk.
     He drinks the milk and embraces me.
     He, the king, drank milk
     from the breasts of the cheating devil Putanā
     with a waist as thin as lightning and killed her.
     Dear child, I know who you are
     and I’m afraid to give you food.

224. I gave a bath to your sky-blue body
     and fed you food sweet as nectar and went out.
     Before I came back you killed the Asuran
     when he came as a fully-laden cart
     and returned to stay quietly at home.
     You changed the mind of a young girl
     with a waist thin as lightning and made her love you.
     Dear child, I know who you are
     and I’m afraid to give you food.

225. You swallowed all the butter and the lentils in the pots
     and turned over the yogurt pot and ate all the yogurt.
     Now, after killing the Asurans disguised as marudam trees, you come.
     O best among men!
     You can do all these miraculous things.
     People say you are my son,
     but dear child, I know who you are
     and I’m afraid to give you food.

226. You fascinate the beautiful young cowherd girls
     whose dark eyes are decorated with kohl.
     You follow them holding onto their soft clothes
     and steal their clothes and stand away.
     You do many mischievous things.
     You tell lies and people are gossiping about you.
     I heard a lot about you near the pond.
     Dear child, I know who you are
     and I’m afraid to give you food.

227. You swallow the butter and the yogurt
     that the cowherd women churn three times a day and keep.
     You make the pots that the cowherds
     carry on their shoulders fall and drink the yogurt.
     You sob and sob like the children
     who want to drink milk from their mothers.
     Dear child, I know who you are
     and I’m afraid to give you food.

228. When an Asuran came as a calf
     and refused to eat the good paddy
     that all the other cows were eating happily
     on the flourishing fields humming with bees,
     you knew it was not a calf.
     You threw him up, made the vilam fruits fall and killed him.
     O naughty one, you wander about and plot
     to make a young girl whose soft curly hair is filled with bees
     fall in love with you.
     Dear child, I know who you are
     and I’m afraid to give you food.

229. You are light!
     You go into the grove and play soft music
     on your flute, enthralling everyone.
     The cowherd girls with soft curly hair come
     and surround you to listen to you playing music
     and worship you.
     O dear child, my only fault is that I have raised you.
     You are naughty and the cowherd women
     are always complaining about you,
     but I know who you are
     and I’m afraid to give you food.

230. Even if you keep quiet
     without doing anything naughty,
     people don’t believe it.
     You fascinate the beloved daughters of others,
     embrace and enjoy them,
     and do things one can’t speak of.
     No matter what I say about you,
     the cowherd families don’t listen.
     They blame me because of you
     until I can no longer listen to all their complaints.
     You, son of Nandan, are like a bull.
     I know who you are and I’m afraid to give you food.

231. Cowherd mothers go to sell buttermilk,
     cowherd fathers go behind the cows to graze them,
     and you, fearless, run behind the lovely village girls.
     You wander around and everyone who sees you
     says how naughty you are.
     You do things to please even those who don't like you.
     You are my dear child. I know who you are and I’m afraid to give you food.

232. You went into a blooming garden with a young girl
     with hair is adorned with a bunch of flowers,
     embraced her breasts adorned with pearl chains,
     and stayed there with her all night.
     You only returned after the night was gone
     and came at dawn.
     If people want to gossip about you
     I let them say what they want. I won’t shout at you.
     Dear child, I know who you are
     and I’m afraid to give you food.

233. Yashoda with fragrant flowers in her hair
     called the dark one colored like a cloud
     and told him that she will give him food sweet as nectar,
     not just any food.
     Paṭṭarpiran, the chief of Puduvai,
     the famous poet praised by the whole earth,
     composed pāsurams with Yashoda’s words.
     If people recite these pāsurams
     they will become the devotees of Rishikesa.

234. Yashoda says,
     “I bathed the dear kohl-colored child of the cowherd clan
     in turmeric water and sent him out to go behind the calves
     because I didn’t want him wandering from house to house.
     But how could I send my child who fought Kamsan
     without worrying that his ankleted feet would hurt
     as he went behind the calves?
     What a terrible thing I have done!”

235. Yashoda says, “I don’t want my son to go wandering around
     kicking and destroying the play houses
     of lovely doll-like girls
     with bodies adorned with fragrant turmeric powder.
     I don’t want him going around doing naughty things.
     Why have I sent him behind the calves to the forest
     where hunters go with their axes?
     Why did I send my child behind the calves?
     What a terrible thing I have done!”

236. Yashoda says,
     “I don’t want my son wandering
     and playing every day with young girls
     decorated with beautiful maṇimegalai ornaments.
     I don’t want him making his shining golden body dirty with mud.
     That’s why I’ve sent my sapphire-colored son
     to go behind calves on the forest paths
     where the bells of the cattle ring out.
     What a terrible thing I have done!”

237. Yashoda says,
     “I don’t want him wandering around
     in this cowherd village doing naughty things
     so the beautiful dark-haired women there come
     and gossip about him.
     He, the god beyond all thought is sweet to the eyes of all.
     I have sent him to the forest behind the calves to graze them.
     What a terrible thing I have done!”

238. Yashoda says,
     “I don’t want him wandering here and there
     in the cowherd village doing naughty things.
     I don't want him approaching the cowherd girls
     and kissing them with his lips that are like kovvai fruits.
     I’ve sent that divine one, the king of gods,
     behind the calves to the forest
     where hunters carry afflicting bows.
     What a terrible thing I have done!”

239. Yashoda says,
     “I don’t want him stealing butter,
     filling his mouth and swallowing it
     and doing many other naughty things
     as he wanders around in this cowherd village.
     I’ve sent him behind the calves to the forest paths
     where many elephants wander and people trip and stumble.
     What a terrible thing I have done!”

240.Yashoda says,
“I don’t want him jumping around,
playing and wandering about with his friends
as women with vine-like waists gossip about him.
I’ve sent the lord of Garuḍa behind the calves
to the hot forest paths where there are dry kaḷḷi plants.
What a terrible thing I have done!”

241. Yashoda says,
     “I carried him on my hip for twelve months
     and fed him nectar-like milk from my young breasts.
     Now I have sent my young lion-like son, behind the calves to the dry forest
     where he will hurt his golden feet.
     What a terrible thing I have done!”

242. Yashoda says,
     “I have sent my son Damodaran behind the calves
     without giving him an umbrella and sandals to go in the terrible forest
     where broken, hard, rough stones will hurt his feet.
     Cruelly, I have sent my son to the forest.
     What a terrible thing I have done!”

243. Paṭṭan, the chief of Puduvai
     filled with palaces that shine like gold
     composed a garland of sweet Tamil pāsurams
     that describe how Yashoda was worried
     when she sent her sweet sapphire-colored son to graze the calves.
     If devotees recite these pāsurams
     they will have no difficulties in their lives.

244. Yashoda says,
     “The young Kaṇṇan adorned with a kudambai flower
     for an earring on his one ear
     and a red thondri blossom on the other,
     with a lovely kachu around his waist, a checked dress on his body
     and a chest adorned with a precious pearl chain goes behind the cattle.
     Come and see the beautiful form of the ocean-colored lord.
     O lovely women, I am the only one
     with a precious son like him on this earth. There is no one like me.”

245. Yashoda says,
     “You are the eternal, famous Madhusudanan,
     and you stay in Srirangam surrounded with good strong walls
     where the Kaveri river flows and groves bloom.
     O Kesava, I have done wrong.
     I fed you a little food and heedlessly sent you
     on your tiny feet to graze the young calves
     because I thought it would be good for you.
     No woman has a harder heart than I.
     O small one, give me a kiss.”

246. Yashoda says,
     “O Damodara, you are the beloved of Nappinnai, lovely as a peacock.
     You go through the forest,
     graze the calves, run behind them and return,
     wearing koḍal flowers that bloom in the rainy season.
     Now see, your body is covered with dirt.
     I have made water ready for your bath.
     Take a bath and come to eat.
     Your father hasn’t eaten yet. He will eat with you.”

247. Yashoda says,
     “You stay in the beautiful Thiruvenkaṭam hills
     filled with fragrant groves!
     You are a strong bull that fights in terrible battles.
     O dear child, I brought you an umbrella, sandals and a flute
     but you went without taking them
     and your small red lotus feet
     that went behind the calves have blistered.
     Your eyes are red and you are tired, dear child!”

248. Yashoda says,
     “:You are a bull in battle!
     When you blow the Panchajanyam conch
     on the battlefield, your enemies shiver.
     You, are the little lion of the cowherd clan, the beloved of Sita.
     You are Thirumāl, small and short with lovely eyes.
     You left your clothes and a small sword on your bed
     and went to graze the cows with other cowherds
     and it seems now you have returned with them.”

249. Yashoda says,
     “O beautiful lord with a shining discus in your hand,
     I felt I might die when you entered the pond
     and fought with the snake that spat poison.
     What can I do?
     You made my stomach hurt.
     I am not worried.
     What you did made Kamsan happy.
     O lord, you have the dark color of a kāyām flower.”

250. Yashoda says,
     “You who, colored dark like the sea, rest on the milky ocean
     took the forms of a boar, a turtle and a fish.
     When the cunning Asuran came as a calf
     to the field where cows were grazing,
     you took him in your small hands
     and threw him at the vilam fruit trees.
     Those Asurans always do only evil things to my son.”

251. Yashoda says,
     “I just heard something that is new to me.
     It seems you ate the rice, curries and yogurt
     that the cowherds made and kept for Indra
     mixing them together.
     I’m not good enough to feed you.
     I’ll never be able to do it.
     O Vasudeva, your fame is faultless.
     From now on, I will be frightened of you.”

252. Yashoda says,
     “You carry a strong white conch in your hand.
     It is the auspicious Thiruvoṇam day, your birthday.
     I called some women whose words are like music,
     planted bean seeds and blessed you,
     praying that you may live for many years.
     I made curry and rice to celebrate your birthday.
     O dear child, don’t go tomorrow to graze the calves.
     Dress and decorate yourself and stay here.”

253. Vishṇuchithan, the chief of Puduvai
     where faultless people live
     composed ten pāsurams that describe
     how the cowherdess Yashoda
     saw her son coming after grazing the calves.
     If devotees learn these pāsurams and sing
     they will approach the ankleted feet of the ocean-dark lord.

254. Decorated with fresh leaves and garlands,
     cowherds come while the sounds of flutes and songs
     are heard everywhere while drums are beaten.
     Govindan, his hair adorned with peacock feathers,
     comes with them
     and young women, coming to their doorsteps,
     see the cowherds and Kaṇṇan and say,
     “Is a cloud coming in the crowd?”
     They forget what they should do
     and stand there, forgetting even to eat.

255. Kaṇṇan, wearing a soft garment
     that looks like the petals of flowers blooming on a vine,
     carrying a small sword,
     and adorned with a garland made of fragrant mullai
     and vengai blossoms mixed with fresh kachandi leaves
     comes in the middle of a group of cowherds in the evening.
     O girls, if you go before him, you will lose your beautiful bangles.

256. His young friends wearing silk garments
     run behind him carrying small swords, bows, chendus and sticks.
     One of them blows a conch so the cows will hear and return.
     Kaṇṇan, tired, comes with them.
     My daughter sees his beautiful body
     adorned with turmeric powder and approaches him.
     The people of the village see and gossip about her.

257. He, my beloved one, carried Govardhana mountain
     and protected the cows when there was a big storm.
     Now he plays music on his flute as a cowherd,
     grazes the calves and comes with his friends.
     O beautiful friend, I see him on the streets.
     I have not seen anyone like him before.
     O friend, come and see him.
     All my bangles are getting loose
     and my young breasts beneath their blouse are not in my control.

258. I saw the cowherds carrying umbrellas
     made of peacock feathers standing around Kaṇṇan
     wearing beautiful peacock feathers in his hair.
     They sang and danced in front of their doorsteps.
     I don’t want you to give me in marriage to anyone
     except Māyan, the lord of Thirumālirunjolai.
     You should realize that I belong only to the victorious one
     and give me in marriage to him.
     If you don’t, it will plunge into sorrow.

259. He will be wearing a shining sinduram
     and a perfect nāmam on his divine forehead.
     The lovely music of flutes and the sound of drums will play.
     With the cowherds carrying their grazing sticks
     he will come into the flourishing grove.
     He is a cowherd child, yet he is the eternal god
     and he will walk on the street as if he knows everything.
     Let’s stop him and tell him that he stole our ball
     and see the lovely smile on his coral mouth.

260. Kaṇṇan goes behind good cows in a flourishing grove
     with his divine body shining brightly,
     his fragrant hair decorated with peacock feathers.
     His beautiful lotus eyes shining,
     he comes among a group of cowherd children,
     plays the flute, sings songs and dances,
     as the cowherds come with him singing and dancing.
     My daughter is fascinated seeing the beauty of that cowherd child.

261. He is adorned with a poṭṭu made of red powder and
     a divine nāmam on his forehead.
     Wearing beautiful peacock feathers in his hair,
     the cowherd child comes like Indra, the king of the gods.
     I told my daughter, “If you go in front of him, you will lose your bangles.”
     My beautiful girl stands before him in the middle of the street,
     and see, her bangles and clothes are becoming loose.

262. On his left ear he wears a lovely thondri flower
     and his long hair is adorned with jasmine and forest mauval flowers.
     My daughter sees the beauty of the cowherd child
     as he comes playing his flute and she falls in love with him.
     She stands before him without moving
     and see, her lovely bangles become loose and she grows thin.

263. Vishṇuchittan, the chief of Puduvai
     surrounded with lovely groves where bees swarm,
     composed ten pāsurams about the love of the cowherd girls
     when they see Kaṇṇan, the god of the gods,
     coming on the street of the cowherd village
     surrounded by cows and children.
     If devotees sing these songs happily,
     they will reach divine Vaikuṇṭam.

Govardhana mountain

264. The victorious umbrella-like mountain
     that the dark ocean-colored lord
     who ate a pile of rice with lentils, yogurt and ghee
     carried to protect the cows
     is Govardhana where gypsy girls
     feed good milk to the round-eyed innocent fawns
     that were caught by their husbands and given to them.

265. The victorious umbrella-like mountain
     that Madhusudhanan carried to stop the rain
     when Indra, the king of gods was angry
     and made it rain for seven days,
     hurting the innocent cows,
     is Govardhana where a female elephant chased by a young lion,
     afraid her cub may be hurt and protecting it under her legs,
     opposes the lion and fights.

266. The victorious umbrella-like mountain that our father
     with a shining discus in his hand
     carried when the cows, the large-eyed cowherd women
     and the cowherds screamed and asked for help saying,
     “Help us, you are our refuge!"
     is Govardhana where men with strong mountain-like arms
     bend their bows when their lovely doll-like women
     ask them to catch deer, saying,
     “See, a group of deer are grazing on our millet.”

267. As Kannan picked up Govardhana mountain
     where the clouds gather
     after descending to the ocean,
     scooping up the water, rising to the sky in the east
     and pouring down rain,
     he was like a mahout giving a ball of rice
     to a cruel-eyed elephant.

268. The victorious umbrella-like mountain that our father,
     who once took the form of a boar, carried,
     digging it up and calling the gods, saying,
     “O gods in the sky!
     If anyone among you is strong enough, tell me,
     and come carry this with me!”
     is Govardhana where a happy forest elephant
     that has lost its tusks raises its trunk, worships
     and asks him to give the crescent moon for his tusk
     as the musth pours from his temples.

269. The victorious umbrella-like mountain
     that our wonderful Thirumāvalavan carried,
     putting all the five fingers of his lovely lotus hand
     at its base and lifting it with his large, beautiful arms
     is Govardhana where the water
     of the white waterfall flows everywhere
     as it carries lovely glistening beautiful pearls
     and makes the hill look like a treasure of pearl garlands.

270. The victorious umbrella-like mountain
     that our Damodaran carried
     using the five fingers of his wide hands
     just as the thousand-headed Adishesha carries the earth
     is Govardhana where the monkeys live
     and put their small children to sleep
     holding them in their hands
     and singing the fame of Hanuman
     who went to Lanka and destroyed its pride.

271. The victorious umbrella-like mountain
     that Narayaṇan carried to protect the cows
     when the strong rain fell
     like a warrior using his shield to stop
     the arrows coming at him like a heavy rain
     is Govardhana where pious rishis practice tapas
     living in huts roofed with leaves, while angry murderous tigers
     go and sleep with them.

272. The victorious large mountain that Damodaran carried
     who drank milk from the breasts of the terrible devil Putanā and killed her
     is Govardhana that has the same name as the god Govardhanan.
     There monkeys carrying their babies on their backs,
     climb on the branches of trees and teach them how to jump.

273. When the beautiful blue-colored one
     carried Govardhana mountain,
     the fingers of his lotus hands did not loose their beauty
     and his strong beautiful finger-nails did not hurt.
     He carried the mountain as if it were something he did every day.
     On victorious umbrella-like Govardhana mountain,
     a group of large clouds that rest on the top of the hills
     make the mountain look as if it has grey hair
     as they pour down rain everywhere.

274. The famous Paṭṭarpiran Vishṇuchithan
     where the Vediyars recite the divine Vedas
     composed these ten pāsurams on Govardhana mountain
     where jasmine flowers bloom on the branches of kuravam trees.
     He describes how the hill is carried as an umbrella
     by the god who rests on Adishesha
     and rides on an eagle, the enemy of snake.
     If devotees recite those pāsurams in their hearts
     and worship him, they will reach divine Vaikuṇṭam.

Kaṇṇan plays the flute

275. O beautiful girls of this wide world, hear a wonderful thing!
     When Thirumāl with a white valampuri conch in his hand
     plays the flute with his divine lips,
     the cowherd girls with young breasts
     hear the sound of the flute, are excited,
     shiver and run away from their houses
     where they are guarded,
     untying the ropes that they bind them
     and putting those ropes on their necks as if they are garlands.
     Shyly they come and surround him.

276. When Govindan takes his flute in his hands,
     bends his eyebrows, blows the air from his stomach and plays,
     young doe-eyed girls as beautiful as peacocks listen.
     Their hair decorated with flowers becomes undone,
     their dresses become loose
     and holding their falling dresses
     they stand looking at him out of corners of their eyes.

277. When the prince of the sky, the lord of Vaikuṇṭam,
     the little one of Vasudeva, the king of Madhura, Govindan,
     the princely son of Nandagopa
     the little child of the cowherds plays his flute,
     young Apsarases come down from the sky and approach him,
     their hearts melting and their flower-like eyes shedding tears.
     Their hair swarming with bees becomes loose, their foreheads sweat
     and they close their ears to everything else
     and hear only the music of his flute.

278. When the small dark-colored Kaṇṇan
     who fought, conquered and destroyed
     the evil Asuras Thenuhan, Pilamban and Kaliyan
     plays his flute wandering about in the forests,
     Menaga, Thilothama, Ramba,
     Urvasi and other heavenly Apsarases,
     fascinated as they hear his music, are speechless
     and come down from the sky, dancing and singing with joy.

279. Madhusudanan, feared by the kings of the three worlds,
     who came as a man-lion and killed Hiraṇyan
     When he plays the flute, Narada with his Tumburu veena,
     and players of the kinnaram, the midunam and other string instruments
     hear his music, forget their skills and say,
     “We won’t touch our musical instruments
     because we can’t compete
     with the lovely music of Madhusudanan.”

280. When our highest lord, a lion among the gods,
     who was born to Devaki as a child
     with large beautiful eyes and strong arms
     plays his flute,
     the Gandharvas wandering in the sky,
     fascinated by the nectar-like music,
     say, “He, the highest, is playing the flute,”
     and, feeling ashamed because they can’t play like him,
     they stand, join their hands and worship him.

281. Listen to the wonders that I have seen on this earth!
     When Kaṇṇan who has beautiful large eyes and strong arms
     plays his flute in the middle of a crowd of young cowherds,
     the music is heard in the world of the gods
     and all the sky dwellers forget to eat their sacrificial food
     and enter the cowherd village.
     Their ears are filled with the sweetness of the music
     and they follow happily wherever Govindan goes
     and do not leave him at all.

282. When Govindan plays the flute
     holding it in his small fingers,
     as his beautiful eyes close, his red cheeks puff out
     and his brow sweats with small drops of water,
     flocks of birds leave their nests,
     come and surround him.
     Herds of cattle leave the forest
     where they graze, come near Govindan,
     and lie down with their legs apart.
     They bend their heads, listening to the music of the flute
     and move their ears as if they are dancing.

283. His dark color is like mass of clouds,
     his face is beautiful like a red lotus,
     and his dark curly hair has the color of bees.
     When he plays his flute,
     a herd of deer, fascinated with his music, forgets to graze
     and grass that they have eaten hangs from their mouths
     and, not swaying from side to side,
     they stand motionless as if they were painted pictures.

284. When the matchless one,
     the chief of the cowherds
     adorned with dark-eyed peacock feathers and a silk garment
     tied tightly and beautifully on his handsome body,
     plays the flute,
     the trees stand without moving,
     flowers pour down honey-like drops as if to bow and worship him
     and straight branches bend to hear the music.
     They all turn towards wherever the beautiful Thirumāl is
     because that is their nature.

285. Vishṇuchithan the chief of Puduvai composed pāsurams
     about how music flowed like a flood of nectar
     from the holes of the bamboo flute
     in the beautiful hands of curly-haired Govindan
     with a tuft on his head.
     If those skilled in Tamil recite these pāsurams of Vishṇuchithan
     they will be among the devotees of the god.

The mother worries about her young daughter

286. She plays on the sand and makes herself dirty.
     She speaks like a baby.
     She doesn’t know how to wear her lovely dress made with fine thread.
     She has never gone out of our front yard with a small play pot in her hands,
     yet holding the hands of the one
     who rests on the snake Adisesha, she comes home.

287. Her teeth have not grown out yet,
     her hair is not yet thick,
     and she plays with sparse-haired still innocent children.
     But now she has made friends with naughty girls
     and says that they are good children like her.
     She has fallen in love with Māyan,
     the beautiful sapphire-colored lord.

288. Even when she tries to make a play house
     on the white sand in the front yard of her house,
     she cannot make it without drawing
     pictures of a conch, a wheel, a club, a sword and a bow.
     Her breasts have not grown out yet.
     My heart worries every day
     because she is in love with Govindan.

289. Who can I tell about the tricks
     that this young Kaṇṇan does?
     He gets together with my young, innocent daughter’s friends
     and cheats her and makes fun of her.
     She doesn’t know the old saying
     that the spoon that scoops the porridge
     doesn’t know how much salt is in the porridge.
     Just like that she does not know
     whether the lord with a discus in his hand loves her
     as much as she loves him.

290. She wears fragrant thulasi garlands
     and goes to all the cities and lands
     where Narayaṇan stays and searches for him.
     Many can’t understand her and want to hurt her.
     Confused, they say, “Put her in a guarded place with Kesavan.”
     Why is the world like this?

291. I decorated her with a forehead ornament,
     golden ear rings, a paḍagam ornament and anklets
     and raised her with love,
     but she doesn’t want to stay with me now.
     She left me and just keeps saying, “Puvai puvanna!”
     O girls with long thick hair, see, she is falling in love with him.

292. I am an innocent mother and she is my innocent daughter.
     She stands in front of the girls who obey their mothers
     but she is like a spoon that gets loose from its stem and spills food
     everywhere without knowing what it is doing.
     Shameless, she mutters like a parrot and says,
     “Kesava, you are faultless!”
     O girls with long fragrant hair,
     she is fascinated with him and has fallen in love.

293. She wears pretty clothes and looks at herself in the mirror.
     She makes the bangles on her arms jingle.
     She wears a new sari and sighs.
     She decorates her red mouth as sweet as a kovvai fruit.
     She does the same thing again and again.
     She raves about the power of him with a thousand names.
     She falls in love with the sapphire-colored lord
     who has no hatred for anyone.

294. What is the use if I save abundant wealth and wish to spend it
     to do auspicious ceremonies for her? It only hurts me.
     She is like a tender shoot that grows on a field
     and he is like the owner of that land.
     He can do whatever he wants with her.
     Take her to the place of the beautiful one
     colored like a dark cloud and leave her there.

295. We did all the auspicious ceremonies
     that we were supposed to do for her
     and kept her in our home thinking that she would stay there,
     but she wants to do something else
     and worries how she can leave home.
     Before others know that she is in love with him
     and is leaving home because her parents
     have not arranged marriage for her,
     we must take her to him
     who went to Mahābali as a dwarf
     and measured the world.

296. Vishṇuchithan, the chief of Puduvai
     surrounded with beautiful flower gardens
     composed a garland of ten pāsurams
     about how a mother describes her daughter's love
     for Narayaṇan who swallowed the whole earth
     and rests on a banyan leaf.
     If devotees recite these pāsurams
     they will have no trouble in their lives.

A Mother's worry

297. I haven’t seen my daughter anywhere.
     My house is empty.
     It is like a pond that has lost its beauty
     and its fresh lotuses have shed their petals
     when the dew has fallen on them
     and the alli blossoms have shed their pollen.
     Did she go towards Madurai city
     following him who destroyed the Asurans
     when they came disguised as wrestlers?

298. Nārāyaṇan made my virgin daughter play with him
     and took her with him like the ignorant cowherds who steal calves.
     Won’t this terrible thing that Narayaṇan did
     be a disgrace for our family?

299. We made arrangements for my daughter’s wedding,
     decorated her beautifully and kept her at home.
     We announced to our relatives
     that we are giving her in marriage to Dāmodaran.
     Will the people beat the sounding drums,
     worship the queen of Indra the king of gods
     and decorate this village with beautiful garlands?

300. I have only one daughter
     and I raised her like Lakshmi, the beautiful goddess.
     The world praises me as a good mother.
     Lovely-eyed Thirumāl has taken her with him.
     Will Yashoda, a woman of a respectable family
     and the mother of a wonderful son,
     feel happy seeing her daughter-in-law
     and perform the post-marriage ceremonies for her well? Will I see that?

301. Will Nandagopan, the father-in-law
     of my daughter, embrace her and say,
     “I am proud to have you as my daughter-in-law?”
     Seeing her lovely fish eyes, red mouth, round breasts,
     waist and beautiful arms,
     will he say, “How can the mother of one like you
     be able live apart from you?”

302. Will the family of her in-laws join together,
     perform all the requisite ceremonies
     and make her happy? Will her beloved
     who killed the Asuran that came as a cart
     be able to live happily with my daughter
     whom he married as the whole city
     and the country looked on?

303. Will the chief of the gods with a discus in the sky
     live with my daughter without blaming her for anything?
     Will he live with her in the family
     and give her the name of belonging to a cowherd family
     so that all the other housewives will know and protect her?

304. O beautiful girl!
     The son of Nandagopan doesn’t do any of the things
     that people born in good families do.
     He doesn’t follow our customs. O my god,
     my daughter’s waist is becoming thin
     and she is longing for a better life.
     Will her hands become rough
     always churning buttermilk and holding the churning rope?

305. Without sleeping well,
     can my daughter wake up before dawn and churn the white yogurt?
     Will he, with shining lotus eyes who measured the world,
     make her do hard work or will he keep her happy?

306. The chief of flourishing Puduvai
     composed ten pāsurams describing
     how a good mother went to a cowherd village
     searching for her daughter
     when she went away with Māyavan
     and how she worried whether her daughter
     could live as a daughter-in-law in the cowherd village.
     If devotees recite the pāsurams of Vishṇuchithan
     they will become devotees of the sapphire-colored lord.

307. O undi, fly and sing the strength of my lord. .
     He pulled a beautiful Parijatha flower tree
     from Indra’s world with the help of strong Garuḍa

     followed him crying, “My dear son!”
     Sing the praise of Rāma the beloved of Sita.

311. O undi, fly and sing the praise of the dark kohl-colored god

     of the snake Kālingan and gave it his grace.
     Sing the praise of the lion-like son of Yashoda and fly.

312. O undi, fly and sing the praise
     of Rāma who gave his padukas

     followed him and asked him to come back
     to rule all the three worlds and be the king and show him his grace.
     Sing the praise of the king of Ayodhya and fly.

313. O undi, fly and sing the praise

     Praise the pure sapphire-colored lord and fly.

314. O undi, fly and sing the praise of Rāma
     who gave the kingdom to his younger brother

     and in the forest he cut off the ears and nose
     of thin-waisted Surpanakha as she screamed.
     Sing and praise the king of Ayodhya and fly.

315. O undi, fly and sing the praise of him
     who kicked and destroyed the Asuran
     when he came in the form of a deceiving cart
     and killed the Asuran brothers

     The clever lord goes with the cowherds, protecting the cattle
     and playing the flute wonderfully.

the heroic deeds of Kahustan, the son of Nandan.
If devotees learn and sing these ten pāsurams of Vishṇuchittan
they will have no trouble in life.

Hanuman sees Sita.

318. Hanuman sees Sita in Asokavanam in Rāvaṇan's Lanka and says,
     “O Beautiful goddess with dark thick hair!
     I am your slave. This is my request.
     Rāma broke the bow of king Janakan
     whose shining crown was studded with diamonds and married you.
     When Balarāman, known for his excellent tapas,
     stopped him on the way to Ayodhya after your marriage,
     Rāma broke his bow and destroyed his powerful tapas.
     This tells you I am a messenger from Rāma.

319. “O you with hair adorned with lovely alli blossoms,
     I bow to your feet. This is my request.
     Show me your grace and listen,
     you who are beautiful as a doe
     and have two eyes like blooming flowers.
     One day when you were with your beloved husband,
     he brought you a jasmine garland
     and you were very happy to see it.
     This tells you I am a messenger from Rāma.

320. “Kaikeyi, the queen of Dasharatha,
     confused in her mind,
     asked for two boons from Dasharatha
     and the king with a sorrowful heart
     was unable to refuse and granted the boons.
     He sent Rāma away saying, ‘O dear son of our family!
     Go and stay in the forest!’
     and Rāma went with his brother Lakshmaṇa.
     This tells you I am a messenger from Rāma.

321. “O Vaidehi, beautiful one
     with breasts are encircled by a band,
     this is my request
     to you, the royal queen of the king of Ayodhya,
     who has a beautiful chariot.
     Give me your grace and hear me.
     He became a good friend of Guhan,
     who, skilled in using a sharp spear,
     lived on the bank of Ganges.
     This tells you I am a messenger from Rāma.

322. “O Vaidehi, as lovely as a doe,
     with words as sweet as milk,
     this is my request.
     When you and Rāma went to the forest
     filled with stony paths and stayed in Chithrakuḍam
     where the mountain slopes are covered with groves
     and flowers drip honey
     Bharatha came and worshiped you.
     This tells you I am a messenger from Rāma.

323. “When you were in Chithrakuḍam,
     a small crow came and touched your breast.
     You were scared when Rāma shot an arrow at the crow
     and the crow, frightened, flew all over the world.
     You called Rāma, saying,
     ‘O Rāma, clever one, come, you are my refuge.’
     At once Rāma came and made the crow blind in one eye.
     This tells you I am a messenger from Rāma.

324. “This is the request of your true slave
     to you whose waist is as thin as lightning. Hear me.
     When a golden deer came in the forest and played sweetly,
     you asked your beloved husband to bring it to you,
     and when he took his bow and went to catch it,
     he asked Lakshmaṇa to watch you.
     But Laksmaṇa left you without guarding you
     searching for Rāma because he heard Rāma calling him
     and thought he was in trouble. This tells you I am a messenger from Rāma.

325. “O Vaidehi, with hair dark as kohl
     decorated with beautiful flowers,
     this is request of me, the monkey chief.
     The king of Ayodhya told all these things to me
     so that I could search for you.
     Here is a ring from his hand—
     the best of all signs that I am his messenger.”

326. Sita saw the ring of Rāma, praised in all directions.
     She thought of the day when Rāma came to Janaka’s palace,
     broke the bow in the middle of a large assembly of kings
     and married her.
     Sita, decorated with flowers on her hair,
     said, “O Hanuman, this is a marvelous sign!”
     and joyfully put the ring on the top of her head.

327. The Paṭṭarpiran of Puduvai, praised by all the world,
     described in pāsurams the signs
     by which the famous Hanuman convinced Vaidehi
     when he saw her, the beautiful one
     whose breasts were tied with a band.
     If devotees recite these pāsurams
     they will stay with him in divine Vaikuṇṭam.

     whose strong arms were decorated with bracelets.

     and a divine shining discus in his right,

     Go to the people who saw him
     driving a chariot yoked to white horses
     and decorated with victorious monkey flags
     in the Bharatha war where he used his tricks to help Arjuna.

335. If you want to see the young son of Devaki,
     Kaṇṇan, the lord who hid the light of the sun with his discus
     for thirty nalihais, made enemy kings wait and conquered them,
     go to the people who saw him drive the chariot for Arjuna
     when Arjuna fought and killed Jayathratha in the Bharatha war.

336. If you are searching anxiously
     for our lord who swallowed the earth, the mountains,
     the wavy oceans and everything else and spat them out,
     go to the people who saw him
     when he became a boar that no one can imagine,
     dug up the ground and brought the earth from the underworld
     and married the earth goddess with lovely dark hair.

     Praising the Devotees of Thirumāl in Thirukkoṭṭiyur
     and blaming those who are not Vaishnavas

360. Thirukkoṭṭiyur is where devotees live CHECK
     who never say wrong things,
     feed guests every day, serve the god,
     and learn and recite the Vedas.
     Our ancient god, our creator
     is the three gods Nanmuhan, Shiva and Indra.
     How could he has created sinful people
     in Thirukoṭṭiyur who do not think of him?

361. In Thirukkoṭṭiyur the faultless devotees
     do only good deeds, do service to their gurus,
     never get angry and are generous.
     The sapphire colored lord has swallowed all the seven worlds.
     If the devotees do not worship him,
     could they have been born just to give terrible pain to their mothers?

362. Thirukoṭṭiyur is filled with porches
     studded with beautiful precious diamonds
     and emeralds and filled with cool shadow
     where the devotees count with their fingers the divine names
     of the auspicious god Thirumāvaḷavan.
     How can people live there
     not thinking of the god even for a moment,
     not counting the names of him with their fingers,
     and merely swallowing food with their dirty mouths.

363. Thirukoṭṭiyur is surrounded with fields
     filled with beautiful lotuses
     and flocks of white swans that are like the white conches
     in the hands of the lord resting on the soft snake bed.
     What sins would the water people there drink
     and the clothes they wear
     have to commit to make them fail to recite
     with their tongues his names
     that destroy hell for them?

364. In Thirukkoṭṭiyur young valai fish
     jump over the backs of turtles,
     knock over lovely flowers
     and play in the water mischievously.
     The hard-hearted ones living there
     without thinking of the lord
     with a discus in his strong hand
     should eat grass instead of rice.
     They are a burden to the earth.

365. Thirukoṭṭiyur is where devotees live praising Narasimhan,
     and performing the five sacrifices,
     never disturbed by water, sky, earth, wind or fire
     or the troubles that the five senses bring.
     The world is fortunate because dust falls on the earth
     from the feet of those generous devotees.

366. In Thirukoṭṭiyur how much tapas
     must have been done by those living there,
     where Vediyars recite the four Vedas night and day
     and cowherds graze their cattle
     with sticks from kurundam trees
     and celebrate many festivals
     and devotees folding their hands
     worship the dark cloud-like lord.

367. Thirukkoṭṭiyur is where the lovely-eyed Thirumāl
     made the good king Abhimanadungan his devotee
     so that he praised and worshiped god every day.

     that grows in that land
     where devotees sing the greatness of Govindan
     in the temple that is on the cool waterfront.

368. Thirukkoṭṭiyur is filled with flourishing fields
     and surrounded with beautiful walls that are like pure gold.
     The cuckoo birds that live on the branches of the groves there
     sing the fame of Govindan. When I see the devotees
     praising our dear Narasimhan, I want to live like them
     so my worldly desires go away.

369. Thirukoṭṭiyur is where generous people live,
     giving food to others without hiding it
     even if they need to sell whatever is in their hands for some money.
     They praise him , saying,
     “You are Kesavan, you are the Purshothaman,
     you are a shining light, you are the dwarf.”
     They would even sell themselves to do good
     for the devotees of him.

370. If those wandering without serving
     as slaves to the ancient god in Thirukkoṭṭiyur
     surrounded by fertile fields and flourishing water
     recite without mistakes
     the pāsurams of the faultless Paṭṭarpiran Vishṇuchithan
     of beautiful Puduvai,
     they will become the devotees of Rishikesa.

Advising the people to worship god before the time of their death

371. Even if people have only thought
     of their mothers, fathers, children, and wives with fragrant hair,
     if they close their eyes when they are dying and praise the god and say,
     “Kesava, Purushothama,
     you became a boar and you are faultless,”
     they are my dear friends,
     and no words are enough for me to praise them.

372. If people who were never the devotees of Nārāyaṇan
     are sick and their wounds become putrid and swarm with flies,
     and if, fainting and coming to the end of their lives,
     they fold their hands and worship him,
     saying “Namo Nārāyaṇa,”
     they will never again go near people
     who are not the devotees of Nārāyaṇan.

373. If someone has collected and saved wealth
     and if his relatives come to him before his death
     and ask greedily,
     “Tell us where you keep your wealth!
     Tell us where you keep it!”
     if he, without saying anything,
     makes his heart a temple of Madhavan,
     places the god there and sprinkles his love as flowers,
     he will be saved even if a snake comes to bite him.

374. When someone is old,
     his breathing may become thin.
     His neck will be swelling with air.
     His legs and hands will be shaking.
     If he says the mantra of one sound
     before he closes his eyes
     and thinks of him, he will go to heaven.

375. Before someone comes to the time of his death
     and the water he has drunk is spit out
     and the food that he ate is vomited
     and his eyes close,
     if he praises god saying, “Rishikesa!”
     on his way, the dogs will not come.
     No one will hurt him with their spears.
     He will not lose his wealth any time.

376. Before someone loses the sense
     of his eyes, nose, mouth, ears and touch,
     and before his breath ceases,
     and before he can no longer swallow the water
     given to him from a conch,
     and before his head sags to the side,
     if he thinks in his heart of the Māyan Madhusudhanan
     resting on the ocean, abundant with water,
     there is nothing that he cannot achieve.

377. Before the heartless messengers of Yama
     enter someone’s home like kidnappers,
     tie him with strong ropes and pull him away,
     if he worships in his heart faultlessly
     and says “O Madhusudana,
     you are my king, I am your slave!” he will reach heaven.

378. Before someone’s relatives gather together,
     speak only of his good qualities and not his faults,
     sing and sing,
     and put him on a bier and take him to the burning ground
     and leave him there in the forest
     after putting new clothes on him,
     if he sings, dances and worships the god Govindan
     adorned with the Kausthubham ornament,
     he will escape from Yama and join the god.

379. Before someone cannot speak
     and his weakening eyes shed water
     and his mother, father and wife weep,
     and before fire takes hold of his body,
     if he worships the lord
     and thinks of himself as the devotee of the lovely-eyed Thirumāl,
     and if he thinks of the god as his relative,
     he will escape from Yama’s messengers.

380. Vishṇuchithan, the chief of Villiputhur,
     composed ten pāsurams which say
     that if people worship the lord and ask for his refuge
     and become his devotees,
     before Yama’s messengers come and take them
     they will be able to reach god.
     If people learn and recite these pāsurams
     they will become devotees, thinking only of him..
---------

Advising the devotees about naming children with the names of god.

381. O poor ones!
     You gave your children mean names of the rich
     because you wanted to get money,
     clothes with decorations and other things from them.
     If you give the name of Kesavan and live worshipping him,
     the god Nāraṇan will not send
     the mothers of your children to hell.

382. O poor ones!
     You name your children the names of people
     even if they are not good,
     because you wish them to give you some clothes.
     If you call your children,
     “O lovely-eyed Neḍumāl, O Sridhara,”
     Nāraṇan will not send
     the mothers of your children to hell.

383. Why did you name your children
     with the names of those who give you oil
     to put on your children’s hair, and give ornaments
     and bracelets to decorate them?
     Even if you have to live by begging,
     you should give your children the divine name of our god Nārāṇan.
     If you do, Nāraṇan will not send
     the mothers of your children to hell.

384. You will not be blessed in your next birth
     if you give that child the name of another person than god.
     If you call your child,
     “O Madhava, king of heaven, Govinda,”
     Naraṇan who is in all hearts will not send
     the mothers of your children to hell.

385. You will not be blessed in your next birth
     if you give the name of another human
     born from an unclean womb.
     If you call him, saying, “O Govinda, Govinda!
     You have been born in a good family!”
     Nāraṇan who does only good things for all
     will not send the mothers of your children to hell.

386. Do not give human names to your children
     like others joining with the people
     of your country and town and celebrating with them
     the name ceremony for their children.
     Do not fall in the ditch like them.
     If you approach the god and worship him saying,
     “O Nāraṇa, you destroyed the Asuran when he came as a cart.
     You are our chief, O Damodara!”
     he will not send the mothers of your children to hell.

387. O, ignorant ones!
     Your children are human
     and they were born from unclean bodies
     and will return to the earth.
     You gave them the name of people
     and do not realize what you have done is not good.
     Think of giving the name of the dark cloud-colored one
     who is sweet to the eyes.
     Approach Nāraṇan.
     He will not send the mothers of your children to hell.

388. If you give your children the names of village people
     such as “nambi, pimbi,” those “manbu, pimbu”
     will be forgotten in a few days.
     If you give them the name of the lovely lotus-eyed lord,
     O friends, Nāraṇan will not send the mothers of your children to hell.

389. Giving the name of the dark cloud-colored god
     to your children born in an unclean body
     is like pouring nectar into a dirty ditch.
     But if you wear the nāmam
     and dance and sing the praise of Nāraṇan
     who is never false to his promises,
     he will not send the mothers of your children to hell.

390. Vishṇuchithan from the ancient village of Veeraṇai,
     is praised by all, always,
     and he worshipped the divine name of Thirumāl.
     He composed ten beautiful Tamil pāsurams about how people
     should name their children with the names of the god.
     If devotees recite these ten beautiful pāsurams
     they will go to the divine splendid Vaikuṇṭam
     and stay there happily forever.

     and touches the breasts of women with vine-like waists
     and enters into the groves that grow thick on the hills.

     describing the divine Srirangam,
     the Thiruppadi of the auspicious god
     who fought and destroyed Ravaṇa when he, with many boons,
     came with a large army and opposed Rāma.

     like the divine feet of him who measured the sky
     and good paddy plants bend their heads worshipping his feet.

     a dwarf, Parasurāman, Balarāman, Rāma, Kaṇṇan
     and Kalki, the form that will end the world.
     His Thiruppadi is Srirangam surrounded with rippling water
     where a male swan with its mate climbs on a lovely lotus,
     swings on it and jumps on a flower bed,
     plunging into it and playing in the beautiful pollen.

     defeats his enemies and rules the world.

Requesting the god to come and help when Yama’s messengers come.

423. When they are old, people go to others who are strong
     because they believe they will help them.
     Even though I am not worthy to approach you,
     I come to you for refuge
     because you saved the elephant Gajendra
     from the crocodile when it seized him.
     When I become old and my time comes to an end
     and I am suffering, I may not be able even to think of you.

     terrifying me because they think my time is up,
     you must come and protect me.

427. You, the highest one
     resting on Adishesha, the snake on the milky ocean,
     made Nanmuhan on your navel
     so that he could create all the creatures of the world,
     and you also made Yama because you thought
     that the lives of people in this world should not be endless.
     O dear lord! You should protect me now.

428. O god, you are the earth, ocean, fire, wind and the sky!
     The Kingarars, the evil messengers of Yama

The poet's request

433. O Mādhava, because I do not know
     how to say anything that is good I do not praise you
     but still my tongue says nothing but your names.
     I am afraid, nothing is under my control.
     You may be angry with me
     because you think I speak as someone ignorant,
     but I cannot stop my tongue.
     Great ones find meaningful things
     even in the calling of crows.
     You are the reason for everything,
     O lord, with an eagle banner.

434. I compose worthless pāsurams with my useless tongue.
     You carry a conch and a discus in your hands.
     Is it not the duty of the great to forgive the mistaken words of their servants?
     My eyes can only see through your eyes
     and my mind will not think of any other god except you.
     I am like a deer—
     one more dot on its coat does not spoil its loveliness.
     Surely it is not too much for you to accept my mistakes.
     O lord, you swallowed all the seven worlds and spat them out.

435. I do not know what is good or what is bad,
     all I know is to say, “Nāraṇā.”
     Before, I said unworthy things about you
     but now I only praise you. See, O Thirumāl,
     I do not even know how to think of you.
     Always I say, ‘Namo Nāraṇa, Namo Nāraṇa.”
     My only strength is that I am a Vaishaṇavan
     and live in your temple.

436. You, the pure, tall god,
     measured this world with your body.
     Do not hesitate to make me your slave.
     Though I do not want any clothes or food
     I still have not became your slave
     and am wandering here and there.
     O lord, you killed the cruel Kamsan
     and cut the chains of Vasudevan, your father,
     when he was in prison and released him.

437. I have placed all my property, wife, cattle, waterways,
     lands and wells and anything that I have
     under your golden feet without any worry.
     It is hard for me to deal with my villagers
     because they are jealous that I own so much.
     O lord, you who took the form of a boar,
     and dug up the earth to bring back the earth goddess
     and broke the tusk of the elephant and killed it,
     I need your help.

438. O dear lord, dark colored creator
     of the four-headed Nānmuhan
     and the reason for everything,
     even if I, your devotee, do not eat, I do not get hungry
     because worshiping you takes my hunger away.
     If there is a day when I do not think of you,
     and do not always say, “Namo Nāraṇa”
     and do not recite Rig and Sama Vedas
     and do not place fresh flowers on your feet,
     that will be the day I starve.

439. You pretend to sleep
     on the white flood of ocean on a snake bed,
     but when I want to see you sleeping on the snake bed,
     my heart becomes weak and I sob with happiness,
     my hair stands on end, my eyes shed tears
     and I cannot rest at all.
     O tell me, how I can reach you.

440. You carried the huge beautiful Govardhana mountain,
     used it as an umbrella and protected the cowherds
     and the cows from the storm. O Madhusudanan, Kaṇṇa,
     who released the elephant Gajendra from his suffering
     and killed the elephant Kuvalayabeeḍam,
     you, the reason for everything,
     remove the troubles of your worshipers.
     You are so famous that I do not have the words to praise you.
     O my dear lord, give me your grace
     so that I may approach you and worship you every day.

441. You are my friend
     and the god of those who praise you with love.
     The god of the gods in the sky,
     you took the form of a man-lion, you measured all the seven worlds,
     and you are the apocalypse.
     You, the reason for everything,
     removed the suffering of the elephant Gajendra
     when he was caught by a crocodile
     and you churned the milky ocean with the gods in the sky. .
     Make me your devotee and protect me.
     I am weak—remove my suffering.

442. He is Mādhavan and Madhusudanan,
     the emerald-colored father of Kama, a lion to his enemies
     who took the form of a dark-haired dwarf and is sweet for me.
     Vishṇuchithan the chief of Puduvai
     that flourishes with goodness
     composed ten wonderful Tamil pāsurams on him.
     If devotees recite these pāsurams
     they will reach the world of Nāraṇan soon.

Asking diseases to go away because the god will protect the Azhvar and his devotees.

443. O diseases that stay and spread on our bodies
     like the ants that swarm around the ghee pot and climb on it,
     you go away and we want to become well.
     The god of the Vedas entered into my body
     and stays there lying on the snake bed.
     It is not my old body.
     God is there now and he protects it.

444. The plan that Chitragupthan wrote
     by the order of Yama, the king of the southern direction,
     is canceled and the messengers of Yama
     have run and hidden themselves, leaving me alone
     because I am a slave of the devotees of the ancient god,
     the all-knowing one resting on the ocean,
     the lord of the wise and nectar for his devotees.
     My body is not the same as it was.
     God is in it now and he protects me.

445. My lord who brought me from my mother’s womb
     helped me control the desires of my five senses,
     removed the craving of this body of nerves and flesh,
     and kept the messengers of Yama
     from binding me with ropes and taking me away.
     He taught me to become his devotee night and day and serve him.
     My body is not the same as it was.
     God is in it now and he protects me.

     because of their bad karma,
     but see, there is also bad karma for you.
     Do not enter my body, do not enter it.
     Do you see how it is not easy to enter my body?

     where the lord who took the form of a man-lion stays.
     Go away or you will be in trouble.
     My body is not the same as it was.
     He is in it now and he protects me.

447. O diseases, I made Māyan
     who took the form of a dwarf
     enter my mind and I kept him there with love.
     I have nothing else in my mind.
     See, my mind is a precious treasure that keeps a diamond.
     He is strong and he is mischievous.
     Do not hesitate. Go away.
     My body is not the same as it was.
     God is in it now and he protects me.

448. O diseases that bring suffering to people,
     I will tell you something, listen.

     There is nothing you can have here.
     You should go away.

449. I was attracted, slipped and fell into the small cave
     that is called a woman’s breast.

Requesting the god of Thirumālirunjolai not to leave the devotee’s heart.

453. O father, lord of Thirumālirunjolai,
     I released myself from the sufferings of this world,
     became your devotee and saw you.
     I will not allow you to leave my heart.
     O lord, you came to this world
     and were born from the womb of Devaki
     as her seventh child after she had lost six children.

454. I embraced you, keep you in my heart.
     and will not allow you to leave me.
     If you hide yourself with your magical tricks
     I swear by you that what you do is not right.
     You, my father, are lord of Thirumālirunjolai
     surrounded with pure water
     that removes the bad karma
     of the people of all lands and all cities.

455. I have done much tapas to serve you.
     If I go to another god and serve him,
     it will destroy your pride,
     god of beautiful Thirumālirunjolai
     where a gypsy tribe plants grain in the earth,
     grows new crops, worships you and says,
     “We worship your golden feet
     and eat the new grain.”

456. O father, lord of Thirimālirunjolai,
     I suffered wandering many miles in this life.
     There is no shade for me here
     and there is no water for me here.
     I see no refuge that would let me survive
     except the shade beneath your feet.
     O god, you went as a messenger for the Paṇḍavas,

     and were the cause of the deaths of all those
     who died on the battlefield in Kurukshetra.

     and the tears from my eyes do not stop.
     My body becomes weak and trembles.
     I cannot speak. I shiver,
     my arms are twisted and I can’t make them straight.
     My mind is fascinated by you and thinks only of you
     and I begin to praise you and live,
     O my father, lord of Thirumālirunjolai
     surrounded by springs where fish frolic.

458. Shiva with his bull banner,
     Nanmuhan, Indra and all others
     do not know the cure for the sickness that is this birth.
     You, beautiful like a bright sapphire,
     are the healer who can cure the sickness that is birth.
     O my father, lord of Thirumālirunjolai,
     give me your grace so I may enter your world
     and not be born again.

459. I was plunged in the sufferings of this world
     and now by your generous grace have been released from them.
     I am tired. Please give me your grace and say to me,
     “Don’t be afraid.”
     O god of Thirumālirunjolai with a shining discus,

     you wear silk garments,
     and your body has the color of the red evening sky.

460. I thought I could see you today or tomorrow.
     I suffered longing to see you
     for many ages and many eons.
     Now I will not leave you
     who destroyed all the hundred Kauravas,
     and gave life to their enemies the Pandavas, your brothers-in-law.
     Don’t you know that my heart is with you,
     O my father, god of Thirumālirunjolai?

461. Even when I was in my mother’s womb
     I wanted to serve you as a slave.
     I was born in this world and I found you—
     how could I leave you
     who fought with Baṇasuran
     and with your discus cut off his thousand arms,
     scattering them in all the directions,
     O my father, lord of Thirumālirunjolai.

462. Vishṇuchittan the chief of Puduvai
     that is filled with golden shining palaces,
     composed pāsurams about the lord of Thirumālirunjolai
     where people of the world go and play in the spring water.

     What do you want me to do now?

464. You are the highest god
     who rides on the eagle Garuḍa.

     and I have plunged into the river of nectar of knowledge.

465. You, the god of my family, my master, entered my heart.
     Who could ever get the goodness that I have received?
     All the sins of the world that made me suffer
     have run away and hidden in the bushes.

466. O lord with arms as strong as mountains
     and a discus and the bow saragam in your hands,
     you are the servant of your devotees.
     Like the gods when they churned the ocean of milk
     and filled a pot with nectar,
     I opened my mouth and filled my body with you
     and my heart melted. Even cruel Yama
     will not be able to come near my feet with his club.

467. You are my father, my Rishikeshan,
     and the protector of my life.
     Like someone who brightens gold
     by rubbing it on a touchstone,
     through your grace I kept you faultlessly
     and praised you with my tongue and in my heart.
     .
468. You are Rāma and the best among men.
     You carried an axe in your left hand
     when you came to the earth as Balarāma to rule the world.
     As if I were drawing on a wall,
     I drew your form in my heart perfectly
     and you came to me, O my dear one,
     Don’t go anywhere leaving me.

469. O lord who broke the tusks of the elephant Kuvalayabeeḍam, .
     fought and defeated the wrestlers,
     like the king of the Pandya country
     who placed his mark on the mountains,
     you placed your bright, divine feet on my head
     and made me your own.
     I have always praised your name with my good tongue.

470. You, a tall one with a discus,
     you came into my heart
     along with Adishesha and Garuḍāzhvar,
     stayed there and made me alive.
     My heart melts when I think how you stay there,
     tears fill my eyes and flow down
     and I need only think of you for my sorrows to disappear.

471. You left your snake bed on the cool ocean,
     came running to me,
     and now you stay in the ocean of my heart.
     You who are my magical and beloved god,
     the Māyan, the best of all
     the beloved of Nappinnai,
     a matchless ocean and a precious light
     are the unique world.
     You made my heart your abode and you own me.

472. O, dear one, you, a light,
     stay in my heart like a shining lamp
     and are like a tall bright coral vine that grows on a large hill.
     You did not want to stay in the northern ocean, in Vaikuṇṭam,
     in Dwarapuri surrounded by walls, or in other places.
     You left them all and came into my heart.

473. Vishṇuchithan, born in the tribe of the Veyar,
     praises him, the cowherd,
     the beautiful cool cloud-colored lord,
     the bull of the cowherds,
     the king of gods and the nectar of the Andanars.
     If devotees sing the pāsurams of Vishṇuchittan
     they will reach him as his shadows.

## 02. Aṇḍal.: Thiruppāvai (474 -503)

Girls waking up their friends.

474. The girls come and wake up their friends. They say,
     “Today is the auspicious full moon day of Markazhi month.
     O you adorned with beautiful ornaments,
     let us go bathe. Come!
     We are the beloved young girls of the flourishing cowherd village.
     Nārāyaṇan, the son of Nandagopan,
     who looks after the cows with a sharp spear,
     the young lion of lovely-eyed Yashoda
     with a dark body, beautiful eyes
     and a face bright as the shining moon
     will give us the Paṛai.
     Come and let us bathe and worship our Pāvai
     as the world praises him.”

475. The girls come to wake up their friends. They say,
     “O people of the world!
     Hear how we worship our pāvai.
     We worship the feet of the highest lord
     resting on the milky ocean.
     We don't eat ghee, we don't drink milk,
     we bathe early in the morning,
     we don't put kohl to darken our eyes,
     we don't decorate our hair with flowers,
     we don't do evil things, we don't gossip.
     We give alms to all beggars and sages.
     Come and let us be happy and worship our Pāvai.”

476. The girls come to wake up their friends. They say,
     “Let us sing and praise the name of the virtuous lord
     who measured the world with his tall form
     and let us decorate our Pāvai and bathe it.
     If we do that, rain will fall three times a month
     without fail all over our land,
     paddy in the fields will flourish,
     fish will frolic in the fields,
     bees will sleep on the buds of the kuvaḷai blossoms
     and the cows will not hide their milk
     but yield generously to fill up the pots
     when the cowherds milk them.
     Let riches be abundant!
     Come and let us bathe and worship our Pāvai.”

477. The girls come to wake up their friends. They say,
     “O Varuṇa, you take water from the ocean.
     Do not hide your rain.
     O cloud, you enter the ocean, scoop up water and rise,
     looking like the dark form of the lord of the eon,
     making lightning like the discus that shines in the hands of Padmanabhan,
     roaring with thunder like the sound of his conch,
     and pouring rain like the arrows from his Sarngam bow.
     O Varuṇa, give us rain so that the people of the world may live happily.
     Come and let us bathe joyfully in this month of Markazhi
     and go to worship our Pāvai.”

478. The girls come to wake up their friends. They say,
     “He, the bright light of cowherd clan,
     Damodaran who made his mother's womb divine,
     the young Māyan, the king of northern Mathura,
     grew up playing on the banks of the Jamuna river
     whose water is abundant and pure.
     Faultless, we come, sprinkle flowers, worship him,
     sing his praises and think only of him in our minds.
     All the bad things we have done and may do
     will disappear like dust in fire.
     Let us go and worship our Pāvai.”

479. The girls come to wake up their friends. They say,
     “See, the birds are singing.
     Do you hear the loud calling of the white conch
     in the temple of the god of Garuḍa?
     O friend, get up.
     He, the seed of the world
     who drank the poison from Putanā's breasts
     and destroyed the cheating Sakaṭāsuran,
     rests on the ocean on the snake Adishesha.
     Sages and yogis rise and praise him saying, “Hari, Hari!”
     Listen to their praise and get up, happy in your heart.
     Let us go and worship our Pāvai.”

480. The girls come to wake up their friends . They say,
     “O crazy one, don't you hear the sound of the sparrows flocking together
     and calling “keech, keech” everywhere?
     The cowherd women with fragrant hair and many ornaments
     are churning the yogurt. Don't you hear their sound?
     You are a queen of the cowherd village.
     How can you sleep when you hear people
     singing the praise of Kesavan?
     You shine brightly! Open the door.
     Let us go and worship our Pāvai.”

481. The girls come to wake up their friend. They say,
     “The east is growing bright
     and the buffaloes leave their small sheds and go to graze.
     Women are about to do their nombu,
     but we have stopped them so they will wait for you
     and we have come to wake you up.
     Get up, cheerful one!
     If we sing his praise wishing to get the Paṛai
     and worship the god of gods who split open the mouth
     of the Asuran Kesi when he came as a horse
     and fought with the wrestlers and defeated them,
     he will give us his grace.
     That would be a wonderful thing.
     Let us go and worship our Pāvai.”

482. The girls come to wake up their friends. They say,
     “O my uncle’s daughter, it is morning
     and still you are sleeping on your bed in your room
     where the fragrance of incense spreads everywhere
     and the lamps on all sides of the palace
     studded with pure jewels shine.
     Open your beautiful door.
     O aunts, won't you wake her up?
     Doesn't your daughter speak? Doesn't she hear?
     Has some magic put her into deep sleep?
     Let us praise the god singing his many names,
     saying ‘You are the Māyan, Madhavan, Vaikuṇṭan!’
     Let us go and worship our Pāvai.”

483. The girls come to wake up their friends. They say,
     “You want to find happiness doing your nombu
     but you don’t open the door and don’t answer us.
     The virtuous Nārāyaṇan, adorned with a thulasi garland,
     will give us the Paṛai.
     Does Kumbakarṇan who fell into the mouth of Yama in battle
     make you sleep so soundly?
     You are very lazy! You are a precious ornament!
     Wake up and open the door.
     Let us go and worship our Pāvai.”

484. The girls come to wake up their friends. They say,
     “You are as beautiful as a golden vine,
     the daughter of the faultless cowherds, owners of many cows,
     who fight their enemies bravely and destroy their valor.
     You are as beautiful as a forest peacock, get up.
     Your friends in the neighborhood have come
     and stand in your front yard
     and praise the fame of the dark cloud-colored Kaṇṇan
     but you have not stirred from your bed.
     O dear girl, you have not said a word.
     Why are you sleeping like this?
     Let us go and worship our Pāvai.”

485. The girls come to wake up their friends. They say,
     “You come from a rich family.
     The buffaloes that just gave birth
     drip milk from their udders lovingly, thinking of their calves,
     and the front yard of the house is wet with their milk.
     We sing praising the names of the sweet god
     who angrily destroyed the king of southern Lanka
     but you haven’t opened your mouth.
     Wake up. Why do you sleep like this?
     Don't you know all the people in your house are up?
     Let us go and worship our Pāvai.”

486. The girls come to wake up their friends. They say,
     All other girls, singing and praising the fame of him
     who killed the evil Rakshasa Ravaṇa,
     and split open the mouth of the Asuran
     when he came as a bird
     have gone to worship the Pāvai.
     The star Guru fades and the Sukran rises.
     See, the birds are awake and chatter.
     Why are you with eyes like blossoms
     sleeping without coming with us
     to bathe and play in the cool water?
     Today is an auspicious day.
     Don’t pretend to sleep.
     Come and join us.
     Let us go and worship our Pāvai.”

487. The girls come to wake up their friends. They say,
     “See, in your backyard, in the pond in your garden,
     senkazhuneer flowers open and ambal flowers close.
     Sages, doing pure tapas and wearing clothes
     that are red like powdered brick
     go to the divine temple to blow their conches.
     O young girl, you said you would wake us up.
     Aren't you ashamed? Get up.
     You don’t do the things that you say you will.
     Come, let us sing and praise the lotus-eyed god
     with a conch and discus in his strong hands.
     Let us go and worship our Pāvai.”

488. The girls come to wake up their friends. They say,
     “You are as beautiful as a young parrot.
     What is this? You’re still asleep—wake up.!”
     She answers, “Don’t shout and wake me up.
     I am a poor girl and you are as bright as lightning. I’m coming.”
     They say, “We know your tricks. You always say this.”
     She answers, “You are the clever ones.
     Let me be what I am.”
     They say, “Come quickly. We can’t wait for you.”
     She asks, “Have all our friends arrived?”
     They say, “Yes, They’re all here.
     If you want, come and count them.
     Come and sing the praise of the Māyan
     whose strength destroys the might of his enemies.
     Let us go and worship our Pāvai.”
----------

The girls wake up the god and ask for the Paṛai.

489. The girls take to the guards of Nandagopan's palace.
     “You are the guard of the palace of the lord Nandagopan
     who protect the doors that are decorated with flags and festoons.
     The dark jewel-colored Māyavan
     said yesterday that he would give
     a sounding Paṛai to us, the cowherd girls.
     We have bathed to make ourselves pure
     and have come to sing and wake him up.
     O guard! Don’t say this or that and make excuses.
     Open the front door of this palace!
     We are going to worship our Pāvai.”

490. The girls come to wake up Nandagopan, Yashoda,
     Baladevan and the gods, say,
     “O Nandagopalan, dear lord of the cowherds
     who give clothes, water and food to all, get up!
     O Yashoda, tender shoot among all the women who are soft as vines,
     the bright light of your family, and our dear one, get up.
     O king of the gods with feet adorned with pure golden anklets.
     You grew tall, split the sky and measured the world.
     Dear one, do not sleep. Get up.
     O Baladeva, don't sleep with your little brother.
     We are going to worship our Pāvai

     “O, fragrant-haired Nappinnai,
     daughter-in-law of strong-armed Nandagopan,
     who own of many rutting elephants, open the door.
     The roosters are calling to wake everyone
     and the flock of cuckoo birds sitting on the vines
     blooming with mādhavi flowers call out.
     Come, your fingers are beautiful and soft,
     open the door so the lovely bracelets
     on your beautiful lotus hands jingle.

     and praise the name of your husband.

492. The girls coming to wake up the god and Nappinnai say,
     “O Thirumāl adorned with garlands,
     you sleep on the breasts of Nappinnai,
     adorned with beautiful flowers on her hair,
     on a soft mattress on an ivory cot
     and the room is bright with lights.
     O Nappinnai with kohl-darkened eyes, open your mouth,
     How could you not get up and want to see your beloved?
     Surely you can understand
     that you won’t be able to be away from him for long.
     This isn’t good for you.
     We are going to worship our Pāvai

493. The girls coming to wake up the lord and Nappinnai say,
     “O dear god, if any of the thirty-three crores of the gods
     have troubles, you go and remove them.
     Get up, faultless, strong one,
     vex your enemies and take care of your devotees.
     O beautiful young Nappinnai
     with soft breasts like small cheppus,
     a red mouth and a tiny waist, get up!

     and we stay by your bed and worship you.
     Won't your beautiful lotus eyes
     bright as the sun and the moon,
     show us even a little grace?
     If you look at us, our karma will go away.
     We are going to worship our Pāvai

496. The girls coming to wake up the god say,
     “As you, colored as dark as a kāyam flower, wake up
     you are like a lion that has slept
     in a mountain cave in the rainy season,
     that opens its fiery eyes and roars, its mane hanging low.
     You come from your temple and sit on your majestic throne.
     Give us your grace, and help us.
     We are going to worship our Pāvai

     You went to southern Lanka and killed the Rakshasas.
     We praise your strength.
     You destroyed Sakaṭāsuran when he came as a cart.
     We praise your fame.
     When Vathsasuran came as a calf you threw him
     at Kabithasuran who had taken the form of a vilam tree
     and killed them both.
     We worship your ankleted feet.
     You carried Govardhana mountain to save the cows.
     We praise your compassion.
     We praise the spear in your hands that conquers your enemies.

498. The girls ask for the Paṛai saying,
     “In the night you were born to Devaki
     and were raised by Yashoda.
     This is something no one knows.
     You were like a burning fire in Kamsan’s stomach
     because he always thought of giving you trouble.
     Kamsan always wanted to hurt you
     but you fought with him and killed him.
     O Neḍumāl! We worship you and have come here to you.
     If you give us the Paṛai,
     we will sing and praise your wealth and grace
     and our sorrows will go away and we will be happy.

499. The girls ask the god for the things that they need for their nombu
     and say,

     Hear us! Give us the things we need for our nombu.
     We want to have white milk-colored conches
     that will roar and shake the earth like your conch, the pancajanyam.
     We want many good Paṛais.
     We want to be with people singing “Pallaṇḍu!”to you.

     We are going to worship our Pāvai.”

500. The girls, coming to ask for Parais, ornaments and clothes, say,
     “O Govinda, conquerer of your enemies,
     we wish to receive a Paṛai from you and praise you.
     We want many gifts—bracelets, earrings, earrings, anklets
     and other ornaments that everyone desires
     and we will be happy to wear them.
     Wearing beautiful clothes,
     we will join together and eat rice with milk, pouring ghee in it,
     and as we eat the ghee will drip from our elbows.
     We are going to worship our Pāvai.”

501. The girls, asking for a Paṛai from the god, say,
     “We go behind the cattle to the forest
     to eat our food there.
     You were raised with simple cowherd people.
     We are fortunate to be born in the same place as you
     O faultless Govindan, we cannot give up our closeness to you.
     We, innocent children,
     call you with simple names because we love you.
     Do not get upset with us.
     Give us the Paṛai and give us your grace.
     We are going to worship our Pāvai.”

502. The cowherd girls say,
     “We come early in the morning and worship you
     and praise your golden feet. Hear us.
     Just like you, we were born in the cowherd clan.
     We want to serve you and receive the Paṛai from you.
     See, Govindan, we want to be with you always
     and we will serve you in all our fourteen births.
     Give us your grace
     and keep us from wanting anything but your service.
     We are going to worship our Pāvai.”

503. Paṭṭarpirān Kodai from Puduvai
     adorned with a beautiful lotus garland
     composed thirty Tamil pāsurams about how the girls
     with lovely moon-like faces,
     decorated with beautiful ornaments,
     went to Madhavan, Kesavan who churned the wavy ocean of milk,
     and asked for the Paṛai.
     If devotees recite these pāsurams without mistakes
     they will receive the grace of rich Thirumal,
     with a lovely face, beautiful eyes
     and twelve strong mountain-like arms
     and be happy.
--------------------
## 03. Aṇḍal.: Nāchiyār Thirumozhi (504-646)

The cowherd women worship Kāma, the god of love.

504. We clean the floor in the month of Thai
     and decorate it with beautiful kolams.
     In the month of Masi we use soft white powder
     and make lovely decorations in our front yard.
     O Kamadeva, I worship you and your brother Saman.
     I wonder, can I survive this love sickness?
     Give me the boon of belonging to the lord of Thiruvenkaṭam
     holding a discus in his hand that throws out fire.

505. We decorate our front yard with soft white sand.
     We bathe at dawn when the sun comes out
     and make fire with sticks that have no thorns.
     I make all efforts to worship you, O Kamadeva
     with your flower arrows that drip honey.
     I write the name of the ocean-colored one in my mind.
     Give me your grace so I may enter the place of him
     who split open the mouth of the Asuran when he came as a bird.

506. I worship your feet all three times of the day
     placing fragrant umatham flowers and blossoms of murukkam on them.
     O Manmatha, I don’t want to be angry with you
     and scold you, saying that you are heartless.
     Get ready with your fresh flower arrows
     and give me your grace
     so I may enter into the brightness
     of the clever lord of Venkaṭam hills.

507. O Kamadeva, god without a body,
     I wrote your name on the wall,
     and I made a fish flag and gave it to you
     with horses, fans and a sugarcane-bow.
     I worshipped you and asked you to give me your grace
     so that my round breasts
     would belong at once to the lord of Dwarapuri.

508. If people wish to give me away in marriage
     so that my round breasts belong to someone human
     instead of the pure lord with a conch and discus,
     it would be as if foxes that wander in the forest
     came and ate the food that the sages make in a sacrifice
     for the gods in the sky. O Manmatha,
     I will not live if I have to marry someone other than my lord.

509. I am doing nombu on the streets where you will be going
     with beautiful young girls who know the sastras, O Kamadeva.
     He has the dark color of the clouds and the kāyām flower
     and shines like a karuvilai blossom.
     Give me your grace
     so that the lotus-faced lord will see me with his divine eyes
     and give me his grace.START

510. I offer paddy, sugarcane,
     cooked rice with brown sugar and aval
     and worship you reciting the manthras from the sastras.
     O Manmatha, I bow to you.
     Give me your grace so that Thirivikraman
     who measured the world
     will touch me with his divine hands.
     Give me your grace so that he will approach me
     and touch my breasts.

511. I don’t bathe when it is time for my nombu.
     I don’t comb my hair. I eat once a day
     and my mouth grows pale because I haven’t eaten enough.
     You can see how I suffer for this nombu.
     I want tell you something:
     Kesavan Nambi fought with the Asuran Kesi to protect a woman.
     Give me your grace so that he will show me the same compassion
     and I will have the fortune of sitting with him and pressing his feet.

512. I sprinkle flowers and worship you
     and bow to your feet three times a day.
     If I am unable to live for the dark ocean-colored lord
     and to serve him faultlessly,
     I will cry and suffer and you, Kamadeva, will feel bad.
     It will be as if you didn’t feed an ox that plows
     and hit it with a stick instead.

513. Vishṇuchithan Kodai, the chief of Puduvai
     where the mountain-like palaces shine
     composed pāsurams about the women
     who worshiped Kama,
     with a sugarcane bow and flower arrows.
     and how they wanted his grace
     so that they might be with the god
     who broke the tusks of the elephant
     and split open the beak of the bird.
-----------

Women asks Kaṇṇan not to destroys their sand houses.

514. O Nārāyaṇā praised with a thousand names,
     if Yashoda had given birth to you,
     it would be easy for us to love you
     because you would be human just like we are.
     We do nombu in the month of Punguni
     because that is the month when Kama comes.
     O Sridhara, don’t bother us,
     don’t come and destroy our little sand houses.

515. We worked all day to build these sand houses and our backs hurt.
     Look at our sand houses. They make us happy.
     O ancient one who slept on a banyan leaf as a baby,
     it is a pity that you are not kind to us.
     Do not come and destroy our little sand houses.

516. You who sleep on the deep ocean
     took the form of a lion to destroy Hiraṇyan
     and saved Gajendra from the mouth of the crocodile.
     When we saw you and fell in love with you,
     you looked at us out of the corner of your eye
     and didn’t worry about what we might think.
     We worked hard to make our houses with soft sand
     and our bangled hands hurt.
     O lord, you rest on the ocean where clear waves roll.
     Do not come and destroy our little sand houses.

517. O lord, you have the color of the rain-giving clouds
     and your speech and deeds fascinate us.
     What spell does your beautiful face cast to bewitch us?
     We won’t complain to others
     that you trouble us innocent, weak girls.
     We don’t want them to blame you
     with your lovely lotus eyes.
     Don’t come and destroy our little sand houses.

518. We made our sand houses with soft white sand
     and everyone on the street was amazed
     when they saw our lovely sand houses
     but you came and destroyed them.
     Even so we aren’t angry at you.
     Our hearts melt for your love.
     You are a thief, Madhavan, Kesavan.
     Don't you have eyes on your face?
     Don’t come and destroy our little sand houses.

519. We are children, not grown-up yet,
     and our breasts haven’t grown out.
     You come here to knock over our little sand houses
     but really wanting to do something else.
     We don’t understand what you want.
     You who built a bridge on the ocean, went to Lanka,
     and fought and destroyed the Raksasa clan
     are the servant of all of your devotees.
     Don’t give us trouble,
     don’t come and destroy our little sand houses.

520. If you talk to people who understand what you say,
     that will be all right,
     but if you talk to us who are young and don’t know anything,
     it just hurts us. What do you gain from that?
     You who have the color of the wide sounding ocean
     and built the bridge Sethu
     will get in trouble with your wives.
     Don’t come and destroy our little sand houses.

521. We brought a pot, a winnowing fan and sand,
     built sand houses and are playing as we like.
     What is the use of destroying our sand houses?
     What do you get if you come
     and kick them down and give us trouble?
     Ocean-colored wone with a shining discus in your hand,
     don’t you know that even jaggery will not be sweet
     if your mind is bitter?
     Don’t come and destroy our little sand houses.

522. O Govinda, you enter our yard and, smiling,
     not only destroy do you our little sand houses,
     you destroy our hearts as well.
     You measured the earth
     and grew tall and measured the sky.
     What will those standing near us say
     if you come and embrace us?
     Do not come and destroy our little sand houses.

523. Vishṇuchithan Kodai, the chief of Villiputhur
     where Vediyar recite the Vedas
     composed pāsurams about what the cowherd girls
     playing and making little sand houses said to Kaṇṇan.
     They said, “You who drank the nectar of the mouth of Sita,
     do not destroy our little sand houses.”
     If devotees learn these pāsurams well
     they will go to Vaikuṇṭam.

Cowherd girls asking Kaṇṇan to give their clothes.

524. We got up in the morning before the rooster crowed
     and came to bathe, plunging into the water.
     Our beloved sun god rises coming on his chariot.
     You who rest on a snake bed give us trouble.
     We won’t come to the pond from now on.
     I and my friends worship you. Give us our clothes.

525. Why did you come here,
     dear one, how did you come to this pond?
     You, the Māyan, as sweet as nectar,
     are adorned with a thulasi garland dripping with honey.
     O, clever one! We will not leave you even it is our fate.
     Don’t go away here and there.
     Don’t take our clothes like this.
     You who danced on the snake Kalingan,
     give us back the clothes you put on the kurundam tree.

526. It is early morning.
     What is this childishness?
     If my relatives see this, they won’t like it,
     but you don’t think what you do is naughty.
     You sit on the kurundam tree and we can’t reach you.
     We will give you whatever you want.
     Give us back our clothes.
     We will go away and no one will see your mischief.
     O god you destroyed Lanka with your bow,

527. We plunge into the pond and bathe.
     We look everywhere
     and make sure no one is looking.
     Our eyes don’t want to stop shedding tears
     because we don’t have our clothes.
     You don’t have any pity on us.
     O lord who destroyed Lanka,
     we know that you were the king of the monkeys.
     Give us back the clothes
     you put on the kurundam tree.

528. My brothers with spears will come running
     even if they hear that valai and kayal fish
     are biting our feet in the pond.
     It is not a joke.
     O lord with a beautiful dark-colored body,
     don’t stay on the kurundam tree with our beautiful clothes.
     Give us back our silk clothes.

529. The stalks of the lotus plants
     that bloom in the pond hurt our feet
     and it feels as if scorpions were biting us.
     We can’t bear the pain.
     We can’t stay in the water for a long time.
     You, the king, can throw pots in the sky
     and dance the kuthu dance.
     Don’t be mischievous.
     Give us back our silk clothes.

530. We are sitting in the water, tired
     while you are doing things you shouldn’t.
     Our houses are far away.
     You are the god who knows
     what will happen when the world ends.
     We really love you.
     If our mothers see us, they won’t like it.
     Drop our silk clothes down to us.
     Don’t sit in the top of the kurundam tree
     blooming with flowers.

531. All the women, the mothers-in-law
     and others are here bathing.
     We couldn’t close our beautiful flower-like eyes in the night
     thinking of your naughty acts.
     This isn’t good for us.
     We are telling you about all the troubles you cause.
     You are the beautiful jewel-like son of the cowherd village.
     Give us the clothes back
     that you put on the kurundam tree.

532. You escaped from the trap of Kamsan
     and survived in the dark night when you were born.
     Is it because you wanted to bother us like this?
     Yashoda loves you so much
     that she doesn’t scold you even if you are naughty.
     She just leaves you to do whatever you want.
     You weren’t ashamed to drink the milk
     of the wicked Rakshasi Putanā.
     Give us back our clothes.

533. Vishṇuchithan Kodai the chief of Puduvai
     surrounded by golden palaces
     composed with beautiful music
     a garland of ten Tamil pāsurams
     describing the play of the dark lord
     with the young girls.
     If devotees learn and recite these pāsurams
     they will go to Vaikuṇṭam
     and be with the eternal god Mādhavan.

She asks the cuckoo to call the god.

545. The beautiful sapphire-colored lord
     is the eternal Madhavan praised by all in the world,
     the king decorated with a crown studded with jewels.
     He gives me trouble.
     My conch bangles have become loose
     because I have fallen in love with him.
     O cuckoo bird living in holes
     in punnai, kurukkathi, nyāzhal and cherundi trees,
     won’t you coo and call at all times of the day
     for the one with a coral-colored mouth to come quickly to me?

546. The faultless one who carries
     a sounding white conch in his left hand
     does not show his form to me.
     He entered my heart and makes me long for his love.
     See, he is taking my life away and playing with my feelings.
     O cuckoo bird, you drink the honey that drips
     from the blooming shenbaga flowers and sing happily.
     Don’t be lazy and prattle, just sing and be happy.
     Coo and call so the lord of Venkaṭam hill will come to me.

547. As Rāma he fought with Ravaṇan
     while the charioteer Madali drove his chariot,
     and he cut off all the ten heads of Ravaṇan,
     shooting his arrows like rain.
     I don’t see him coming to me.
     O cuckoo bird, you live with your beloved mate
     listening to the kāmaram music of the bees
     that have dots on their bodies
     in the groves where fragrant flowers bloom
     and spread their smell.
     Coo and call the dark-colored one
     shining like a diamond so he will come to me.

548. My bones melt,
     my long spear-like eyes do not close.
     I have entered an ocean of sorrow
     and cannot find the boat that is the Vaikundan
     to escape my suffering.
     O cuckoo bird,
     you know how hard it is to be apart from your beloved.
     Coo and call the virtuous one with a golden body and an eagle flag
     and make him come to me.

549. He stays in Villiputhur
     where the swans that walk softly play.
     My fish-like eyes do not close to sleep
     because they wish to see his golden feet.
     O cuckoo bird, I will make the beautiful parrot
     that I raised feeding it sweet rice and milk be your friend.
     Coo and call him, so that who measured the world will come to me.

550. Rishikesan, worshiped by the gods in all the directions,
     made me unhappy with love for him
     and the beauty of the white pearl-like smile of my red mouth
     and of my breasts was lost.
     O young cuckoo bird,
     you sleep in a beautiful place
     in a grove blooming with flowers.
     If you coo and call for him, the true one, to come to me,

     I don’t know any other way to pay you back.

551. He rests on the surging milky ocean.
     My breasts have grown out and are happy
     because they want to embrace the lord,
     but they make me sad since I have not seen him.
     O beautiful cuckoo bird, why are you hiding?
     If you coo and call and make him
     with a discus, a conch and a strong club come to me,
     you will have the good karma of doing many generous acts.

552. The clever one who is loved by all,
     shoots arrows from his bow with his strong hands.
     He and I know the promises that we made when we stayed in our home.
     O small cuckoo bird who pluck the tender shoots
     of the sweet mango tree in the grove,
     if you coo and call for Thirumāl to come here quickly,
     you will see what I will do for him with my love.

553. I have fallen in love with Sridharan
     who has the color of a green parrot.
     O cuckoo bird living in a grove that swarms with shining bees,
     give me your attention and listen.
     Either you should coo and call,
     asking him with a conch and discus to come to me,
     or you should find the golden bangles
     that I have lost and bring them to me.
     If you want to live in this grove,
     you should do one of these things.

554. I fell in love with him
     who measured the world and became his devotee,
     but he only makes me sad
     because I love him and have not seen him.
     I can’t describe the sorrow
     that the breeze and the moon give me.
     O cuckoo bird, don’t make me suffer
     staying in this grove and cooing always.
     If you don’t call today for Narayaṇan to come,
     I will chase you away from here.

555. The Paṭṭarpirān Kodai, chief of Puduvai
     where Vediyar recite with music the four Vedas
     composed ten pāsurams about how a woman
     with spear-like eyes asked a cuckoo bird
     to call for him who grew into the sky
     and measured the world to come, saying,
     “O dark cuckoo bird, coo and call my ocean-colored beloved.”
     If devotees learn these pāsurams and recite them and say,
     “Namo, Narayaṇā!” they will reach him.

Her dream of the Wedding.

556. O friend, I had a dream.
     People decorated every place with festoons
     and put out golden pots with coconuts
     to welcome Nāraṇan Nambi
     when he comes in procession
     surrounded by a thousand elephants.

557. O friend, I had a dream.
     My relatives decided the day for my wedding.
     They decorated a beautiful pandal with kamugu trees.
     Mādhavan Govindan who once took a form of a lion,
     strong as a bull, entered into the pandal—
     I saw him in my dream.

558. O friend, I had a dream.
     Indra and the other gods came together,
     asked for me to be his bride
     and made all the arrangements.
     My sister-in-law Durgā tied a silk marriage sari on me
     and decorated me with fragrant garlands.

559. O friend, I had a dream.
     The Brahmin brought divine water
     from different directions and sprinkled it all over.
     They sang songs of purification.
     The priest tied the string bound together with flowers
     on my hand and on the divine groom’s hand to protect us.

560. O friend, I had a dream.
     Dancing women carried shining lights and kalasams
     and went in front of him and welcomed him.
     The king of Madura walked touching the earth
     as the earth shook.

561. O friend, I had a dream.
     The drums were beaten, the lined conches were blown
     and my bridegroom, Nambi Madhusūdanan,
     came and held my hand
     under the pandal that was decorated
     with hanging strings of pearl garlands.

562. Skilled Vediyars recited the Vedas,
     and chanted mantras.
     They made a likeness of the sun
     with green naṇal grass.
     He is strong as an angry elephant
     and he held my hand and we circled the fire.

563. O friend, I had a dream.
     He is the refuge for this birth
     and the fourteen future births.
     He, our king Narayaṇan Nambi held my feet
     with his divine, perfect fingers
     and placed them on the grinding stone.

564. O friend, I had a dream.
     My brothers with shining faces and bows
     came and, standing before us,
     kindled the fire and made it bright.
     They joined my hand with the hand of Achuthan
     who once took the form of a lion,
     and they poured popped rice on it.

565. O friend, I had a dream.
     Adorned with kumkum
     and smeared with cool sandal paste,
     I went with him on an elephant in procession
     circling all the auspicious streets
     as people sprinkled turmeric water on us.

566. The chief of Villipputhur Kodai,
     praised by the family of Veyars,
     composed a garland of ten Tamil pāsurams
     that describe the dream of a woman
     and what she said about her marriage with the cowherd.
     If devotees learn and recite these ten pāsurams
     they will give birth to many good children and find happiness.

Praising the conch

567. O white conch, born in the ocean,
     tell me—I ask you anxiously.
     He puts you in his mouth to make the sound of victory.
     What is the taste and the fragrance
     of the mouth of Mādhavan
     who broke the tusks of the elephant?
     Does it have the fragrance of camphor?
     Does it have the fragrance of a lotus flower?
     Does his beautiful red coral mouth taste sweet?

568. O beautiful conch born in the ocean,
     you entered the body of the Asuran Panchajanya
     and now you rest in his hand,
     making the sound of victory
     when he conquers the evil Asurans.

569. You are a wonderful conch!
     Like the full moon that rises in the autumn
     from behind the large mountain,
     you stay in the hands of Vasudevan
     the king of northern Madura.

570. O beautiful large valampuri conch,
     you are like the moon even though you are not in the sky.
     As you stay in the hand of Damodaran,
     do you say any mantras in his ears?
     Even Indra the king of gods
     does not have the fortune that you have.

571. O Panchajanya!
     Others were born along with you in the ocean,
     but they do not receive the respect that you do.
     You drink constantly the nectar from the mouth
     of the king Madhusūdanan.

572. O Valampuri conch,
     you have not gone to the Ganges
     or on other pilgrimages to bathe,
     yet you rest in the hands of lovely-eyed Thirumāl
     who destroyed the Asurans
     when they came as marudam trees.
     You have the good fortune of plunging
     into the divine water that comes from his mouth.

573. O king of conches,
     like a swan that stays on a fresh red lotus flower and drinks honey,
     you are held in the beautiful hands of Vasudevan
     with a dark body and red eyes and you stay with him.
     Your good fortune is truly wonderful.

574. O Panchajanya, your food is the nectar
     that springs from the mouth of him
     who measured the world
     and you sleep in the hands of the ocean-colored god.
     You make women jealous
     and they complain loudly about your good luck,

575. O fortunate conch
     who drink nectar from the mouth of Madhavan
     as if you were drinking honey,
     won’t his sixteen thousand wives be angry
     when they see you with him
     drinking the nectar that all others want to drink?

576. Paṭṭarpirān Kodai, famed in rich Puduvai,
     composed ten Tamil pāsurams
     describing Padmanābhan with the Panchajanya conch.
     If devotees learn and recite these pāsurams
     they will be near him..

The cloud messenger

577. O clouds, you look like a blue blanket covering the sky.
     Thirumāl, of Venkaṭam hill where clear water flows
     has not come to see me
     and the tears from my eyes fall on my breasts.
     I am tired and I am only a woman.
     Is it right that he should destroy my pride like this?

578. O dark clouds pouring your rain like rich pearls,
     do you have any message from the god of Venkaṭam,
     the generous one colored as dark as night?
     My love for him burns me like fire.
     If in the middle of the night
     the breeze comes and hurts me,
     how will I survive?

579. O clouds, you are generous
     and give rain to the earth.
     My shining beauty, bangles, mind and sleep
     have all gone, taking my pride with them.
     I survive only by singing the divine qualities of Govindan,
     the lord of Thiruvenkaṭam where cool waterfalls flow.

580. O shining clouds with lightning,
     he is the lord of Thiruvenkaṭam
     with the goddess Lakshmi on his handsome chest.
     Can you tell him that my breasts desire
     every day to embrace his golden chest?

581. O dark clouds, rising in the sky and spreading everywhere,
     you pour rain in Thiruvenkaṭam
     and make the flowers bloom and drip honey.
     If you would go to him to bring back my bangles
     that he has taken away,
     tell him who split open the body of Hiraṇyan with his sharp claws,
     how much I love him and suffer.

582. O cool clouds,
     you take water from the ocean,
     rise to the sky and pour rain everywhere
     in Thiruvenkaṭam of Thirumāl
     who took the land from Mahābali.
     Like insects that enter into a vilam fruit and eat it,
     Nāraṇan has entered into my heart and made me suffer.
     Go and tell him how much I love him.

583. O cool clouds floating on the hills of Thiruvenkaṭam
     of the lovely-eyed Thirumāl
     who churned the milky ocean filled with conches,
     I bow to his feet and ask him for one thing.
     Only if he comes one day and embraces me
     smearing kumkum paste on my breasts
     will I be able to survive.
     Go tell him this.

584. O clouds that rise in the rainy season
     in the Thiruvenkaṭam hills,
     I fall down like the old leaves of the erukkam plants
     when raindrops fall on them
     and recite the names of him
     who went to the battlefield and fought for the Pāndavas.
     Will he come one day and talk to me?

585. O huge clouds rising like rutting elephants,
     you think Thiruvenkaṭam is your place and live there.
     What does he, resting on the snake bed, wish to tell me?
     The people of the world may say,
     “He doesn’t understand that she thinks that he is her refuge
     and he hurts her, as beautiful as a vine.”

586. Vishṇuchithan Kodai, the chief of flourishing Puduvai,
     composed ten Tamil pāsurams
     about how a girl with a beautiful forehead
     asks the clouds to go as messengers
     and tell how she suffers from love
     for him who rests on the snake bed.
     If devotees learn these pāsurams and keep them in their minds
     they will become his devotees.

The love of a girl for the lord

587. O velvet mites colored like red sinduram powder,
     and flying everywhere in the groves of Thirumālirunjolai,
     I am caught in my love for the one with handsome arms
     who churned the milky ocean with Mandara mountain
     and took its sweet nectar.
     It is like a net. Will I survive this sorrow?

588. O friend, the mullai flowers on the vines in the forest
     filled with blossoms laugh at me in Thirumālirunjolai
     where elephants fight with each other and play.
     The vines that grow in the rainy season
     bloom as if to say, “You will not survive!”
     To whom can I tell the pain that his garland gives me?

589. O beautiful karuvilai flowers! Kāyām flowers!
     You have the color of the lord
     Tell me how I can survive.
     Is it right that strong-armed Nambi of Thirumālirunjolai
     who is always playing
     should come into our house and steal my bangles?

590. O cuckoo birds in the flourishing groves!
     Peacocks! Beautiful karuvilai blossoms!
     Fresh kala fruits! Colorful fragrant kāyām flowers!
     You are my five most powerful enemies.
     Why must you have the color of the dear lord
     of beautiful Thirumālirunjolai?
     Is it to make me sad with love and hurt me?

591. O swarm of bees,
     you have the divine color of the dark cloud-colored lord
     with beautiful eyes
     who stays in Thirumālirunjolai
     surrounded with flourishing flowers.
     O abundant, beautiful mountain springs!
     O lovely lotus flowers!
     Tell me, who can be my refuge?

592. I made a hundred pots of butter
     for Nambi of Thirumālirunjolai
     surrounded with fragrant groves.
     I told him I will fill all the hundred pots
     with sweet pongal for him.
     He grows more and more beautiful.
     Do you think he will come and eat?

593. If the dear lord of Thirumālirunjolai
     where a fragrant breeze blows
     enters my heart and stays there,
     I will make a hundred thousand pots of butter
     and sweet pongal and give them to him.
     If he comes today and eats,
     I will give him all these pots and serve him.

594. A flock of black sparrows wakes up in the morning,
     welcomes Thirumāl and sings the raga maruḷ.
     Is it true that they sing that raga to wake him up?
     They sing as if they were repeating the names of
     him who stays in Thirumālirunjolai,
     the lord of Dwarapathi who sleeps on a banyan leaf,
     but he does not come to me.

595. I seem to hang down like the golden flowers
     that sway on the branches of kondrai trees
     in Thirumālirunjolai surrounded by groves
     where kongu flowers bloom.
     When will I hear the sound of the conch
     that he blows with his lotus mouth,
     and the sound of his Sarngam bow that shoots arrows?

596. Vishṇuchithan the chief of Villiputhur
     with a garland swarming with bees
     composed ten lovely Tamil pāsurams
     praising the beautiful lord of Thirumālirunjolai
     where the Silampāṛu river flows
     bringing sandalwood, akil wood
     and throwing them up on its banks.
     If devotees learn and recite these ten lovely pāsurams
     they will join the feet of Thirumāl.

Flowers blooming in the rainy season

597. O flowers that bloom in the monsoon,
     did the dark ocean-colored god
     send you as warriors to fight with me?
     Where did he go? To whom can I complain?
     I cannot fight with my heart
     that wants his beautiful thulasi garland.

598. O thondri flowers blooming high,
     do not grow to the sky
     and burn me like the brightness of the discus
     that is in the hand of him, the ancient god
     praised by the Vedas.
     Take me to the group of the cowherds where he is.

599. O kovai vine, you are like my mother!
     Don’t take my life, ripening with your sweet round fruits
     that remind me of his dark color.
     I am afraid of your lovely red color.
     Pitiful, I say two things that are opposite.
     I say I will not live without him,
     yet I am alive without him now
     and say that I want to be with him.
     I am shameless like two-tongued Adisesha
     on whom the lord rests.

600. O mullai vine, you are like a young girl.
     Don’t hurt me with your smile
     as you shine like the discus of the lord.
     I go to you for refuge—please show me your love.
     The young lord who cut off Surpanakha’s nose
     promised he would never be apart from me.
     If his promise is false,
     it would be better if I had not been born.

601. O cuckoo birds, you sing beautifully!
     What is this song you are singing?
     Come here and sing only
     if the lord of the beautiful Venkaṭa hills
     gives me his love and allows me to survive.
     If the god with an eagle flag comes,
     gives his grace and embraces me,
     he can also listen to your songs.

602. O flock of peacocks,
     you have the beautiful color of the dear lord Kaṇṇan
     and move gracefully
     as if you had studied long to learn to dance.
     I bow to your feet.
     Do you see the sorrow of love that the dear god
     resting eternally on Adisesha on the ocean
     has given me?

603. O lovely peacocks,
     you dance beautifully spreading your wings.
     I am pitiful and have no interest in seeing you dance.
     Govindan, who dances the kudavai kuthu on a pot,
     has taken all my feelings with him.
     It is cruel of you to dance happily,
     reminding me of him and giving me pain.

604. O cloud, O cloud!
     The thought that he has not entered my heart makes me suffer.
     Like wax covered with sand that melts and pours down,
     my love for him pours out.
     Won’t you make the beautiful god of Venkaṭa hills
     enter into my heart and embrace me?

605. O milky ocean, O milky ocean!
     Māyavan churned you and took the nectar from you.
     He entered my heart, made me suffer and took my life away.
     Will you go to him who rests on the snake bed
     and tell him how I suffer for his love?

606. O dear friend, our highest lord is divine but we are small.
     He is wonderful and he rests on Adisesha, his snake bed.
     What can we do for him?
     Yet if Vishṇuchithan, the chief of Villiputhur,
     summons his generous god by composing beautiful pāsurams,
     and makes him come, we may be able to see him.

The love of a girl for the lord of Srirangam

607. O friends adorned with precious jewels,
     aren’t the bangles that I wear on my hands
     as precious as the conch that he carries in his hand?
     Won’t the lord of Srirangam
     resting on the fiery-faced snake look at me?
     It is very hard for me, very hard.

608. O lovely women,
     the sweet nectar-like lord of Srirangam
     with his beautiful hair, mouth and eyes
     and a lovely lotus on his navel with Nānmuhan on it
     made my bangles loosen and fall.
     Did he take them so he could wear them?

609. With his scepter my dear lord of Srirangam
     rules the world surrounded by roaring oceans
     and the world of the sky, keeping trouble away from them.
     Would my bangles that he has made loose
     help him remove all the troubles of the world
     and keep it prosperous?

610. Vamanan, the divine god of Srirangam
     filled with beautiful palaces and walls,
     went to Mahābali in ancient times as a sage,
     made him pour water on his hands,
     cheated him and took his lands.
     Wasn’t that enough for him?
     If he wants my bangles also can’t he come to my street
     and ask for them?

611. The lord who rests on the snake bed
     in Srirangam where good people live
     went to Mahābali as the cheating Vāmanan
     and made him give him his land
     by pouring water on his golden hands
     and measured all the worlds and the sky.
     We are poor and have little.
     It seems he wants to take the little things
     that we have in our hands.

612. He is the beloved god of Srirangam
     where the Kaveri river flows
     carrying riches from everywhere and nourishing the fields.
     He is the inner meaning of the four Vedas
     and cannot be reached by anyone, high or low.
     He already stole my bangles
     and now he has stolen my heart.

613. When he had the form of Rāma,
     the divine god of Srirangam
     surrounded by strong walls
     suffered as he thought of his wife Sita.
     He didn’t eat or sleep when he was without her
     and he made a bridge over the ocean
     to bring her back from Lanka.
     We are separated from him,
     but he doesn’t worry about us
     and thinks only of making himself happy.

614. He, the bright lord, took the form of an unclean pig
     in ancient times, split open the ground
     and rescued the earth goddess
     when an Asuran hid her in the underworld.
     Even if I don’t want to think of the promises
     that the beautiful shining god of Srirangam made to me,
     I cannot forget them.

615. When Sisupalan wanted to marry Rukmini,
     after all the arrangements had made,
     Kannan fought him, took Rukmini with him and married her.
     Sriranganathan, the lord of Srirangam,
     will help me as he helped Rukmani.

616. Vishṇuchithan composed pāsurams
     describing the love between Kaṇṇan and the cowherd women.
     They said, “the lord says, ‘I love those who love me,’
     but though we love him he does not love us.
     He lies to us, but how can we prove it?”

617. She tells her relatives, “You don’t understand
     that I love only Mādhavan whom no one can know.
     If you say you will make me marry someone else
     you’re just talking like someone who is dumb and deaf.
     He, the Nambi, left his birth mother
     and was raised by Yashoda, his other mother.
     Take me near his Madurai and leave me there
     before he goes to the battlefield to fight with the wrestlers.”

618. She says, “You, my relatives,
     should not be ashamed that I love him.
     All the neighbors know about our love.
     Don’t try to make me the person I was before.
     I have changed, I am in love with Kaṇṇan.
     If you really want to save me,
     take me to the cowherd village.
     I will only survive if I see the Māyan
     who measured the world as a dwarf.”

619. She says to her relatives,
     “When people know that I went with Kaṇṇan
     and they blame you saying,
     ‘She left her father, mother and her dear relatives
     and went away with someone,’
     you will be hurt and you won’t be able
     to avoid the disgrace that comes to you.
     Kaṇṇan, the naughty son of Nandagopālan,
     plays with the cowherd girls
     and does many mischievous things.
     Take me to the doorstep of Nandagopalan
     and leave me there at midnight.
     Māyavan comes to me often and stands before me.”

620. Her breasts say,
     “We will not look at the face of others,
     only of him with a discus in his beautiful hand.”
     They are covered with a fine sari
     and become shy if they see common people.
     They won’t even look at the doorsteps of others,
     only the house of Govindan.
     I don’t want to live here.
     Take me to the banks of the Yamuna river and leave me there.”

621. She says, “O mothers,
     no one understand how much the love
     that I have for him hurts me.
     It will go away only if the dark ocean-colored god
     embraces me with his arms.
     Take me to the pond and leave me on the banks
     where he climbed the kadamba tree,
     jumped into the pond and danced on Kālingan
     as if he were dancing on a battlefield.”

622. She says, “The cool clouds of the rainy season,
     the karuviḷai flowers, the kāyām blossoms,
     and the lotus flowers all attract me and tell me,
     ‘Go to Rishikeshan’s place.
     He is sweating, hungry, feels weak and wants food,
     and he is looking for the wives of the rishis
     to bring him something to eat.’
     Take me to where he waits for food
     and leave me there.”

623. She says, “I am growing pallid,
     my mind is confused and I have no sense of shame.
     My mouth is becoming pale,
     I don’t want to eat or sleep and I am growing thin.
     If the god colored like the roaring ocean
     puts on me his cool thulasi garland,
     all these problems will go away.
     Take me to the banyan tree
     where Balarāman conquered the Asuran Pilamban
     and leave me there.”

624. She says, “He grazed the calves,
     living among the families of cowherds in the forest,
     and he was tied to the mortar by Yashoda.
     O poor mothers, don’t gossip about these things.
     Take me near Govardhana mountain
     that he carried as a victorious umbrella
     to stop the rain and protect the cows.
     Don’t get together and argue
     about what you have heard from others,
     don’t argue with each other.”

625. She says, “My parrot in its cage
     always says, ‘Govinda, Govinda!’
     If I am angry at it and don’t feed it,
     it calls him loudly and says,
     ‘O lord, you have measured the world!’
     If I leave home and go to his place,
     people will blame you
     and my relatives and you will be ashamed.
     Take me to Dwarapathi filled with high palaces
     and leave me there.”

626. Vishṇuchithan Kodai, the chief of Puduvai
     filled with shining golden palaces
     composed a garland of beautiful pāsurams with music
     how a beloved with long hair
     tells her relatives her firm decision to join Kaṇṇan
     and she asks them to take her on a pilgrimage
     from Madurai to Dwarapathi and leave her with him.
     If devotees learn and recite these ten pāsurams
     they will reach Vaikuṇṭam.

The love sickness of a girl

627. She says, “I love the dark Kaṇṇan
     and I long to see him and suffer.
     O mothers, your gossip is like pouring tamarind juice on a wound.
     The dear lord does not know how this girl suffers.
     Bring the colorful silk cloth that decorates his waist
     and use it to fan me and make me cool.”

628. She says, “I fell into the love-net of the highest lord
     who rested on the soft banyan leaf as a baby.
     Don’t gossip uselessly as if you were piercing someone with a spear.
     He is a cowherd and grazes the cows holding a stick,
     and he danced on a pot in Kuḍanthai.
     Bring the cool thulasi garland of the dark-colored Kaṇṇan
     to decorate my soft curly hair.”

629.She says, “He killed Kamsan with his strong bow.
The glances from the corners of his eyes go through my heart
like sharp spears and make me weak and hurt,
but he doesn’t tell me, “Don’t worry!”
O mothers, if that matchless lord gives the garland
from his chest and doesn’t cheat me,
bring it and spread it on my chest.”

630. She says, “He is as sweet as nectar,
     the dark bull who stole butter and milk
     from the cowherd women
     has made me weak with love for him and I am heartbroken.
     Who is there to relieve this sorrow?
     If you bring the water that springs from his the nectar-like mouth,
     and feed that to me, the weakness of my body
     and my love sickness will go away.”

631. She says, “Even when people weep, and even if they worship him,
     he does not come before them and say, “Don’t be afraid!”
     He, the matchless Neḍumāl, came, embraced me, entered my heart,
     and now seems to follow me everywhere without ever leaving.
     Sprinkle the water on my face
     that comes from the holes of his flute
     as he plays it walking behind his cows in the grove.”

632. She says, “This world is unfair.
     Thirumāl, the son of Nandagopan,
     makes me suffer as if I were crushed
     beneath the feet of a bull.
     I can’t even move.
     Bring the dust from where he has walked,
     smear it on me, and I will survive."

633. She says, " Carrying a victorious eagle flag,
     he rules the world and all obey him.
     Yashoda raised him but she only made him
     like an unripe, bitter fruit.
     If he embraces tightly my faultless breasts with his young strong arms,
     my faults will go away and I will be happy.”

634. She says, “I melt in my heart for him
     who carried Govardhana mountain and I suffer.
     He doesn’t even care whether I’m alive or not.
     If I see that mischievous one who stole my heart,
     I will take my useless breasts and throw them on his chest.
     Perhaps that will make my fire-like anger cool.”

635. She says, “If I cannot serve Govindan in this birth,
     making my breasts happy,
     what is the use of doing tapas in the future?
     If he embraces me with his chest it would be good,
     or if he looks at me and tells me the truth to my face,
     saying, “I don’t want you, goodbye!” it would also be good.
     If he doesn’t want me what is the use of waiting
     without knowing what he wants?
     Isn’t it better if he tells me the truth?”

636. The chief of Villiputhur, Vishṇuchithan Kodai,
     composed pāsurams about how a woman
     with eyebrows more lovely than bows
     loved the dear Kaṇṇan, the bright light of the cowherd village,
     after he gave her pangs of love.
     If devotees learn these pāsurams and worship him
     they will not suffer in the ocean of sorrow.

Devotees seeing Kaṇṇan in Brindavan.

637. “Playing like a young calf,
     he makes the cows crazy
     as he goes behind his brother Baladevan.
     Did you see that dark bull-like one?”
     “We saw him grazing the cows and giving them water.
     He loves them and plays with them in Brindavan.”

638. “Did you see Govardhanan
     stealing the butter, eating it and smelling of ghee?
     He left me and went to the cowherd village.”
     “We saw the dark one adorned with garlands made of forest flowers.
     He looked like the clouds shining with lightning
     in Brindavan as he played there.”

639. “Did you see Nambi Thirumāl when he was born as a child?
     He bewitched all the young girls, telling unbelievable lies.
     Did you see him coming here?”
     “We saw him flying on Garuḍa
     shielded by its wings from the heat in Brindavan.”

640. “He attracted me with his dark beautiful lotus eyes,
     tied me to him with his love, pulled me and played with me.
     Did you see him?”
     “We saw him. He was like a baby elephant
     covered with a cloth decorated with pearls.
     We saw him sweating and playing in Brindavan.”

641. “Did you see Madhavan, my lord, my jewel?
     He is like a pig that has been caught in a net and escaped.
     Has no one seen him? Doesn’t he want to show himself to anyone?”
     “We saw him. He was like a dark baby cloud
     wearing golden clothes as he came on the street in Brindavan.”

642. “Did you see the naughty one,
     his beautiful eyebrows bending like his Sarngam bow?
     He doesn’t have any compassion for the young girls
     who love him and is always bothering them.
     He doesn’t know how to get along with others.”
     “We saw the dark one with a fair face.
     He looked like the bright sun rising from behind a hill.
     We saw him in Brindavan.”

643. “Did you see him, beautiful and dark as a cloud?
     Is his mind as dark as his body?
     He makes many promises to girls but doesn’t keep them.
     Doesn’t he have any compassion?”
     “We saw him. He was bright as the sky filled with stars
     when he came with a big crowd in Brindavan.”

644. “Did you see generous Thirumāl
     carrying a white conch and a discus
     and adorned with golden clothes?”
     “We saw him as his lovely fragrant hair fell on his large arms
     while he played in Brindavan.”

645. “He created Nānmuhan on a beautiful lotus
     growing from his navel
     so that Nānmuhan could create the whole world.
     Did you see the faultless lord who created this world and plays in it?”
     “We saw the lord returning from fighting
     after killing the Rakshasa Thenugan
     and the elephant Kuvalayabeeḍam in the forest. We saw him in Brindavan.”

646. Vishṇuchithan Kodai composed pāsurams
     about how the people saw the highest lord in Brindavan
     who gave his grace to Gajendra the elephant
     and saved him from the crocodile.
     If devotees keep these pāsurams in their minds as a cure
     they will live under the divine feet of the lord without leaving him.

## 04. Perumāl Thirumozhi by Kulasekharazhvar (647 -751)

When will I see my god, the lord of Thiruvarangam

647. When will the day come when my two eyes see
     the dark god shining like a komalam jewel,
     resting on his beautiful white shining bed, the king of snakes
     with a thousand shining foreheads
     that remove the darkness with their bright diamonds,
     as the god’s feet are washed
     by the clear water of the Ponni river flowing
     in the Thiruppadi of Srirangam.
     When will my two eyes see him and feel happy?

648. When will the day come
     that I can praise wholeheartedly our god, Māyon,
     decorated with fragrant garlands
     and dark as a kāyām flower?
     He stays in my mind like a pillar
     and rests on the water in Srirangam
     on the fiery snake that has a curving body
     and a thousand heads that spit fire
     and that looks like a canopy made of fresh flowers.
     When will I see him?

649. When will the day come
     when I can place flowers under his feet
     and approach him with his devotees
     as the good Nānmuhan with four faces
     and eight beautiful eyes praises him with his four tongues?
     Our dear lord shining like pure gold
     keeps Nānmuhan on a lovely lotus on his navel
     while he sleeps on the beautiful snake bed in Srirangam.
     When will I see him?

650. When will the day come when I fold my hands
     and worship the ocean-colored lord,
     sprinkling pure fresh flowers with my hands
     for him who split open the beak of the bird?
     He is strong as a bull among the cowherds,
     the king of the gods in the sky,
     and is sweet Tamil and Sanskrit poetry.
     The lord who carried Govardhana mountain to save the cows
     rests on a snake bed in Srirangam
     where sages without attachment
     praise him with their tongues.
     When will I see him?

651. When will the day come
     when I worship, bowing my head,
     and see the dear sapphire-colored lord
     decorated with garlands
     resting on the snake bed in Srirangam
     that is rich and filled with palaces and beautiful porches?
     He is praised by Narada and the rishi Thumburu there ,
     playing sweet matchless music on their yāzhs
     and Nānmuhan, adorned with beautiful flowers,
     worships him constantly with the incomparable ancient Vedas.
     When will I see him?

652. When will the day come when I worship
     melting in my heart and see the divine face
     bright as the moon and the lotus eyes of him
     resting on the snake bed in beautiful Srirangam
     surrounded by groves blooming with fragrant flowers?
     Nānmuhan who stays on a beautiful lotus,
     Shiva, Indira and all other gods, Apsarases
     and wise sages join together and sprinkle flowers
     in all the directions and worship him there.
     When will I see him?

653. When will the day come
     when my eyes, filled with tears,
     see the dark-colored Māyon resting on the snake bed
     in beautiful Srirangam on the Kaveri river?
     He changes the evil hearts of people to good,
     helps them control their five senses
     and relieves them of the burden of their troubles and sickness,
     making them his devotees
     so they can follow the ways of dharma in their minds.
     When will I see him?

654. When will the day come
     when I who have done bad karma
     can see and join happily the god
     resting on the snake bed in Srirangam
     surrounded by groves and flourishing fields where fish frolic?
     He protects the world with his long bent bow, conch,
     sword, his discus that destroys his enemies
     and his vehicle Garuḍa that flies in the sky.
     When will I see him?

655. When will the day come
     when I worship, jumping and rolling on the ground,
     and see the dear lord with a discus
     resting on the snake bed in Srirangam
     where the beating of beautiful drums
     is like the sound of the ocean
     and devotees, joined together in a group
     and loving the lord in their minds,
     sing devotional songs,
     shed tears like rain and praise him happily?
     When will I see him?

656. When will the day come
     when I see the group of happy devotees
     and join them and am joyful
     in the divine temple of beautiful Srirangam
     where Thirumāl rests facing south
     giving his grace so that the wide sky pours rain,
     the gods in the heavens are saved,
     the earth flourishes,
     the people of the world survive,
     the sorrow of people disappears,
     good health increases in the world
     and his devotees live happily?
     When will I see him?

657. Kulasekaran, the king with a strong army
     who carries a victorious shining sword
     and sits under a royal umbrella,
     composed ten Tamil pāsurams praising the lord of Srirangam
     who rests on the snake bed on Ponni river.
     If devotees learn these pāsurams well and recite them
     they will stay under the feet of Nāraṇan
     who showers goodness to all.

Lord of Southern Thiruvarangam.

658. If I am able to see and join
     the happy group of true devotees
     who call, sing and dance, enthralled,
     and think only of Rangan of south Srirangam,
     as sweet as honey, hard to find,
     decorated with garlands that never wither,
     with the goddess of wealth seated on his chest,
     that will be the purpose of this birth.

659. If I can see and join the devotees
     who praise him saying,
     “O Ranga, you embrace Lakshmi,
     seated on a lotus with blooming buds.
     You cut down the tall mango tree with your shining sword
     and you grazed the cows,”
     and if I can think only of him and call him,
     dance, sing and worship the dust on his devotees’ feet,
     why should I desire to bathe in the Ganges?

660. His devotees sing and praise him, saying,
     “You conquered the bulls.
     Taking the form of a boar you split the earth.
     As Rāma you conquered your enemy Ravaṇan.
     You came as a dwarf and measured the earth.”
     When I see your devotees as they make the front yard
     of Rangan’s temple wet with their tears
     that are like the flow of abundant water of the rich Ponni river,
     I will put on my head the good dust
     that is beneath their divine feet.

661. My heart praises and worships the divine feet
     of the devotees who call, worship, melt and praise him, saying,
     “Nāraṇa, you are our dear god.
     You were not afraid that Yashoda might punish you
     when she saw you stealing and eating the butter,
     good yogurt and milk.
     You stood there bravely and tapped your arms in front of her.”

662. He has the color of a dark cloud
     and carries a heroic bow.
     He killed seven evil bulls, breaking their horns,
     and he danced on the snake Kalingan.
     My mind trembles
     when I think of the devotees
     whose bodies shake when they worship Rangan
     of southern Srirangam
     surrounded by strong shining stone walls.

663. In all my births, my heart worships and praises
     those devotees who love and serve Rangan
     and wander everywhere to show
     the faultless good path to sinners
     who do not have devotion
     and do not worship the divine feet of Thirumāl,
     the lord without beginning or end,
     the wonderful one, the dear god of the gods.

664. My heart loves and praises
     the feet of the devotees
     who love Thirumāl and shed tears,
     melting in their hearts as they worship him,
     a bright wonderful light,
     Rangan of Srirangam, with a red mouth,
     teeth like pearls, a body dark as a cloud
     and a chest decorated with Thulasi garlands.

665. He has lovely flower-like eyes
     and his divine mountain-like chest
     wears a fragrant thulasi garland
     swarming with bees and dripping with honey
     as he rests on the milky ocean.
     My heart falls in love with those devotees
     who are fascinated by him
     and wander, sing, dance and worship Rangan, our dear lord.

666. The devotees of Rangan, my lord and father,
     as they shed tears of joy,
     tremble, long for him in their hearts
     worship, dance and sing.
     They seem mad but they are not.
     It is those people who do not worship, dance, sing
     and praise him who are truly mad.

667. Kulasekharan, the king of Uraiyur,
     the lord of Kuḍal Nagar and the protector of Kolli hills
     composed sweet Tamil pāsurams on Rangan,
     the beloved of Lakshmi.
     He abides in the minds of his true devotees
     if they think only of him and serve him as his slaves.
     If they learn and recite these pāsurams
     they will become the devotees of his devotees.

668. All the people of this world
     think that the false life on this earth is true.
     I do not want to join them.
     I call you, “O dear father, Ranga!”
     and suffer falling in love with you, my Thirumāl.

669. The people of the world
     love women with beautiful waists as thin as threads.
     I do not want to join them.
     I call you, saying, “O Ranga who sleep on the banyan leaf,
     my love increases for you, the Thirumāl,
     and I suffer with love for you.”

670. The people of this world fall in love when Kāma shoots
     his mischievous arrows from his beautiful bow.
     I do not want to join them.
     My Rangan’s chest is adorned with garlands
     and he is my good Nāraṇan who rests on Adisesha.
     He saves his devotees from falling into hell.
     I am crazy for him.

671. The people of this world
     crave food and clothes and search for them.
     I do not want to join them.
     See, he drank milk from the breasts of the cruel devil Putanā,
     and I am crazy for Rangan, the lord of the world.

672. I do not join with those who do evil things
     when there are good things to do.
     I am crazy for the ancient one, the cowherd, Rangan,
     the beloved husband of innocent Lakshmi
     seated on a beautiful lotus.

673. I will not join people
     if they are not the devotees of the highest. .
     I do not think the life of any other god in the sky is best.
     For all my seven births I want to be a crazy devotee
     of my dear god of the gods of divine Srirangam.

674. My mind shuns the thought of joining anyone
     who is not your devotee.
     I call you, “O Thirumāl with beautiful eyes,
     you are my Rangan, you are my lord!”
     and I become crazy for you, my beloved. .

675. Everyone in the world looks crazy to me.
     and I am also crazy.
     I tell this to all and call you,
     “O cowherd, Ranga!”
     and I become crazy for you, my dear lord.

676. The king of Kongu country Kulasekharar
     thinks only of the feet of him who rests on the ocean,
     and he composed pāsurams about the devotees
     who are crazy for the lord.
     If devotees recite the words of Kulasekaran
     they will have no troubles in their lives.
     Lord of Thiruvenkaṭam hills

677. I do not want this body that is a bundle of flesh.
     I want to be born as a kurugu bird that lives
     on the branches of the trees in Thiruvenkaṭam
     of him with a conch in his left hand
     who conquered seven strong bulls.
     I want only to be his slave.

678. I do not want endless wealth or status,
     I don’t want to be surrounded by heavenly women
     or have the joy of ruling the sky
     and a kingdom on the earth.
     I want to be born as a fish in a spring
     in Thiruvenkaṭam filled with groves
     flourishing with flowers that drip honey.

679. He carries a shining round discus.
     Shiva with matted hair, Nanmuhan and Indra
     could not enter the divine entrance of Vaikuṇṭam
     even when they approached it,
     but I will enter holding the golden plate
     that the king of Thiruvenkaṭam ate from.

680. Māyon rests on the cool milky ocean
     where fertile coral-creepers float.
     I would have the good fortune of blooming
     as a shenbaga flower in Thiruvenkaṭam hills
     where a swarm of bees sings and praises him.
     I will see the feet of Māyon, decorated with anklets,
     as he stays in the Thiruvenkaṭam hills.

681. I do not want to sit
     on the neck of a rutting elephant that frightens everyone
     and know the joy of riding it.
     I want to have the good fortune
     of standing as a pole in the beautiful Venkaṭam hills
     of our beloved lord.

682. I do not want to enjoy
     the dance and songs of heavenly women
     like Urvasi and Menaka with waists as thin as lightning.
     I want to have the good fortune of being a golden peak
     in the Thiruvenkaṭam hills
     where bees swarm and sing “tenna, tenna.”

683. I do not want the luxury of sitting
     under a white royal umbrella
     bright as the moon that rules the sky.
     I want to be a forest river that flows
     from the Thiruvenkaṭam hills surrounded with groves
     blooming with flowers that drip honey.

684. I want to be a path on the Thiruvenkaṭam hills
     surrounded by cool fragrant groves,
     where he stays who is the meaning of the Vedas
     and who helped Nanmuhan, Indra
     and Shiva with the crescent moon in his matted hair
     when they performed sacrifices.

685. O, Thirumāl, you take away the bad karma of all.
     You are the highest ! You stay in the Thiruvenkaṭam hills.
     Devotees, the gods in the sky and Apsarases
     stand at the entrance of your temple to see you.
     I will become a step at the threshold of your temple
     and I will see your coral mouth.

686. Even if I were to become the king
     of the world of the gods,
     rule it beneath a sole umbrella
     and enjoy the waist of Urvasi,
     decorated with beautiful golden ornaments,
     I would not want it.
     I want to become anything on the golden hills
     of Thiruvenkaṭam of my lord. .

687. Kulasekharan with a sharp spear
     that kills his enemies worshiped the lord
     of Thiruvenkaṭam hills with cool and lovely slopes
     and, wishing to see his golden shining feet,
     composed pāsurams praising him.
     If Tamil scholars learn well these pāsurams of Kulasekaran
     they will become his good devotees.

Lord of Vitruvakkoṭṭam.

688. You are the beloved lord of Vitruvakkoṭṭam
     surrounded with fragrant blooming groves.
     Do not give me troubles—
     I have no refuge but you.
     I am like a crying child thinking of the love
     of the mother who gave birth to it
     even if she goes away when she is angry.

689. A girl of a good family knows no one
     except the husband who married her
     even if he treats her so badly
     that those who see hate him.
     I am like her. You are my father,
     the lord of Vitruvakkoṭṭam
     surrounded by forts that touch the sky.
     Even if you are like a husband and possess me,
     I will praise only your feet decorated with sounding anklets.

690. You are my father, the god of Vitruvakkoṭṭam
     surrounded by fertile fields where fish swim.
     Even if you do not look at me,
     I have no refuge except you.
     I am like those who live depending on the rule
     of a king decorated with garlands
     even if, unconcerned, he causes them much pain.

691. O my father, lord of Vitruvakkoṭṭam,
     a patient loves and does not leave a doctor
     even when he cuts him with a knife and burns him.
     I am like that patient. Even if you cause me pain
     that I must bear, I am enthralled by you.
     I am your slave and look only for your grace
     and think you are my only friend.

692. O my father, lord of Vitruvakkottam
     who conquered the strong cruel-eyed elephant,
     where can I go and be saved except beneath your feet?
     I am like a huge bird that wanders
     looking for the shore of the ocean with rolling waves
     and, unable to find it, comes back
     to the mast of a ship.

693. You are my father, the lord of Vitruvakkoṭṭam,
     where red lotuses bloom only under the hot sun
     even though the sun comes to the middle of the sky
     and burns them with its heat.
     I am like those lotuses.
     Even if you do not take away my bad karma,
     my heart only melts for your endless grace.

694. O my father, lord of Vitruvakkoṭṭam,
     even when it has not rained for a long time,
     the green crops look at the huge dark clouds
     floating in the sky hoping it will rain.
     I am like them. I am your slave.
     Even if my troubles will not go away,
     my heart will look only for you.

695. O my father, lord of Vitruvakkoṭṭam,
     even if all the rivers come together
     spread and flood everywhere,
     they cannot stay where they are but must join the ocean.
     I wish to join you as those rivers join the ocean.
     O virtuous one who have the color of a dark shining cloud.
     See, I have no way to find refuge
     except to come to you for your grace.

696. O my father, lord of Vitruvakkoṭṭam,
     I want only you with a shining discus bright as lightning in your hand.
     I think of you only as my wealth
     and want no other riches.
     I am your slave and I want only you.

697 Kulasekharan with a victorious spear
loved the god and composed ten good Tamil pāsurams
praising Thirumāl and saying, “You are my father,
the lord of Vitruvakkoṭṭam.
Even if you do not give me your grace
I have no other refuge than your feet.”
If devotees learn and recite these ten excellent Tamil pāsurams
of Kulasekharan they will not go to hell.

Kaṇṇan and the cowherd girls.

698. “Many of the cowherd women in this town
     decorated with fresh flowers
     say they don’t want to embrace your chest
     because you lied to them.
     I am standing on a sand dune
     on the bank of the Yamuna river
     shaking in the cold that comes after a strong rain.
     O Vasudeva, I am waiting for you to come.”

699. “You saw a lovely girl with beautiful fish-like eyes
     churning yogurt in her home near you
     and you entered her house like a thief and said,
     ‘I will also churn yogurt.’
     When the girl with long beautiful hair
     that was decorated with flowers swarming with bees
     saw you, her bright face sweated and her red mouth quivered.
     O Damodara, I know truly how you churn the yogurt!”

700. “You looked at one girl
     with dark hair adorned with flowers,
     you approached another girl and your heart fell for her,
     you told another girl about her,
     you told lies to another innocent girl,
     and you embraced a curly-haired young girl,
     but you are not true to any of them.
     O you who destroyed the wrestlers
     when they came as marudu trees,
     as you grow, your magic grows with you.”

701. “Even though there is nectar-like milk
     in your mother’s breast, you crawled
     and toddled to the devil Putanā,
     put your mouth to her breasts
     and drank her poisonous milk.
     Those who saw you called you crazy.
     I am here and I love you,
     but you got together with the girl
     I sent as a messenger and enjoyed her.
     Is that also one of your naughty deeds?”

702. “I saw you wearing golden silk clothes
     as you went on the street in the dark night
     with another girl with a thin lightning-like waist.
     I stood there and saw how you looked at her
     as she looked at you,
     but you were also gesturing with your hands
     to call another girl who saw you.
     Why have you left them all and returned?
     Dear one, go back to them now.”

703. “O Vasudeva with strong heroic arms,
     did I do something to get bad karma?
     When I went to rest in the middle of the night,
     you left me on the bed alone,
     and not only that night, my dear one,
     but other nights also.
     And after you embraced young girls,
     you came back to me.
     Why did you come back and leave them?
     O dear one, get up and go to them.”

704. “O you who rest on the snake bed of Adishesha,
     we are not like the ones you knew before,
     not like those you loved
     with beautiful eyes darkened with kohl.
     Stop coming to our village and staying here.
     It is enough that we fell for you,
     looking at your beautiful clothes, divine face,
     fruit-like red lips and listening to the music of your flute.
     If we hear your lies for one day, that is enough.
     Stop saying your cheating words to attract us.
     O young one, please go away.”

705. “You asked me to come here
     but you went to the pandal blooming
     with clusters of jasmine and loved her.
     When you saw me, you muttered
     as if your heart was melting for me.
     Even though you brought a golden dress for me
     and lied that you love me before you went away,
     when you come to see me again
     I will still care for you,
     and if I see you my anger may go away.”

706. “Your chest is decorated
     with lovely, auspicious flower garlands
     and you wear peacock feathers in your hair.
     Your bright clothes are beautiful
     and your ears are adorned with a bunch of flowers.
     You played sweet music on the flute for the girls,
     with hair adorned with fragrant kongu flowers
     and flirted with them.
     Would you come and play music
     on your flute one day to enthrall us”

707. Kulasekharan, the chief of Kolli hills
     composed ten sweet Tamil pāsurams
     describing how the young cowherd girls
     fell in love with the beloved of beautiful goddess Lakshmi
     and how they expressed their wish
     to fight with him lovingly in the night.
     If devotees recite with music these ten sweet Tamil pāsurams
     of Kulasekaran, they will have no troubles in life.

Devaki's Lullaby to Krishna.

708. “You are as sweet as the sugarcane juice
     that comes from a sugarcane press, thālo.
     Your big eyes are lovely as lotuses in the water, thālo.
     Your color is like the water of the ocean, thālo.
     You are the king who killed the elephant Kuvalayābeeḍam, thālo.
     You are my son with handsome fragrant hair, thālo.
     I am more unlucky than all other mothers
     because I don’t have the good fortune
     of singing a lullaby and saying “thālo, thālo” for you.”

709. “Your lotus eyes darkened with kohl are beautiful
     as you look up and see the decorations on the cradle.
     You look like a baby cloud.
     As you bend your legs and put your fingers in your mouth,
     you look like an elephant bending its trunk and sleeping.
     O Kesava, I don’t have the good fortune
     of seeing these things when you are a baby.”

710. “Mothers from good families
     keep their children on their laps and say,
     ‘You are my dear one,
     you are the bright light of our family,
     you are like a bull that has the color of a cloud.’
     When someone asked you, ‘Who is your father?’
     you looked at Nandagopan out of the corner of your eyes
     and pointed at him with your beautiful fingers.
     Vasudevan, our chief, does not have the good fortune
     of being your father.”

711. “O Kaṇṇa, your face is like the shining full moon,
     your hands, chest and arms are strong,
     your dark hair is adorned with fresh flowers,
     your forehead is like the crescent moon
     and your eyes are like lotuses blooming in a pond.
     I do not have the fortune of seeing
     you with my eyes when you are a baby
     even though I think of myself as your mother.
     I am unlucky and I don’t have the pleasure
     of raising my child, yet still I am alive.”

712. “You kissed your father Nandagopan
     and your mother Yashoda with your beautiful lips
     as the chuṭṭi ornament on your beautiful forehead swung around.
     You put your sweet fingers into your lovely mouth
     and prattled innocently.
     When your father saw you like that
     his heart was filled with joy,
     but I did not have the good fortune of seeing those things
     or listening to your baby talk.
     Only the divine Yashoda has known that joy.”

713. “O Kaṇṇa with cool lotus eyes,
     you crawled and toddled in the cowherd village
     and you played in the red sand.
     I don’t have the good fortune of embracing you
     and covering my chest with the red sand you played in.
     When you eat your food you scatter it all over.
     I never had the good fortune of eating
     what was left over on your plate.
     Surely, my karma is bad.
     What is the use of my mother gave birth to me?”

714. “O sweet one, my lovely child, Govinda,
     babies hold on to one of their mothers’ breasts
     with their young beautiful hands
     that are as tender as shoots and drink milk.
     They look at their mother’s face and smile at them.
     I don’t have the fortune of feeding you milk like that.”

715. “You took butter with your small lotus-bud-like hands and ate it.
     When Yashoda brought a rope you were afraid she was going to hit you
     and, your beautiful mouth smeared with yogurt,
     you were scared as you looked at her and cried
     and your small red mouth trembled.
     Then you folded your hands and worshipped her
     and when she saw this, she found endless joy.”

716. “You stopped the rain with Govardhana mountain
     and protected the cows.
     You danced the beautiful kuravai dance
     and danced on a pot.
     You picked up the Rakshasas when they came as calves,
     threw them at the vilam fruit tree and killed them.
     You danced on the head of Kalingan the snake.
     I never saw how you played like this as a child—
     my heart never felt the joy of seeing these things.
     Give me your grace that I may see you play like that
     if you can do it again.”

717. “When you drank milk from the breasts of Putanā,
     the evil-hearted one, her body became withered,
     blood flowed out and her nerves were broken.
     You survived even though you drank her poisonous milk
     and gave your grace to all.
     O my father who are like a dark cloud,
     who took the life of Kamsan,
     my breasts are a burden to me and I cannot use them.
     I think I will see you one day
     and that is the only thing I am living for.
     You have a good mother, Yashoda.”

718. Kulasekharan the king of Kolli
     who bowed down with his head and worshiped Kaṇṇan
     wrote a garland of ten Tamil pāsurams
     describing how Devaki was sad not to have the fortune
     of seeing her son grow up
     who fought with Kamsan the king of Madura and killed him.
     If devotees learn and recite these fine musical Tamil pāsurams
     they will be with Naraṇan soon.

A Lullaby for Rama.

719. You, the sweet nectar

The story of Rāma—Dasharatha suffers when Rama goes to forest.

730. Dasaratha says, “You were going to become king
     as the people of this flourishing country
     bowed to your strong feet and worshipped you.
     When you were about to sit on the throne,
     O Rāma, your step-mother said,
     ‘Go and stay for a long time in the large forest.’
     I listened to the words of Kaikeyi, your mother,
     and asked you to go to the forest.
     O my dear son, that is what I did to you!”

731. Dasaratha says, “You listened to my cruel words
     and left quickly, leaving this kingdom
     with its victorious elephants, chariots and horses
     and went to the forest.
     Your lovely wife, decorated with ornaments,
     her long eyes like spears smeared with oil,
     and your younger brother Lakshmana followed you.
     How could you walk in that cruel forest?
     O our Rāma! You are my dear lord.
     What can I do?”

732. Dasaratha says, “You, with your mountain-like arms that can fight anyone,
     the son of the family of Kosalai
     whose long red-lined eyes are like murderous spears,
     know how to melt my heart.
     Before you slept on a soft bed in the palace—
     how are you going to sleep
     under the shadow of a tree in the large forest?
     How could you learn to sleep on a stone bed,
     O dark king of the dynasty of Kahustha?”

733. Dasaratha says, “Come here and go back to the forest,
     come and see me one more time before you go.
     O you who broke the bow of Shiva who rides the bull
     to marry your wife Sita
     with lovely hair decorated with flowers
     and beautiful bamboo-like arms.
     Now you are going to the wide forest
     and you make my heart suffer.
     Surely I must have done bad karma.
     My son, you are leaving,
     yet my heart does not split in two."

734. Dasaratha says, “Your soft feet will hurt
     when you walk on the gravel with stones
     as sharp as the points of the spears enemies hold,
     and they may bleed.
     Willingly you are going to the forest
     where no one wishes to go.
     The sun will be hot and hunger will cause you cruel pain.
     My son, you are going now
     because I, a sinner, listened to the evil daughter of king Kaikeyan.
     Surely I must have done bad karma. What can I do to stop you?”

735. Dasaratha says, “From now on
     I will not hear anyone lovingly calling me “amma.”
     No more will I feel the tight embrace
     of his ornamented chest on my chest.
     I cannot kiss him on his forehead,
     I will not be able to see his majestic walk
     that is like the stride of an elephant,
     I will not be able to see his lotus face anymore.
     I have lost my dear one, my son.
     Surely I have done terrible deeds, yet I am still alive.”

736. Dasaratha says, “His hair that was decorated
     with fragrant flowers is matted into jaṭa now.
     He would wear lovely, soft garments on his waist
     but now he wears orange clothes like a renunciant
     and he does not wear any ornaments.
     Is it right that my son with such handsome arms
     should go to the forest instead of me?
     O, Sumanthra, O sage Vashisṭa,
     you are learned men of the Vedas. Tell me!”

737. Dasaratha says, “O Kaikeyi,
     you have sent to the forest my divine son, as precious as gold,
     his brother Lakshmaṇa and my gentle-natured daughter-in-law
     with a waist as thin as lightning
     and words as sweet as a puvai bird’s.
     People will blame your own son Bharatha
     for what you have done
     and you are going to make me go to heaven in the sky.
     What are you going to get from all this?
     O Kaikeyi, how could you live happily in this large world?”

738. Dasaratha says, “You broke the bow
     of axe-carrying Parasurāma and destroyed his tapas.
     Without thinking how I will suffer
     and without thinking how your mother will suffer,
     you just listened to my words
     and my promise to your step-mother
     and left for the forest.
     You are my dear one.
     I wish that you could be born as my son
     for the next seven births.
     May I have that fortune,
     O king with long, strong arms.”

739. Dasaratha says, “I heard the cruel words
     of the evil Kaikeyi who followed the advice of Kuni
     and now I will leave Sumithra to suffer
     and Kosalai with hair filled with flowers that drip honey.
     You are going to the forest, leaving this rich palace happily,
     and I will leave this place
     and go to the gods’ world happily,
     O king of the dynasty of Manu.”

740. Dasharatha, adorned with garlands,
     his arms strong as mountains, suffered when his son,
     the beautiful dark Neḍumāl, went to the forest.
     Kulasekharan, the king of Kozhiyur
     who carries a sharp spear and rules under a royal umbrella
     composed ten Tamil pāsurams
     that describe the suffering of Dasharatha.
     If devotees learn these Tamil pāsurams
     they will avoid the bad paths of life.

God Rama of Thillai Chitrakuḍam.

741. Rāma, tall, with beautiful eyes,
     colored like a dark cloud,
     our dear king, our lord,
     the light that illuminates the whole world,
     stays in beautiful Ayodhya surrounded by high walls.
     Born in the dynasty of the sun,
     he brightens that royal line, and he conquered the whole sky
     and is the god of Thiruchithrakuḍam in Thillai.
     When will the day come
     when I see him joyfully with my eyes?
------

The Story of Rāma.

742. He saved the sacrifice of the rishi Vishwamithra,
     learned in all the mantras and the Vedas
     shot a strong arrow and split open the chest of Thaḍagai
     when she came to fight him, making her blood flow out,
     and he killed all the strong Rakshasas.
     See, our dear god stays in the Thiruchithrakuḍam in Thillai,
     surrounded with cool flourishing groves
     blooming with flowers with green tender leaves,
     as he sits on a throne studded with diamonds,
     praised by three thousand Andaṇars.

743. To marry Sita whose long dark lovely eyes were lined with red,
     the heroic Rāma who conquered kings with sharp spears,
     broke the bow of Shiva, the angry bull rider carrying a mazhu weapon.
     He stays in divine Chithrakuḍam in Thillai surrounded by tall walls.
     I worship the feet of the worshipers of Rāma
     whose cruel bow conquers his mighty enemies.

744. As Rāma he left his kingdom, obeying the words of Kaikeyi
     whose curly hair was decorated with bunches of fresh flowers,
     went to the forest,
     crossed the Ganges with the help of Guhan, his dear devotee,
     and gave his sandals and his kingdom to Bharathan
     when his brother came to see him.
     He stays in beautiful Chithrakuḍam in Thillai.
     If devotees see him happily with their two eyes,
     they will be equal to the gods in the sky.

745. As Rāma he killed the Rakshasa Virāḍan
     with strong mountain-like arms,
     received a bow from the sage Agasthya, creator of rich Tamil,
     cut off the nose of the beautiful Rakshasi Surpanakha,
     took the lives of Karan and Dushanan,
     and bent his bow and shot arrows to kill the Raksasa Mārisan
     when he came as a golden deer.
     He stays in Chithrakuḍam in Thillai
     and this earth is fortunate that his devotees wander there
     bowing their heads and worshiping him.

746. As Rāma he was separated from Vaidehi, his lovely wife.
     He was sad when Jaṭāyu was killed by Ravanan and sent to Vaikuṇṭam,
     he became friends with the king of monkeys' Sugrivan
     and he killed Vali in the Kishkinda forest,
     relieving the suffering of Sugrivan.
     He made Hanuman burn Lanka
     ruled by Ravaṇan, the king of the Rakshasas,
     so that Hanuman’s anger would abate.
     I worship the feet of the devotees of Rāma,
     the dear god who stays happily in Thiruchithrakuḍam in Thillai.

747. As Rāma he shot his arrows to calm the stormy ocean,
     made a bridge with the help of the monkeys
     and reached Lanka on the other side of the sea.
     He killed the Rakshasas who carried strong long spears,
     took the life of Ravaṇa the king of Lanka
     and gave the kingdom to Ravaṇa’s brother Vibhishaṇa,
     and returning to Ayodhya with his wife as lovely as Lakshmi,
     he was seated on his throne.
     I will not consider anyone my king
     except Rāma the god of Thiruchithrakuḍam in Thillai.

748. Rāma who reached Ayodhya filled with gold
     and beautiful diamond-studded palaces,
     heard his own story
     from the mouths, red as coral, of his two sons
     born to Sita, the princess of Mithila, to save the world.
     If we hear and drink in the story of Rāma
     of Thiruchithrakudam in Thillai
     we have no need of sweet nectar.

749. Rāma is adorned with a jewel-studded ornament
     given by an Andanan who knew the Vedas
     because he saved his son.
     His brother Laksmaṇa killed the Rakshasa Ilavaṇan
     and Rāma granted him moksha.
     He was separated from his brother Laksmaṇa
     by the curse of the sage Durvasa.
     If our hearts never forget the lord
     of Thiruchithrakuḍam in Thillai,
     we will not have any trouble in our lives.

750. When the dear lord adorned with garlands
     returned from the forest, the gods in the sky welcomed him.
     By the grace of him who fought with the strong Asuras
     and conquered them
     all people and creatures in the world go to Vaikuṇṭam.
     He stays always in Thiruchithrakuḍam in Thillai.
     O devotees of Rāma, praise him saying, “avan ivan!”
     and worship him always.

751. Kulasekharan, the king of Uṛaiyur,
     who rules under a royal umbrella
     and carries a victorious shining sword
     composed a garland of ten Tamil pāsurams
     describing the endless fame of Rāma,
     the son of Dasharatha and the friend of Hanumān.
     If devotees know and recite these ten sweet Tamil pāsurams
     they will approach the feet of Nāraṇan who shines with goodness.

     You are worshipped by the fifteen sacrifices.
     You are the beautiful two—wisdom and renunciation,
     and the three devotions, devotion for god,
     the devotion that gives knowledge to know god,
     and the highest devotion that gives moksha.
     You are the seven and six and eight.
     You are many wisdoms,
     the true and the false.
     You are taste, light, touch, sound and smell.
     You, Māyan, are everything on earth
     yet who can see you?

754. You are the chief of the twenty-four philosophies,
     the five elements water, land, fire, wind and the sky,
     the five sense organs, body, mouth, eyes, nose and ears,
     the five organs of action, mouth, legs, hands, the unclean organs,
     the five senses, taste, sight, hearing, smell and touch
     and the four organs of knowledge,
     mind, ego, knowledge, and ignorance.
     You who stay in the sky are all these and more.
     O Māyan, who can see you?

755. You are the thirty-three Sanskrit sounds.
     You are the five consonants,
     and the sixteen vowels.
     You are the lord of the five special sounds in Tamil
     and the mantra with twelve sounds,
     “Om namo bhagavate Vāsudevāya.”
     You are the three faultless lights—the sun, the moon and the stars.
     You have entered my heart—why, O my lord?

756. You , the anceint one are everything on the earth,
     and the life of all creatures.
     No one knows who you are
     but you are in everyone and everything,
     there is no limit to you.
     You created Nanmuhan on your navel
     and he creates all creatures of the world.

757. Adisesha carries the earth and you,
     the mountains burden the earth,
     the sky carries the Ganges and the clouds,
     and you contain in yourself water, fire, wind, sky and the earth
     and protect them all and all are in you.

758. You are the Māyan, the cowherd,
     the three forms of the gods, Shiva, Vishnu and Nanmuhan,
     the sleep, the feelings of all, ,
     the two times, night and day,
     and the oceans, the earth, the three fires.
     You are the great one praised by three-eyed Shiva.

759. You are the most ancient of the ancient gods
     and you abide across the worlds
     and you know the birth of the ancient gods.
     Who can tell the time when you became the first one?

760. You are the pure one.
     Shiva with red matted hair
     adorned with kondrai garlands that drip pollen
     worships your feet as the Vedas say.
     The Vediyars who know the Vedas well
     and the sages who recite the sacrificial mantras
     worship you through the right paths that the sastras prescribe.

761. Just as the white waves born in the wide ocean
     rise and go back into the ocean,
     everything that is in the world is born from you,
     stays and lives in the world by your grace
     and goes back into you. Such is your nature.

762. Can words even begin to describe you,
     who are the sounds that form the words of the Vedas,
     the meaning of all the words in the Vedas,
     and the light that cannot be described by words.
     You created Nanmuhan and he creates
     all the creatures of the world by your order.

763. You created the world,
     you swallowed, spat it out
     and again you created it again.
     The world is within you
     and you are separate from it also.
     You do not remain in one place.
     Who knows how you are in this world?

764. No one can say just what or who you are.
     Some say that you are the beloved of Nappinnai,
     and some say you are only a cowherd
     and play with cowherd girls.
     Who can know your name, your place,
     your birth and what form you will take in the future?
     No one can know your nature.

765. You who are pure yoga and carry in your hands
     the Sarngam bow adorned with thulasi garlands
     are the ancient one who took the form of a turtle.
     You rest on the deep ocean.
     We do not know what your name is,
     but we say you are the creator of the Samaveda
     and the Vedas praise you.

766. You are the four Vedas, the six Upanishads
     and their meaning.
     You, the precious one
     rest on the wide ocean on many-headed Adishesha.
     Aren’t you the one with a white conch and the Sarngam bow?

767. You are the souls of the gods,
     plants, people who do good and bad karma and animals.
     Even though people do not know who you are,
     they hear of you from the Vedas and the scriptures of the sages
     and they know you in their hearts.
     Your greatness is like that of high mountains.

768. You are unique,
     but you, limitless, are also the three gods,
     Shiva, Vishnu and Nānmuhan, and the four gods.
     You who rest on Adishesha on the wide ocean
     are the source of good karma,
     and give joy and goodness to all.
     No one can comprehend your form.
     How can you, the ancient god,
     come to the world in human form?

769. You rest on the snake bed of Adishesha with a thousand mouths,
     and two thousand fiery eyes,
     who makes a roof for you and is never apart from you.
     You have the color of the ocean—
     why do you rest on the ocean?

770. You who carry a shining discus
     took the form of a swan
     and taught the Vedas to the sages,
     split open the mouth of the Asuran
     when he came as a bird,
     and ride on the eagle.
     Even though you carry an eagle flag,
     why do you love to rest on the ocean on Adisesha,
     the snake that is an enemy of the eagle?

771. Without being shy,
     you rest on a snake on the ocean
     and the gods come there and sing and praise you.
     O Kesava who took the form of a turtle
     that lives in moss-covered water,
     why did you do that and allow others to say bad things about you?
     Tell us so we can understand you.

772. You are the lord of Srirangam.
     When you churned the ocean of milk
     the waves were wild, the water was stirred up,
     trees fell and the large earth shook
     as the snake Vasuki suffered.
     What did the Asuras do?
     When you went to Lanka to fight with Ravaṇa,
     you were happy to get the help of the monkeys.
     You are our father!
     Tell us how all that happened so we can understand you.

773. You, the highest on the earth,
     the ancient god adorned with a thulasi garland
     that swarms with bees, are the past, present and future.
     Taking the form of the child Kaṇṇan,
     you swallowed all the seven worlds and slept on a banyan leaf,
     you who embrace on your chest the goddess Lakshmi.

774. You took the form of a white lion
     and with your claws, split open the chest
     of Hiraṇyan with shining teeth.
     You, the Padmanabhan, rest on the ocean of milk,
     and famous yogis recite the four Vedas and worship you.

775. O marvelous one,
     the water of the Ganges flows from your lotus feet
     and you carry in your beautiful hands
     a discus, a conch, a club, a bow and a sword.
     O god of gods who took the form of a man-lion,
     the goddess Lakshmi, adorned with beautiful blossoms
     dripping with pollen, lives on your chest.
     O Māyan, your body has the blue color of the ocean.

776. You took the form of a man-lion,
     split open Hiraṇyan’s chest with your claws and killed him
     who had received many boons doing hard penance.
     You came as a dwarf and begged for land from Mahābali,
     but what kind of lie was that, since the world was already yours?
     Did you hide the land in your stomach
     that you received by begging him?
     O Kaṇṇa! Who has the ability to know what you think?

777. You have taken form of a man, Rāma, and a woman, Mohini.
     You are what is good and what is evil,
     food, sound and smell,
     the false and the true,
     and you are illusory and appear to be nothing.
     You have been a cowherd looking after bulls
     and you went to Mahābali as a dwarf and took his land.
     You are a thief.

778. You who destroy people’s sins
     are the light that shines crossing the sky,
     the bright form of wisdom and music.
     You went to king Mahābali as a dwarf-sage,
     begged for his land,
     and measured the earth with one foot,
     grew tall and measured the sky with the other.
     Who will respect you for how you cheated Mahābali?

779. You, the Māyan carrying the discus in your strong hand
     created the earth, swallowed the earth and spat it out,
     and you created the oceans and slept on a banyan leaf.
     When the Asuras Thirumāli and Sumali came to fight with you,
     you sent them to Yama’s world,
     O you who went as a dwarf and measured the world.

780. You who are the highest god of the gods
     and the form of wisdom rest on the ocean,
     keeping Lakshmi on your chest and embracing her.
     You came to this earth in human forms.
     No one can say what your nature is.

781. You who are the sky, earth, hills, and seven oceans
     are as lovely as a lotus and you carry a victorious lotus.
     You enjoyed the food served for Indra and slept on a banyan leaf,
     you shot a stone from your sling and hit Manthara’s hunched back
     and you are adorned with a lovely fragrant cool thulasi garland
     that drips with pollen.

     You live thinking they are your refuge.

     worship our ancient Thirumāl..

821. The gods in the sky,
     carrying clubs, tridents, spears, drums, sticks and swords,

823. The goddess Lakshmi stays on a lotus,
     the earth goddess stays with Thirumāl,
     while Nānmuhan, the god’s son, sits on the lotus on his navel.

     became his vehicle.
     That is the truth and no one can deny it.

824. He shot his arrows
     and made holes in the seven mara trees.
     As Rāma, he shot his arrows at Vali's chest and killed him.
     Even the rulers of the sky
     will not receive the endless joy of moksha
     unless our god has given them his grace to receive it.

825. If you really know that your refuge is the feet of him
     who took the form of Vāmanan and worship him,
     you will have wealth and wonderful wisdom.
     If you praise Thirumāl
     who rests on the ocean with its clear rolling waves,
     you will not have the results of your bad karma.

826. Only those who do good tapas thinking only of the lord
     and who think constantly of the nature of Thirumāl
     will go to heaven and stay with the other gods forever.
     Except for those devotees no one can see the lovely-eyed Thirumāl.

827. Only if people control the feelings that arise from their senses
     and light up their wisdom by following the good path
     and melt in their bones and hearts for him
     and love him who carries a discus can they see him. CHECK

828. The ancient lord is eight and eight and eight,
     he is seven and seven and seven,
     and he is eight and three and one.
     Devotees worshiping with the eight letter mantra,
     “Om namo Nārāyaṇāya,” will go to heaven and rule there.

829. If people love him tirelessly
     and think of him always in their minds,
     reciting the eight-letter mantra with love
     and worshiping the beautiful ankleted feet
     of the god who rests on the snake bed on the ocean,
     they will go to heaven and rule there.

830. He is the ten directions,
     the soul of the ten guardians of the directions,
     the nine notes of music, the nine rasas of dance
     and he, the ancient and the most powerful one,
     came to this world in ten avatharams.
     Only if devotees worship him with devotion
     will they reach moksha.

831. When the Asuran Thenugam approached the lord without love
     pretending to be his friend, he cut off his arms
     but then he gave him moksa.
     No one can reach moksha except the devotees
     who worship the ankleted feet of the lord with love..

832. The lord stays in the Thiruvenkatam hills
     who churned the milky ocean
     and rests on the ocean forever.
     He gave his grace to Vāli after killing him,
     and destroyed the seven trees with one arrow
     If you worship the feet of Thirumāl you will be saved.

833. You who rest on the snake bed on the ocean,
     the highest of the high,
     are the incomparable one whom no one can know.
     If devotees have destroyed their desires
     and released themselves from attachment to the world,
     they will receive happiness here, there and everywhere in all ways.

834. O you who wear cool thulasi garlands that drip pollen,
     if someone controls his mind and worships you
     with the eight letter mantra, “Om Namo Narayanaya,”
     the joy he receives is higher than the joy of attaining moksha.

835. Does he who carries the discus
     want me to be born again?
     Does he know the day he made me love his ankleted feet?
     I am ignorant, incapable of doing anything,
     and do not know how to love him.
     O dear lord, what did you find in me
     to make me your devotee?

836. O lord resting on the snake bed,
     I know your magic.
     You know how to make my mind
     that is interested in other worldly things
     leave them and be devoted to your lotus feet.
     You are truly clever.
     If you make me fascinated with you,
     what kind of fascination is that?
     O Māyan, give me your grace
     so I am not involved in worldly things.

837. Dance, dance with your feet.
     You danced on the heads of the snake Kālingan
     stirring the water in the pond,
     O you who carry a conch in your hand.
     I worship your beautiful feet every day
     and think of you always.
     Why have you not granted me moksha yet, O Kaṇṇa.

838. You are the Vedas.
     Shiva with an eye in his forehead,
     the wise Nānmuhan staying on the lotus
     and all other gods together worship your feet with love.
     I will not speak of any other love
     except the love that I have for you.

839. My generous lord churned the milky ocean,
     using the mountain for a churning stick,
     a turtle to support the mountain
     and the white-fanged snake Vasuki for the rope.
     He took the nectar that came from the ocean,
     gave it to the gods in the sky,
     and took away their troubles.
     I will not worship any one except him.

840. You became the charioteer for Arjuna,
     destroyed the Kauravas
     and gave the land to the five Pandavas,
     sending their enemies to the sky
     and saving the earth from evil ones.
     O victorious one, I will not worship any other except you. .

841. I was not born in one of the four varnas.
     I have not learned any of the good arts
     and do not recite the Vedas with my tongue.

     O pure one, I have no good knowledge
     and I have no refuge except your shining feet.

842. For the sake of Sita with sharp sword-like eyes
     and soft words like music

     and no relatives to be with except you.
     You have endless magic.
     How can I ever take you from my heart?

843. O cowherd who destroyed the seven bulls
     and embraced the arms of Nappinnai and married her
     with spear-like eyes that attracted all,
     you created the oceans, you churned the milky ocean
     and you rest on it. I come to you as my refuge.
     Give me refuge, tell me, “Don’t be afraid!”

844. You, the god of Srirangam,
     adorned with a cool thulasi garland that swarms with bees,
     give your grace to those who love and worship your feet.
     You, as sweet as a bundle of sugarcane,
     are Kaṇṇan resting on the ocean.
     As Rāma, you shot powerful arrows with your bow
     and destroyed the iron forts of Lanka.

845. You who are the life in our bodies,
     our sleep and feelings,
     the five things given by the cow,
     the purity in all,
     the sky and the earth,
     the rich ocean and the things in it.

     You are our god and you are Rāma.

846. I have destroyed the desires that come from the evil senses
     cut off all the relations I had with others,

     and enjoy the pleasures of the five senses,
     my only desire is to be with you.
     I have no eyes except you,
     O my king who rest on the ocean.

847. You do endless magic.
     Even if all the true seven worlds were to praise you
     for all the seven yugas, it would not be enough,

     O Pundariga! Please give me a boon
     so I may escape from all my endless births
     and come to your ankleted feet.

848. In your beautiful hands you carry
     a discus, conch, club, bow and sword.

     Show me a way to come to you.

849. I have left all the evil acts that I was committing
     and now I have no cunning or fault,
     none of the desires that the five senses bring.

     of not being born and dying anymore and I will not forget you.

850. You, the beloved of Nappinnai,
     have the color of the kāyām flower.
     My soul is tied to you.
     I hear that the messengers of Yama

     but I have locked you up in my heart with Nappinnai
     and you save me from committing those sins.

851. You are Māyan whom no one can reach easily.

     so I may worship your feet through devotion for you always.

852. I want to ask you one thing,
     O you who have the color of the ocean.

     won’t you also consider giving me your grace
     so I may keep your lotus feet in my heart forever?

853. O Māyan resting on the ocean with seething water,
     my love for you is limitless
     and I worship your shining lotus feet in my heart
     so that they will take away all my troubles.
     You, the victorious divine hero, took the form of a boar
     and carried Govardhana mountain
     to save the cows by sheltering them from the storm.
     O lord, tell me how I can not be born and suffer in this world.

854. O dark-colored god with the beautiful Lakshmi on your chest,

     adorned with golden anklets
     whether I am resting, standing or walking.

856. You swallowed the earth,
     and you begged for land and took it from Mahābali,
     measuring it till there was no place you had not taken.
     O lord with lotus eyes who embrace the woman
     whose sweet words surpass music,
     there is no other color like your color.

857. O god carrying a conch, club, bow and a sword,
     your discus cut off the head of Yama
     when he came angrily to fight with you
     and you carried Govardhana mountain to save the cows
     when the storm came to destroy the cowherd village.
     My heart loves nothing except your fame
     that is spread everywhere.

858. You destroyed the angry king of Kasi,
     Vakkaran, Pavuṇḍran, the furious Maliman,
     Sumali, Kesi and Thenugan.
     I will not give my love and affection to anyone,
     only to your anklet-adorned feet.

859. Even if I received faultless boons
     and could go to the world of Nanmuhan
     filled with abundant and indestructible wealth
     or the world of Shiva
     who has the power of destroying the world
     or the world of thousand-eyed Indra,
     even if I could have all the pleasures of moksha,
     I would not accept or think of anything
     except to be with you.

860. You became a dwarf
     even though no one made you small,
     and, without anyone making you bigger,
     you became tall even though no one made you tall
     and touched the sky.
     All the sages recite the Vedas,
     praise you and say that you are the god of gods
     and you destroy the evil of the proud,
     and I join them in your praise.

861. You, Māyan, the pure one
     wearing a cool thulasi garland that swarms with bees,
     I, a dog, bow to you and worship you.
     who are colored like the ocean and rest on the water of the sea.
     You enter the thoughts of your devotees.
     Forgive all my faults and give me your grace.

862. You are the lord of the world.
     Sages say that even they who slander you like Sisupalan
     or fight with you like Ravaṇa in Lanka
     have reached your world and joined with you by your grace O Māyan.
     Take the mistakes that I, as low as a dog,
     do as good deeds and forgive me.

863. O my heart, time will pass,
     we will all get sick and grow old
     and the time of our death will come near.
     Bow to the divine feet of the god and worship him.
     You should know that being a devotee of the god
     is the only good thing. Only the feet of Thirumāl
     can give you the joy of never being born again.

864. When Nanmuhan cursed dark-necked Shiva
     in whose matted hair the Ganges flows
     and Nanmuhan’s skull was stuck to Shiva’s palm,
     our god whose chest is adorned with a fragrant garland
     gave his blood and made Nanmuhan’s skull fall away.
     O heart, think of the god’s thulasi garland and worship him
     so that you will reach his Vaikuṇṭam.

865. O heart, if you want to remove the eight bad thoughts
     and live without fault and reach moksha and rule the world,
     you must think and worship the feet of the god, our father,
     who is wisdom, the sun, and the world,
     who took the form of a single-tusked boar and split open the earth.

866. Our ruler and our mother, he destroys all our births,
     makes us his devotees and gives us his grace.
     O poor heart! He is Mukundan, the ancient one.
     If we worship him he will enter us, stay with us
     and remove our ocean of sorrow.

867. Rāma the heroic one, went to Lanka,
     fought with Ravana whose sword was mighty,
     burned it, killed Ravaṇa and conquered Lanka.
     My god does not think that I am like his enemies.
     Yama will not think of the sins
     I have done and afflict me
     because I am a devotee of the god.

868. He will take you to heaven
     removing your fears, sickness, old age
     and all your births.
     Achudan, Anandan, the lord who fulfills his promises,
     and has no beginning or end
     rests on the snake bed
     and is praised by the Vedas.

869. O lord, beloved of Lakshmi,
     I worshipped you with my words and in my deeds
     and loved you unceasingly,
     night and day, morning and evening.
     My heart worshiped your lotus feet
     and now it stays with you and will never come back to me.

870. O Māyan with the color of a kāyām flower,
     god of Srirangam surrounded by the Ponni river, hear me.
     My heart has given up my bad karma
     and worships your shining flower feet
     remaining with them without ever growing tired.

871. You, colored like a cloud, the everlasting shining light,
     took away all my future births and saved me today.
     You came to me, entered my heart and bewitched me
     and now my soul has been released from all pain
     and has attained moksha, the house of joy.
------------

## 06. Thirumālai : Thoṇḍaraḍippoḍi Azhvar (872-916)

872. You, the ancient one,
     swallowed the three worlds and spit them out.
     We do not like the feeling
     that come from the enjoyment of our five senses
     and we do not sin anymore.
     The messengers of Yama cannot hurt us now.
     We are brave because we have learned your names
     and recite them, O god of Srirangam.

873. Your body is like a beautiful green hill,
     your lotus eyes are handsome
     and your mouth is red as coral.
     O father, bull among the gods
     and tender child of the cowherds,
     I want only to praise you with these words.
     I do not want anything
     even if it were the gift of ruling Indra’s world,
     O god of Srirangam.

874. Even if a man lives for hundred years,
     half of those years he spends resting.
     Many he spends as an innocent child and as a youth
     and the rest he spends suffering sickness, hunger,
     old age and other ills.
     I do not want to be born any more in this world,
     O god of Srirangam.

875. When Kstrabandu suffered from bad karma,
     he worshipped the god,
     recited the three syllables of the word “Govinda”
     and received moksha
     but even though I continually worship Rangan,
     the crazy god who gave his grace to devotees like Ksatrabandu,
     he has not taken away my births.

876. If people enjoy the pleasures of women
     they will fall into many troubles.
     They will get sick and suffer, unable to eat night and day.
     Why do those base ones not become the devotees
     of the god whose chest is adorned with cool thulasi garlands,
     singing and dancing his praise?
     They only enjoy the food they eat and do not realize
     that worshiping the god is like drinking nectar.

877. You build tall walls for your palaces
     that have long porches and enjoy living in them
     and you do not think at all of your next birth.
     You do not become a devotee of the god Rangan
     whose walls are dharma.
     You decorate the exterior wall that is your body
     and live inside it as if you were a bird
     concerned with nothing else.

878. If people learn the good religious books,
     how can they hear, see and learn
     about the dharma of the mean religions, Buddhism and Jainism?
     If I think of any other god,
     I promise that even if someone cuts off my head
     I will not die because I am a devotee of the god.
     The only god of gods destroyed Lanka with his bow.

879. O god of Srirangam,
     the bald-headed Jains, Buddhists and the Sakyas
     hate our religion and say terrible things about you.
     It is better if they get sick and die rather than living.
     When I hear their evil speech, it hurts me.
     If I could, I would cut off their heads.

880. O ignorant men! Is there any other god?
     You will not understand that he is the only god
     unless you are in trouble.
     You should know one thing for sure:
     there is no god except him.
     Worship the ankleted feet of our father
     who grazed the calves.

881. He created all the gods by his good grace
     and showed Srirangam as the path
     to those wishing to be released from their births.
     O Nambis, listen.
     The god riding the eagle is here,
     but you look only for the wealth that is achieved by bad deeds.

882. Our god, the protector of the world,
     built a bridge on the large ocean, shooting one arrow,
     and he fought with the king of the Rakshasas in Lanka.
     You do not think of the beautiful temple
     in Srirangam surrounded by forts,
     and so you do not have good luck in this birth but waste your life.

883. Once some people heard
     Yama and Muthkalan talking together in hell
     and thought that hell is heaven.
     They forgot that the place of the many-named dear god Nambi
     is Srirangam and they did not worship the god there.
     They plunged into sorrow and I am worried
     that they will have trouble in their lives.

884. All the creatures of this wide earth
     surrounded by oceans with rolling waves
     worship the king of the gods in the sky
     adorned with a fragrant blooming thulasi garland.
     If ignorant people praise Srirangam,
     all the hells that have been created for them
     because of their enjoyment of the senses
     will be destroyed and disappear.

885. Beautiful Srirangam is surrounded with groves
     where bunches of bees swarm around flowers, peacocks dance,
     clouds float above in the sky and cuckoos sing.
     Indra the king of the gods comes and stays there.
     Such is lovely Srirangam.
     You should take the food that the evil people eat
     who do not praise Srirangam filled with beautiful groves
     and give it to the dogs.

886. The king of the gods with an eagle flag
     is true for people if they think he is true
     and he is false if they think he is not true.
     If someone thinks he can escape birth
     only by worshiping the god,
     his doubts about the god will go away
     and he will understand
     that Srirangam is the Thirupadi of the beautiful god.

887. I was a gambler and a thief.
     I consorted with bad people
     and was caught in the love-nets of fish-eyed women.
     But the beautiful god said, “Come out!”
     and entered my mind and made me love him.
     Srirangam is the Thirupadi of the beautiful god
     who made me love him.

888. I don’t know how to praise you with my tongue
     and I don’t have the good luck of knowing how to love you
     or a good mind that knows how to glorify you.
     My strong iron-like heart melted
     to see the sweet sugarcane-like god
     of the wonderful temple in Srirangam
     surrounded with groves swarming with bees.
     How my eyes were delighted when I saw him!

889. My lotus-eyed god
     rules the world, resting on the ocean
     where waves break on the banks
     and spray drops of water with foam.
     My eyes that saw Kaṇṇan
     with a red mouth as soft as a fruit shed tears.
     What can I, a sinner, do?

890. My father, the blue ocean-colored lord,
     rests on the snake bed,
     and as he rests his head is on the west side,
     his feet are extended toward the east,
     his back is turned toward the north
     and he looks toward Lanka in the south.
     When I look at him as he rests my body melts.
     O people of the world, what can I do?

891. The Māyanār who rests on a snake bed
     in Srirangam where the water of the Kaviri flows over its banks,
     has a beautiful divine chest,
     strong arms, pure lotus eyes,
     lovely coral lips and shining hair
     and his body has the color of an emerald.
     How could his devotees forget his beautiful form?

892. O heart, you are humble
     and you want me to make my mind one
     with Rangan, whose mouth is red as coral.
     You are strong and tell me
     that I should always think of the god, beautiful as a jewel,
     resting in the mountain-like temple of beautiful, precious gold.
     Tell me how can I approach him?

893. O heart, you may speak of him
     but you cannot really know his greatness.
     No one can know him unless they are faultless.
     We can only worship him
     who stays in the hearts of his faultless devotees.
     O ignorant heart, can you speak of him? Tell me.

894. Srirangam is in the middle of the Kaveri river
     which is purer than the Ganges.
     and its water rises and spreads through blooming groves.
     Our dear Thirumāl, our Esan, rests there on the river.
     How can I live forgetting him
     after seeing him resting on the water of the Kaveri?
     I am to be pitied, I am to be pitied.

895. I see his beautiful lotus face
     and I see how that thief who stole my heart
     rests on the Kaveri in Srirangam
     surrounded by a rising flood of water
     and flourishing with groves.
     O my heart, you are brave.
     You know he is the one you really love,
     but you love him secretly and spend your days
     without telling anyone.

896. I have not lived the life of an orthodox Vediyan
     bathing and making sacrifices with three fires.
     I do not understand myself
     and I am not a devotee in your eyes.
     What is there for me to be happy about?
     O Nambi colored blue like the ocean,
     I cry out for you. Show pity on me
     and give me your grace, lord of Srirangam!

897. I don’t worship your golden feet,
     decorating them constantly with flowers.
     Even though I have much time,
     I don’t praise your divine qualities with faultless words.
     My heart doesn’t know how to love you.
     O Ranga, I don’t have the fortune of being your devotee.
     What can I do? I was born in vain.

898. I am like the innocent squirrel
     that went to Rāma for refuge after rolling and immersing itself
     in the wave-filled water as it tried to help the monkeys
     when they took mountains to build the bridge for Rāma to go to Lanka.
     My heart is as hard as wood and I am a bad person.
     I have not served the lord of Srirangam with my mind
     and am tired and wretched.

899. Even the gods in the sky do not understand the radiant lord
     who came to protect the elephant Gajendra
     and grew angry at the crocodile that ate red meat.
     Am I fit for him to come to me?
     I am mean, like a dog and I have not served him.
     What can I do? I was born in vain.

900. I don’t belong to a village or own any land.
     I have no relatives.
     I worship the feet of you, the highest one, on this earth
     and know no other refuge,
     O you with the bright color of the dark clouds.
     O Kaṇṇa! I cry out for you.
     Whom do I have without you as my support?
     Come and remove my sorrow,
     you who are my mother, lord of Srirangam.

901. I don’t have a pure mind and no good words come from my mouth.
     I get very angry, shout and say bad things.
     You are adorned with fresh thulasi garlands,
     lord of Srirangam, surrounded by the Ponni river.
     Tell me, what will happen to me, O my king.

902. O lord of Srirangam,
     I have not done tapas like the sages, I am not wealthy,
     and I am as useless as salty water for my friends and relatives.
     I fell for women whose mouths are like coral
     and became like dust when I didn’t have money.
     You gave me this birth only to make me suffer.

903. O Kaṇṇan with a body as dark as a thick cloud,
     lord of beautiful Srirangam
     where bees sing and swarm in the groves,
     I don’t know even one path to take to see you.
     I am a thief, I am violent, stupid and rough.
     I come to you. You are my refuge.

904. I stopped telling the truth
     and fell into the passion of women with long hair.
     I told only lies and now I have no refuge.
     I, a liar, come and stand before you, O lord, Ranga,
     hoping that you will give me your grace.
     I am a liar, a liar.

905 Thirumāl abides in my mind
but I am unable to understand that he is there.
I am a thief disguised as a devotee doing service.
When I realized that you are in the minds of those
who think of you and you know what they think,
I was ashamed and laughed so hard
that it seemed the bones in my chest would break.

906. O my father who measured all the world with your feet,
     I, a sinner, will not worship anyone but you,
     the lovely-eyed Thirumāl, my soul, my nectar,
     my father, as dear to me as my life.
     I am a sinner, truly I am a sinner.

907. When you were young
     you carried Govardhana mountain to stop the storming rain,
     O you who are like a sweet river.
     I suffer, caught in the net of doe-eyes women—
     why don’t you look at me and give me your grace?
     I have no one but you. I call you,
     O ancient one, god of Srirangam.

908. The bright lord is my father and mother,
     the god of Srirangam
     surrounded by the clear water of the Kaviri.
     I am a poor person.
     My dear lord doesn’t show me even a little compassion,
     he doesn’t think, “He is pitiful, I should help him.”
     What is this, O lord, Isn’t this a terrible thing to do?

909. You, lord of Srirangam surrounded by water,
     are happy with devotees
     if they abandon their wealth, understand divine truth,
     know what will they be in the future,
     control their five senses, shave their heads
     and stay at your doorstep, living a quiet life.

910. O lord of Srirangam
     whose hair is decorated with a thulasi garland,
     no one has to be born in a good family to become your slave.
     Even if someone is born like a dog
     and doesn’t belong to the families of Vediyars,
     if he worships your feet ornamented with sounding anklets,
     it seems you will be happy with him,

911. O lord of Srirangam
     with beautiful Lakshmi on your chest,
     even if hunters kill animals cruelly,
     burn and eat them,
     if they think of you in their minds
     and keep you there with love, worshiping you,
     their bad karma will disappear
     and they will not suffer.

912. Even bad people who do evil things
     and make others do evil deeds,
     if they praise you saying, “You are the god of the sky.
     Even the gods in the sky do not understand you
     who are adorned with a thulasi garland
     that swarms with bees,”
     and if they become your slaves and offer food to your devotees,
     they will become pure.

913. Lord of Srirangam surrounded with walls,
     you give your grace to all who worship you, and you tell them,
     “Even if you belong to a low caste, you should recite the Vedas,
     follow a faultless way of life and become my devotee,
     mingling with other devotees, worshiping them,
     giving them whatever they need
     and sharing your things with them.”
     Isn’t that the way you give grace to poor people
     and make them worship you as your good devotees?

914. O lord of beautiful Srirangam,
     if even Vediyars of the highest caste
     who recite the six divine Upanishads and the four Vedas
     disgrace your devotees,
     they will become Pulaiyars in a moment.

915. Shiva with the Ganges in his matted hair
     and Nanmuhan who did tapas for countless ages
     could not see you and felt ashamed.
     You came and gave your grace to the elephant Ganjendra,
     amazing the gods in the sky.
     Why do people think of you as their refuge
     and hope you will remove their suffering
     when you do not show your grace to all like me?

916. Thoṇḍaraḍippoḍi, the pious devotee
     praised Kaṇṇan, Thirumāl, the god of Srirangam
     who killed the strong well-fed elephant in flourishing Madurai
     that has beautiful palaces decorated with coral.
     If devotees recite his simple pāsurams
     they will become his sweet devotees.
----------------

## 07. Thiruppaḷḷi Ezhuchi - Thoṇḍaraḍippoḍi Azhvar (917-926)

917. When the sun rises in the east from the peak of the mountain
     and darkness has gone and it is morning
     and all the beautiful flowers that drip honey bloom,
     the gods of the sky all come before you to worship you.
     Elephants, male and female, come and, as drums are beaten,
     it seems the sound of a roaring ocean spreads everywhere.
     O dear god of Srirangam, wake up and give us your grace.

918. The breeze from the east blows
     and spreads the fragrance of mullai flowers blooming on vines.
     The swans sleeping on flowers wake up
     and shake the wet dew from their wings.
     O lord, when the elephant Gajendra was suffering
     and called you in his distress,
     you came and saved him, killing the crocodile
     whose mouth with white teeth was as deep as a cave.
     O dear god of Srirangam,
     wake up and give us your grace.

919. The sun with its rays makes all the directions bright,
     the darkness goes away, dawn appears,
     the bright light of the moon and the dew go away,
     the buds on the branches of the kamuhu trees in the green groves
     split open spreading their fragrance and the morning breeze blows.
     O dear god of Srirangam with a shining discus in your strong hand,
     wake up and give us you grace.

920. The cowherds untie their buffaloes for grazing
     and the music of their bamboo flutes
     and the sound of the cowbells spread in all directions
     as swarms of bees fly all over the fields.
     You who carry a bow, the strong king of Ayodhya,
     bull among the gods,
     destroyed the clan of Rakshasas in Lanka
     and you, the strong one, helped the pure sages
     do sacrifices and protected them.
     O dear god of Srirangam, wake up and give us your grace.

921. Birds chirp in the groves blooming with flowers,
     the darkness goes away and morning arrives.
     In the east, the ocean roars
     and the gods in the sky carry many flower garlands
     swarming with bees and come to garland you
     and worship your feet.
     This is the temple where Vibhishaṇa,
     the king of Lanka, worshiped you.
     O dear god, wake up and give us your grace.

922. Is this the host of suns riding on tall chariots decorated with bells?
     Is it the troupe of eleven Rudras riding on bulls?
     Is that the six faced-god riding a beautiful peacock?
     All these gods and the celestial physicians and the Vasus are here,
     while the other divine gods come on horses and chariots singing and dancing.
     The crowd of gods is like a flood
     and they have gathered in front of your temple that looks like a huge mountain.
     O dear god of Srirangam, wake up and give us your grace

923. Is this the crowd of gods from heaven?
     Is this the throng of sages doing penance
     and the medicine men of the gods?
     Is that Indra coming on his elephant Airāvata?
     In front of your temple, Gandharvas, Vidyadharas
     and Apsarases are all gathered together to worship you
     and it seems as if there is no space left in the sky or on the earth.
     O dear god of Srirangam, wake up and give us your grace.

924. Some gods in the sky arrive with fragrances,
     some carry huge pots of treasure
     and shining mirrors and come to give them to you.
     Good sages bring things suitable for you to wear
     and Nārada comes with his Thumburu veena to play music.
     The sun god rises, spreading his bright light
     and darkness disappears from the sky.
     O dear god of Srirangam, wake up and give us your grace.

925. Faultless small drums, cymbals,
     yāzhs, flutes and big drums play music everywhere.
     Kinnaras, Garuḍas, Gandarvas and others sing.
     The sages, the gods in the sky, Saraṇars, Yaksas,
     and Siddhas are all fascinated by the music
     and come to worship your divine feet.
     O dear god of Srirangam, wake up and give us your grace.

926. Are these fragrant blooming lotuses?
     Is this the sun god rising over the roaring ocean?
     You are the god of Srirangam surrounded by a river
     where curly-haired women with waists as small as tuḍi drums
     bathe, squeeze their clothes,
     and come out of the water to dress.
     I am Thoṇḍaraḍippoḍi, your poor devotee.
     I brought thulasi garlands in baskets to decorate your body.
     I am your slave. Give me your grace.
     O dear god of Srirangam, wake up and give me your grace.

-----------------
## 08. Amalan Aadipirān. - Thiruppāṇāzhvār (927-936)

927. He, the faultless one, the king of the gods in the sky
     who gives us his grace and makes us his devotees,
     is pure, the lord of the Thiruvenkaṭam hills
     surrounded with fragrant groves.
     He is the god of justice in the sky,
     and the dear one of Srirangam surrounded by tall walls.
     His lotus feet came and entered my sight.

928. He is pleasant and joyful measured the world,
     growing so tall that his crown touched the sky,
     and as Rāma of the Kakutstha dynasty
     he killed the Rakshasas with his cruel arrows.
     My thoughts are immersed in the red garment
     that adorns the waist of the god of Srirangam
     surrounded by fragrant groves.

929. Female monkeys jump everywhere
     in the Thiruvenkaṭam hills in the north
     where the gods in the sky come to worship
     the lord resting on the snake bed.
     He wears a red garment with the color of the evening sky
     and above that is Nānmuhan whom he created.
     His beauty is this devotee’s life.

930. The ocean-colored god shot sharp arrows,
     conquering and killing the ten-headed Ravaṇa, king of Lanka
     surrounded by high walls on all four sides.
     The beautiful ornament tied on the divine waist
     of the god of Srirangam
     where bees that drink honey sing
     and beautiful peacocks dance
     entered my heart and stayed there.

931. Making me his dear devotee and entering my heart.
     He removed all the bad karma that has burdened me all my life.

     made me his slave and protects me.

932. Our father, the lord of Srirangam
     surrounded with groves where bees live
     removed the suffering of Shiva

     swallowed all the seven worlds,

     and precious, lovely diamond chains.
     Oh, his blue body has stolen my heart!

     skilled in the four Vedas
     do not think I am a good person,
     but Sadagopan Nambi accepts me
     and he is my mother, my chief and my ruler.

941. Before, I believed in the wealth of others
     and beautiful women,
     but today I have become a friend and devotee
     of Nambi of Thirukkuruhur,
     filled with pure golden palaces, and I dance there.

942. My dear god gave his grace
     so I could praise his fame from today

     accepted me and made my bad karma go away.
     I will tell the people of all the eight directions
     of the grace I have received
     from Sadagopan, the wonderful Tamil poet.

944. He sang a thousand sweet Tamil pāsurams
     through the grace of god
     and described the meaning of the divine Vedas
     so that his devotees praise the blessings
     that he received from the god.
     His giving his blessing is the best thing in the world.

     is the greatest love I can receive. CHECK

946. Nambi will accept anyone as his devotee
     whether or not he receives benefit from him,
     even if he is not his friend.
     The Nambi Thirukkuruhur
     surrounded by beautiful groves where cuckoo birds sing
     will change him and accept him, and keep him with him.
     I am striving to receive the love of Nambi,
     worshipping his ankleted feet.

947. Nambi of south Thirukuruhur, our friend,
     is the friend of all who approach him.
     If devotees believe in Madhurakavi’s words,
     they will see Vaikuṇṭam and abide there.

## 10. Periya Thirumozhi, Thirumangai Azhvar (pāsurams 948 -2031)
### 01. Praise of the name of the lord ‘Nārāyaṇā’

948. I was born with sorrow.
     I withered and suffered in life.
     When I was young my only wish
     was to love women and be with them.
     I searched for a way to escape
     from my desire for women and wandered everywhere.
     I searched for the feeling that would lead me
     to the highest state and found the name “Nārāyaṇa.”

949. I thought of the round breasts of women
     and melted to embrace them.
     I told women, “You are my life. You are my nectar.”
     How many days and how many ages
     have been wasted since I, a sinner,
     acted without realizing what I am doing.
     I worshiped the god of Kuḍandai
     surrounded with water
     where swans with white feathers embrace their mates.
     I praised him with my tongue,
     discovered the name “Nārāyaṇa.”
     and I am saved in this life itself.

950. I desired only a happy life and gained bad karma.
     I thought only of the beauty of women.

951. I wanted to be successful in everything.
     I desired to have much wealth that would never be lost.

     What can I do?
     You grew to the sky at the sacrifice of king Mahābali
     and you took the form of a boar, went to the underworld
     and brought back the earth goddess, stolen by an Asuran.
     Through your grace
     I have found the name “Nārāyaṇa” and am saved.

952. I have been a thief and done many wrong things.
     I wandered around as I wanted
     but now my mind has found the truth.
     When I discovered the right path that leads to him
     at once I received his divine grace.
     My heart melts and my voice grows weak.
     As tears fall all over my body
     all day until the middle of the dark night
     I call out the divine name, “Nārāyaṇa!”

953. My dear father is my kin, my king and my life,
     frightened the Rakshasas and killed them with his arrows.
     O devotees, worship the beautiful diamond-studded temple in Thanjai
     surrounded with strong walls and blooming with fragrant groves.
     O Nambis! I have found the name “Nārāyaṇa” and I am saved.

     You praise the people in the world as you want, saying,
     “This one is from a reputable family.

     This one is as generous as a Karpaga tree.”
     Come and I will tell you something.
     Go and worship the lord of Kuḍandai, surrounded with water,
     and you will find the most excellent of things.
     Sing and praise the name, “Nārāyaṇa” and you will be saved.

955. I have not learned what is good for me.
     I have thought only of the desires that my five senses bring.
     Innocent, I have done no good deeds in my life.
     I wandered around doing only evil to all
     in this large world, but I have stopped that now.
     I want to find a good way to save my life.
     I, a slave of him, have found the name “Nārāyaṇa”
     and I hold to him as my refuge.

956. The name “Nārāyaṇa” will give a good family
     to his devotees and remove all their troubles.

### 06. Naimeesāraṇyam (North India)

998. Before in my life, I wanted only to enjoy
     the small foreheads, round arms, beautiful breasts
     and shining moon-like smiles of lovely women.
     I understand now that I was weak and what I did was wrong.
     I am ashamed that I wanted to be with young women.
     I know this birth is a sickness
     and I do not want to be born again.
     O my father! You stay in Naimeesāraṇyam.
     I have approached your divine feet
     and you are my refuge.

999. I have always enjoyed women
     with long dark eyes, beautiful figures
     and feet ornamented with anklets.
     I forgot dharma, enjoyed the bliss that my five senses gave
     and wasted my life.
     Your generous hands give whatever your devotees ask of you.
     You are a cowherd. You are a Māyan.
     You are the king of the gods in the sky,
     and they worship you and ask your grace.
     O my father! You stay in Naimeesāraṇyam.
     I have approached your divine feet
     and you are my refuge.

1000. I gambled and stole things from others.
      I loved beautiful curly-headed women.
      I wandered all over wherever I wished and wasted my life.
      Now I have become your devotee and shiver when I think
      of the troubles that Yama’s messengers will bring.
      O lord who churned the milky ocean roaring with white waves,
      my father, you stay in Naimeesāraṇyam.
      I have approached your divine feet, my refuge.

1001. Someone may leave his wife
      with fragrant hair swarming with bees
      and love someone else’s wife and wealth
      and believe in that kind of life.
      When he dies and goes to Yama’s world,
      Yama’s messengers will tell him,
      “Embrace this burning copper doll, you sinner!”
      I am afraid of the thought that I will be like that.
      You are my friend.
      O my father! You stay in Naimeesāraṇyam.
      I have approached your divine feet
      and you are my refuge.

1002. When people suffering in poverty came to me
      and asked me, “Please give me a little bit of food,”
      I was unkind and told them cruelly,
      “No. I have no food!” and refused them.
      What a pity that was.
      I have not thought of the results of my bad deeds.
      I am afraid that when Yama’s messengers come for me,
      they will say cruel things and make me suffer.
      I shiver and have come to your divine feet.
      O father, you stay in Naimeesāraṇyam
      and you are my refuge.

1003. With a crooked mind I did evil things.
      I wandered around, associated with people like dogs,
      became weak, ran about and destroyed many lives.
      I didn’t feel bad at all.
      I didn’t think of what will happen to me in the world of Yama.
      O highest lord resting on the milky ocean,
      I searched for you and came to your divine feet.
      You are my refuge. You are my father
      and you stay in Naimeesāraṇyam.

1004. In my mind I thought only of unjust deeds
      and did them without any fear, speaking bad words.
      When I listened to the timeless advice of the elders, and sages, I trembled.
      I am a cheater, yet I am your slave.
      You, the god of the sky who are poison to the Rāksasas
      never leave the minds of your devotees.
      O my father, god of Naimeesāraṇyam,
      I have come to your divine feet and you are my refuge.

1005. Kali, the god of time,
      told the five senses to come to me
      and make me surrender to the pleasures they offered .
      Now I have been destroyed by the trouble that they cause me.
      You have the dark color of the wide ocean
      and stay in Thirukkuṛungudi.
      I have worshiped you with sweet words and flowers
      and praised you with my tongue.
      O my father, you stay in Naimeesāraṇyam,
      I have come to your divine feet and you are my refuge.

1006. This body is made of bones,
      covered with flesh, skin and hair that are like walls.
      It has nine openings and it is like a little hut.
      When I depart from this body,
      I will think only of you as my refuge.
      You are the beloved of the goddess Malarmagaḷ
      seated on a lotus dripping with honey
      and you rest with her on the wide ocean rolling with waves.
      I have done difficult tapas to reach you.
      O my father, you stay in Naimeesāraṇyam,
      I have come to your divine feet and you are my refuge.

1007. Kaliyan loved, worshiped and composed these pāsurams
      praising the god of Naimeesāraṇyam
      where Indra the king of the gods
      came with the other gods, worshiped our father
      and asked him to remove their troubles.
      If devotees learn and recite these ten poems
      they will rule the world surrounded by sounding oceans
      under a white umbrella and become gods.

### 17. Thiruviḍavendai

1108. Her mother says,
      “Even though my daughter with a lovely face
      as beautiful as the white shining moon
      knows that Lakshmi born in the milky ocean with its nectar
      stays on your chest, she does not stop loving you.
      She is as beautiful as the doll in the kolli hills
      and her lovely eyes are like kuvalai blossoms.
      She loves to worship your feet.
      What do you think of her in your heart,
      O father, lord of Thiruvidaventhai?”

1109. Her mother says,
      “My daughter doesn’t smile at her friends
      with her mouth as sweet as a pomagranate fruit.
      Her breasts are not smeared with sandal paste.
      Her waterlily eyes are not decorated with kohl.
      She doesn’t wear lovely fresh flowers in her hair.
      She just repeats the word “Thirumāl,”
      the name of him who measured the world
      surrounded by the abundant water of the ocean.
      What do you think of this lovely young girl,
      O father, lord of Thiruvidaventhai?”

1110. Her mother says,
      “If my daughter wears sandal paste and pearl garlands
      on her round breasts, they burn her.
      The white moon that rises in the evening
      sheds hot rays and makes her weak.
      When she hears the sound of the roaring waves
      of the ocean she prattles and prattles,
      her beautiful body that has the color of a mango shoot becomes pale
      and her bangles grow loose and fall from her hands.
      What do you think of that beautiful girl
      decorated with precious ornaments,
      O father, lord of Thiruvidaventhai?”

1111. Her mother says,
      “My poor daughter says that one nazihai is longer than an eon.
      She asks her friends,
      ‘When will this bright sun go to sleep?
      Why does the ocean grieve?
      Why doesn’t the andril bird sleep?
      The breeze is more cruel than fire for me.
      Both my breasts hurt.
      You are my friends. Tell me what I can say.’
      What do you think of my daughter as precious as gold,
      O father, lord of Thiruvidaventhai?”

1112. Her mother says,
      “My daughter doesn’t say anything at all except your name.
      She melts whenever she thinks of your divine form.
      Her love for you keeps growing and making her suffer.
      She thinks only of you and can’t do anything else.
      Her long fish-like eyes can’t close in sleep.
      I am innocent myself, but I can’t bear the childishness of my daughter.
      My girl, her waist as thin as a vine, is really in love with you.
      Now people are gossiping about her—can you help her,
      O father, lord of Thiruvidaventhai?” ”

1113. Her mother says,
      “My daughter doesn’t think of any of the things
      that she should do for her own family.
      When she heard the words that the god she loves
      destroyed the strong clan of the Rakshasas in Lanka
      surrounded with strong forts and the wide ocean,
      she was happy. She is fascinated with you.
      Her soft breasts are pale as gold and her waist is like a thin vine.
      Can’t you think of doing something to help her,
      O father, lord of Thiruvidaventhai?”

1114. Her mother says,
      “When my daughter thinks of you, her heart melts
      and she prattles on about you. She only loves you.
      She doesn’t feel any affection for me, her mother.
      She prattles and says,
      ‘You are the Mayan, you stay in Thirumalirunjolai
      surrounded by groves where sweet fruits ripen.’
      Her smile is sweet as a kalam fruit.
      Her mind worries always and she feels weak.
      What do you think you can do for her, sweet as a fresh fruit,
      O father, lord of Thiruvidaventhai?”

      because we want to see you.
      Won’t we be saved if you show yourself to us?

      ‘O Venkaṭam, O Venkaṭam!’
      She refuses to come and lie on my lap.
      She forgets to sleep closing her long sword-like eyes.
      What did the beloved of Lakshmi,
      born in the milky ocean, do to my daughter?
      The precious god with the beautiful dark color of a bee or a cloud
      lies on Adisesha on the ocean with rolling waves.
      He is life for the gods in the sky.
      What has he done to my daughter?
      I never thought she would be upset like this.”

1389. Her mother says,
      “My daughter’s dress has become loose around her waist.
      The bangles on her hand slide down.
      She says to the god, ‘I am your slave.
      Will you sell me to others?
      Will you keep me as your slave or will you not?’
      He, the god of the Thiruvenkaṭam hills,
      the chief of the gods in the sky,
      destroyed the seven mara trees with his bow
      and conquered the Asurans.
      See what he has done to my daughter!
      I never thought this could happen.”

1390. Her mother says,
      “O friends, my daughter has the soft eyes of a doe.
      Her long sword-like eyes are filled with tears.
      Her bangles are growing loose.
      She is always talking about the beauty
      of his fragrant thulasi garland that drips honey and she doesn’t sleep.
      He, the son of Nandagopan, is a cowherd and wanders in the forest.
      He enters guarded houses, steals yogurt and butter and eats them.
      See what he has done to my daughter!
      I don’t understand.”

1391. Her mother says,
      “My daughter doesn’t listen to me, her mother.
      She doesn’t play with her friends.
      She doesn’t decorate her round soft breasts with sandal paste.
      She keeps asking, ‘Where is Thiruvarangam of my lord?’
      He, the Māyan, drank milk from the breasts of Putanā, the devil,
      and swallowed the whole earth into his large stomach.
      O friends, I can’t describe all the trouble he has given to my daughter.
      There is no limit to it.”

1392. Her mother says,
      “She doesn’t decorate her breasts with sandal paste.
      She doesn’t put kohl on her eyes that are like fighting fish.
      She doesn’t want to play with her puvai bird.
      She doesn’t want anything.
      She keeps asking,
      ‘Where is Thiruvarangam of my lord?’
      We know that he, our Nambi, the beloved of Lakshmi,
      was raised in a cowherd village.
      O friends, he is a strong man.
      I don’t know what he has done to my daughter.”

1393. Her mother says,
      “She keeps saying,
      ‘Won’t he give me his beautiful fresh pollen-filled garland?’
      She wants it so much she grows weak.
      See, if I say something she only answers,
      ‘Thiruvarangam of my lord.’
      He, the beloved of the goddess Lakshmi, danced on a pot.
      He killed the Asuran Madhu
      and he went as a messenger for the Pandava kings.
      How can I describe the trouble he has given to my daughter?”

1394. Her mother says,
      “She doesn’t worry that her young breasts
      circled with a band have become pale.
      If she begins to say anything, she only repeats
      the divine names of the highest god.
      She is the daughter I gave birth to. What can I do?
      He is decorated with garlands and rules beautiful Kuḍandai.
      He became the charioteer for the Pandavas in the war.
      How can I describe all the trouble he has given to my daughter?”

1395. Her mother says,
      “Many people gossip about her.
      They say she doesn’t want to have any connection with her family.
      She doesn’t forget to say always,
      ‘You are the Māyavan. You are Madhavan.’
      Generous and without births,
      he, the beloved of young girls, the virtuous king of the earth,
      gives all the boons that the gods in the sky ask for.
      O friends, I don’t understand what he has done to my daughter.”

1396. Her mother says,
      “She doesn’t want to play with balls and molucca beans.
      She doesn’t want to feed milk to her parrot.
      She doesn’t want to carry her doll.
      She grows tired as she keeps saying,
      ‘Did the god of Thiruvarangam come to me? Won’t he come to me?’
      and her bangles grow loose.
      He is praised by the Chandogya Upanishad and the Rig Veda
      and worshiped by the sages who make sacrifices with five types of fire.
      He is praised in the Taittiriya Upanishad and in the Sāma Veda.
      O my dear ones, he came to see my daughter
      and I don’t know what he has done to her.

1397. Kaliyan with a sharp spear, who is Yama for his enemies,
      composed ten Tamil poems about how a mother
      worries about her beautiful daughter with eyes like neelam flowers
      because she fell in love with the god of Thiruvarangam
      surrounded by fields where fish frolic.
      If devotees learn and recite these ten pāsurams,
      they will rule this earth under a royal umbrella decorated with pearl garlands
      and go and live in the golden world of heaven.

      I saw him only in Thennarangam.

1403. In Thennarangam I saw the lord
      who is the Karpaga tree that gives whatever one wants,

      and went to the battle field riding on his winged garuḍa,
      to fight with angry Shiva and his son Karthikeya
      and his escort to help Vānāsuran in the battle,
      and made them all retreat from the battlefield. ??

1403. He killed Kamsan and he swallowed the earth and spit it out.
      When angry Shiva came with his son Karthikeya
      and his escort to help Vānāsuran in the battle
      the lord riding on his lovely-winged eagle
      fought with them and made them all retreat from the battlefield.
      He is the Karpaga tree that gives whatever anyone wants,
      and the path of tapas for those who have controlled their anger.
      I saw him in Thennarangam.

1404. Devotees think only of Thirumal who is the path of tapas always
      and he has come to me and abides in my mind.
      The lord who measured the world and the sky with his two feet
      stays in the Thiruvenkaṭam hills
      and in Thirukkovalur surrounded by groves
      blooming with bunches of flowers.
      He is faultless and I saw him in Thennarangam.

1405. I saw the highest lord in Thennarangam
      who does not give his grace
      to Buddhists with their orange clothes or to dirty Jains
      and only gives his grace to the devotees who approach him,
      my relatives, me, my father, my mother
      and the gods in the sky.

1406. I saw the dark cloud-colored lord of Thennarangam,
      a shining emerald, who has removed my false thoughts
      and makes me control my mind.
      If people think of his true form,
      the clever lord is truth for them.

1407. Kaliyan the famous poet composed ten musical Tamil pāsurams
      praising the god of beautiful Thennarangam who lovingly grazed cows.
      If devotees learn and recite these ten famous pāsurams well
      the results of their bad karma will not come to them.

      and even told him that your wife, the innocent doe-eyed Sita,
      was his sister-in-law and that your brother Lakshmaṇa was his brother.

      and your kindness was immeasurable, larger than the ocean.

      and are more skilled than the gods in the sky from the ancient times,
      in all the four Vedas, the five sacrifices and the six Upanishads.

1446. If devotees obey his commands
      they become like boats that never overturn even in a flood

### 52. Thiruviṇṇagaram

1458. Before I wanted wealth
      and the pleasures that the five senses gave.
      Even though I was hurt again and again,
      I did not stop enjoying those pleasures.
      I was friendly with people I liked
      and I hated those I did not like.
      Now, I have come to understand
      that those pleasures were evil
      and I have removed them from my mind.
      O lord of Thiruviṇṇagar,
      now I hate the deeds I did and I come to you, my refuge.

1459. You, the highest, embrace Lakshmi on your chest.
      I forgot you in all my births
      and until now never thought of you in my heart.

      again and again and I am weak,
      but I have become your good devotee.
      O god of Thiruvinnagar,
      I come to your feet—you are my refuge.

1460. You are the sky, the earth, and honey.
      You came to me, entered my heart and remained there.
      I stayed in the womb of doe-eyed women
      and I stayed in this body made of flesh
      and I realized that births and this body
      will not give me heaven.
      O god of Thiruvinnagar,
      I come to you—you are my refuge.

1461. I left my wife and children
      realizing that they cannot help me attain moksha.
      Through your grace I threw away pleasures
      to rid myself of the troubles that my five senses gave
      that shine like swords.
      I come to you and worship your feet.
      O god of Thiruvinnagar, I am your slave. You are my refuge.

      and were praised with “pallaṇḍu” by women

      and I come to you and worship your feet.
      O god of Thiruvinnagar,
      I am your slave. You are my refuge.

1463. I do not want to do the things
      that my five unknowing senses want.

      and the Asurans and defeated them
      and you shot your arrows and destroyed Lanka
      surrounded by wide oceans and strong forts.
      I come to you and worship your feet,
      O god of Thiruviṇṇagar. I am your slave. You are my refuge.

      "O faultless god of the gods
      with the lovely color of a precious jewel who know everything,
      my daughter worships Kaṇṇapuram

      where the bright moon shines and looks around
      and points to Kaṇṇapuram and says, ‘See that!’

      where Kaṇṇan stays.
      When she says, ‘I am a girl and I love the god,’
      she is telling the truth.
      Perhaps if she hears someone tell her how he stole and ate butter
      and how Yashoda tied him to a mortar,
      the pallid color of her body will change back to normal.”

1663. “My daughter says, ‘I came to Thirukaṇṇapuram
      from Thirumalai in the north to be with the lord.’

      or sees the cool moon that shines bright she feels distress.

      of the Asuran when he came as a horse.”

1665. “All devotees go to Thirukkaṇṇapuram
      to worship your feet and you protect them.
      My daughter sees that and wants to go there and worship you.
      The jewel-like body of my innocent daughter
      with hair that swarms with bees has grown pale.
      Do you think it is right to make her suffer like this?”

1666. “My daughter does not have all her teeth yet.
      Her hair has not yet grown thick
      and you can’t say that she understands things. What can I do?

      filled with groves blooming with flowers that drip honey.
      How can I think this child is really innocent?”

      and there is no light to be seen anywhere in the night.
      I don’t know what to do.”


1690. She says,
      “The bangles on my arms have grown loose and fallen.
      Is this because of the magic of that cowherd
      who drank the milk of the female devil when he was a child?

      The rays of the pure beautiful moon burn me, and I have no one to help.

      The day is gone. O friend, what can we do?

      The sun sets over the deep ocean in the evening
      and my life plunges into the pain of love and kills me.”

      My long eyes do not close and this dark night is longer than an eon.
      When will it pass? I do not know.”

1694. She says,
      “Our dear lord who built a bridge, crossed the ocean,
      fought with Rāvaṇa the king of Lanka
      in a terrible war and terrified the Rākshasas

      The hot shining sun, the crescent moon

      The male bird with beautiful wings embraces his mate
      shivering in the terrible dew dripping everywhere.
      Is there anything more cruel than the loneliness I have on this dark night?
      I don’t know what bad karma I must have done to suffer like this.
      The young god I love so much has not come.”

1696. She says,
      “I had a dream that the god of Thirukkaṇṇapuram
      surrounded with strong walls
      came to me and made my heart joyful.
      When I think of it my bangles grow loose.
      Now it is night!
      The sound of the small bells of the bulls pains my heart
      and the sorrowful sound of the andril bird keeps me awake and kills me.
      I must have done much bad karma.”

1697. Kaliyan the chief of Thirumangai
      surrounded by beautiful cloud-covered groves
      composed pāsurams describing the love pain
      of a young woman whose soft breasts are tied with a band,

      loved me and left me, leaving me to suffer.
      He cheated me and I shouldn’t love him.
      He is the god ofThirupullani, filled with salt pans and streams of water
      where happy bees sing in the cool flourishing groves
      and their music spreads on the banks of the ocean that smell with fish.
      Come, let us go and worship him there.”

1776. She says,
      “O dear friend, let us fold our hands and praise his names,
      placing beautiful bright flowers on his feet and worshiping him.

      Let us love him—that is enough.
      Come, let us go to Thiruppullāṇi and worship him.”

1778. She says,
      “ The sorrowful calling of the andril bird
      that stays on the long branch of the palm tree in the grove
      is more cruel than the pain of a spear making a wound.
      I fold my hands and worship the lord of Thiruppullāṇi
      where the fragrance of the flowers spreads everywhere.
      O my friend beautiful as a statue!
      Do you think this worship will become a habit for us?”

1779. She says,
      “As a dwarf, he, the king, measured the whole world,
      and as a swan he taught the Vedas to the sages.
      I fell in love with him and my body became pale.
      O birds, you live in the golden-colored salt pans on the banks of the ocean.
      Go and tell the lord of Thiruppullāṇi of my love for him.”

1780. She says,
      “My lonely heart went everywhere searching for him
      who is adorned with a thulasi garland.
      Has it lost its way?
      I fold my hands and worship him in Thiruppullāṇi
      where the waves of the sea crash on the shore.
      Go and tell him how I suffer with my love for him.
      Why does he stand silently like a divine statue.”

1781. She says,
      “He came as a man-lion and split open the chest
      of the strong Hiranyan with his claws.
      Will he give his grace to us?
      I fold my hands and worship him
      in Thiruppullaṇi where the dashing waves roll.
      My flower-like eyes are filled with tears
      and my garment has grown loose and doesn’t stay around my waist.”

1782. She says,
      “ My heart has gone to the strong archer Rama
      who shot his arrows in battle in Lanka and killed the Rākshasas.
      Even if everyone scolds me and gossips about me,
      I will stay here believing the lies
      that my dear lord of Thiruppullāṇi told me
      until my heart returns.”

1783. She says, “The hot shining sun goes on his chariot,
      wanders all day and sets in the evening.
      My heart burns cruelly, paining me all day in the heat.
      I fold my hands and worship him in Thiruppullāṇi
      surrounded with blooming groves and flourishing ponds.
      I have lost my beautiful color and my conch bangles.”

1784. She says,
      “The sound of thunder and the ringing of the cowbells
      never cease, burning me even more than fire.
      I fold my hands and worship him in Thiruppullāṇi
      filled with beautiful jewel-studded palaces.
      I have done bad karma.
      The wind from the ocean blows hot on me.”

1785. She says,
      “He broke the tusks of the hollow-trunked elephant
      and rests on Adisesha on a snake bed and gives his grace to us.
      I fold my hands and worship him in Thiruppullāṇi
      where the cherundi trees shower golden flowers.
      The crescent moon with its mark sheds hot fire on me.”

1786. She says,
      “He, the ancient god who is the Vedas, the sky,
      the sun and the moon gives his grace to us.
      I fold my hands and worship him in Thiruppullāṇi
      surrounded with punnai trees blooming with opening buds.
      I and the waves of the ocean do not sleep.”

1787. Kaliyan, the poet with strong mountain-like arms,
      composed pāsurams describing how a girl with a waist like lightning
      loves our father, the lord of Thiruppullāṇi
      surrounded with punnai trees blooming with golden flowers.

      I cannot sleep at night when dew falls.
      He has taken over all my five senses
      but doesn’t feel pity for me.
      I am just a girl soft as a creeper.

      where he with the dark color of a kuvalai flower stays
      and leave me there.”

1789. She says,
      “The cool wind that blows from the jasmine flowers dripping with pollen
      and the cool crescent moon together take my life.
      I cannot sleep even for one night.
      If the ignorant women adorned with bangles on their hands are able to sleep,
      let them gossip about me as they wish.
      On his chest, the lord of Thirukkuṛnguḍi embraces Lakshmi
      whose hair is adorned with fragrant flowers. .
      Take me there and leave me.”

1790. She says,
      “The morning brings me the pain of love just like the evening,
      and the night only makes it greater, lasting as long as an eon.
      If I try to describe the cold wind
      I can only say it hurts me like a rising fire.
      There are many tricks that the beautiful sapphire-colored Thirumāl can do.
      Before he does something and hurts me,
      take me to Thirukkuṛunguḍi
      filled with forests where beautiful peacocks dance.”

1791. She says,
      “The sound of the bells on the dark necks of the bulls
      that wander with their white cows hurts my heart
      and I cannot sleep even one night.
      The generous lord stays in Thirukkuṛunguḍi
      where the fields flourish with water
      and the gods adorned with precious jewels praise his wonderful grace.
      Take me where he is.”

1792. She says, “In the evening I hear the bells on the necks of the bulls
      and the sweet music of the flute of the cowherds.
      The breeze blows and the crescent moon shines.
      They were always harmless before
      but now they all join together and hurt me.
      I have done bad karma.
      Take me and leave me in Thirukuṛunguḍi
      where the lustrous cloud-colored lord stays.”

1793. She says,
      “Girls ornamented with beautiful jewels
      gossip about me night and day.
      Let them do what they want. I am not worried.
      They are good people—I don’t know what is wrong with them.
      I am not shy, naive or afraid.
      They may make themselves happy saying things about me,
      but I won’t forget the sapphire-colored lord.
      Take me and leave me in Thirukkuṛunguḍi
      where soft mullai blossoms bloom luxuriantly
      in the backyards of the houses.”

1794. She says,
      “A tall dark god with beautiful eyes entered here.
      He made my body weak and my bangles loose.
      I wonder, ‘Why is this happening to me?’
      The tricks of Kāma who carries a bow
      with five flower arrows make me suffer from love.
      I didn’t understand that.
      Take me and leave me in Thirukkuṛunguḍi
      surrounded with forests and cool fields
      blooming with flowers that drip honey.”

1795. She says,
      “Listen, it is not only the sound of the ocean that hurts me,
      or the hands that are like ambal flowers
      of the cowherd that come and pain my life.
      Kāma may come and shoot his five flower arrows at me.
      Before that happens,
      find out what the dancer, the cowherd, thinks
      and take me and leave me in Thirukkuṛunguḍi.”

1796. She says,
      “Even though I praised him and worshiped him, he doesn’t take pity on me.
      He took my chastity, gave me golden clothes to cover myself
      and left, I don’t know where.
      My breasts have grown out but they are no use
      because he doesn’t embrace me.
      He, a dancer and king of the gods,
      wishes to stay in Thirukuṛunguḍi.
      Take me there and leave me where he is.”

1797. She says,
      “The god of the gods who keeps the goddess Lakshmi with him,
      the generous lord who destroyed southern Lanka,
      entered the heart and the eyes of famous Kaliyan
      who composed pāsurams that praise the victorious god,
      ruler of the whole world.

### 92. Thaḍampongat tam pongo

1858. “Our king was not compassionate and did evil things.
      Now the result of those evil deeds gives us pain,
      but what is the use of our saying this now.
      Ravaṇan, our king, was killed.
      What can we tell about him to others?
      O chiefs of the monkeys, O young prince!
      O lord Rama, with your strong beautiful bow,
      we are Rākshasas but you have conquered us.
      Our Rākshasas worry about joining the group of dancers and dancing.
      We are afraid of you. Thaḍam pongaththam pongo!”

1859. “Ravaṇan our king with ten heads
      and twenty mighty arms lost his life and kingdom because he was attracted to Sita.
      We are his slaves and do not know what to do.
      You have two arms and wear one crown.
      We didn't know whom we should serve.
      O, lord, you are our god. Do not kill us.
      We are afraid of you. Thaḍam pongaththam pongo!”

1860. “Our king Ravaṇan with evil intentions
      entered the forest of Daṇḍakāraṇyam,
      kidnapped Sita and destroyed himself.
      We haven't done anything wrong.
      O Rama, you are the best of your dynasty! Do not kill us.
      What can we say about this kingdom
      that has been destroyed because of a woman?
      O son of Dasaratha, you did everything to make the gods in the sky happy.
      We are afraid of you. Thaḍam pongaththam pongo!”

1861. “The faultless Vibhisaṇan, Rāvaṇaṇ’s brother,
      bowed to our king of Lanka and told him, ‘You are our brother.
      If you keep Sita, she will be poison for the Rakshasa tribe.
      We will be destroyed because of the boon
      that the gods in the sky received from Rama.
      Let him go back with the lovely-haired Sita,
      beautiful as a peacock in a grove dripping with honey.’
      We are afraid of you. Taḍam pongaththam pongo!”

1862. “Our king Ravaṇan adorned with golden crowns
      kidnapped the goddess Sita and imprisoned her
      in a fragrant garden swarming with bees.
      See, this was wrong.
      Kumbakarṇan and Nikumban have been killed in battle.
      Yama came in the form of a man and killed us with arrows.
      We are afraid. Taḍam pongaththam pongo!”

1863. “The monkey Hanuman, your messenger,
      crossed the roaring ocean
      and destroyed beautiful Lanka and our dear families and relatives.
      He burned our Lanka guarded with forts.
      Our king did not give back the divine Sita
      to his messenger the heroic monkey Hanuman
      and now we suffer because of that. Alas!
      We are afraid. Taḍam pongaththam pongo!”

1864. “You have the color of a precious jewel!
      Our poor Rāvaṇa, king of Lanka,
      could not forget the beautiful thin-waisted Sita
      with a glance soft as a doe’s.
      He thought he could not even live without her.
      Rāvaṇa, our chief of Lanka, is pitiful!
      Kill only the king of Lanka and leave us.
      O sapphire-colored lord,
      we come here all together and bow to you.
      We have told you what we want.
      Taḍam pongaththam pongo!”

1865. “Rāvaṇa had many fish-eyed soft-breasted wives in Lanka.
      Among them was Mandodari who loved him
      but he was not attracted to any of them—
      he thought Rama and his people were only sages wandering in the forest.
      He kidnapped Sita, as beautiful as a forest peacock,
      and kept her in Lanka, and Rama, handsome as Kāma,
      shot arrows with his strong arms into the chest of terrible Ravaṇa.
      We are afraid. Taḍam pongaththam pongo!”

1866. “Shiva shot his arrows
      and burned the three forts in the blink of an eye.
      Like Shiva, Sambhavan shot cruel arrows and killed the Rākshasas.
      We bow to you. Have pity on us.
      You are our father, our lord.
      O, Sugriva, you are the son of the hot, shining sun.
      You are the king of the monkeys.
      Do not kill us. We bow to you.
      Taḍam pongaththam pongo!”

1867. Kaliyan the strong one, composed pāsurams
      on Rama who destroyed beautiful Lanka
      to relieve the affliction of the gods in the sky.
      O devotees, if you sing “Taḍam pongaththam pongo!” and dance,
      there will be no troubles for you in this birth,
      and if you go away from this world, you will go only to heaven.
      Let us sing, “Thadam pongaththam pongo!”

### 93. Kuzhamaṇi thuram - The Rākshasas sing and dance

1868. “We praise the divine name of Rama.
      O Nampi, we bow to you, O Sugriva, we worship you.
      Protect us, tell your monkey army not to hurt us.
      We dance like dancers of the kuthu dance.
      Kuzhamaṇi thuurame!”

1869. “Indrajit did not praise the name of the god.
      He said, ‘Our dear king, take care me.’
      He could not fight with Rama and was killed by Rama’s arrows.
      O Nambi Hanuman! Sugriva! Angada! Naḷa!
      Kumbhakarna lost and was killed in the war.
      Kuzhamaṇi thuurame!”

1870. “O Rama! You came to the earth
      as a Yama for our king Ravaṇa, the ruler of Lanka.
      May the dark cloud-like Neelan live long!
      May Susheṇan live long.
      May Angadan live long.
      We praise all of you and dance beautifully.
      Kuzhamaṇi thuurame!”

1871. “Evil-minded Ravaṇa desired fragrant-haired Sita
      and Rama killed him.
      We praise the younger brother of Rama, Lakshmaṇa,
      valorous in victory, who killed the Rākshasas
      by bending his bow and leaving them for the ghouls
      on the battlefield to eat.
      Kuzhamaṇi thuurame!”

1872. “We lost the war and do not need any honor.
      Give us your grace today and our lives.
      You are our lords and relatives.
      Look at us. Do not kill us.
      We are big as mountains, and we dance for you.
      Kuzhamaṇi thuurame!”

1873. “Your king constructed a bridge of stones across the ocean,
      went past all our guards and came to Lanka, afflicting us.
      We could not fight and conquer him. We are afraid of him.
      You are the son of hot sun.
      Do not kill us. We dance for you and ask your grace.
      Kuzhamaṇi thuurame!”

1874. “O Rākshasas, come,
      give up your thoughts of fighting with the monkeys.
      If you want Rama and the others not to be angry with you
      do not speak heroic words.
      Heroic Hanuman has an ancient birth—let us praise him.
      Let us dance so that the monkey heroes
      who are as strong as Yama’s messengers can see us.
      Kuzhamaṇi thuurame!”

1875. “The monkey army of Rama,
      after wearing us down and conquering us,
      should not kill our elephants that eat so well
      or our galloping horses.
      They should not destroy our chariots or the Rākshasas.
      Let the dark kuvalai-colored Rama, the king of Ayodhya
      surrounded with tall coral-studded palaces see us.
      Let us dance. Kuzhamaṇi thuurame!”

1876. “Our king Ravaṇa carried a long spear
      with a leaf-shaped blade and ran from the battlefield.
      We wanted to survive and have come to you.
      We will not fight with your king or with all of you.
      Together as a group we dance. Kuzhamaṇi thuurame!”

1877. Kaliyan with a spear smeared with oil
      composed a garland of ten musical pāsurams
      in which the mountain-like Rakshasas
      exclaimed, “kuzhamaṇi thuuram”
      after fighting a cruel war in famed ancient Lanka
      with Rama and the monkeys.
      Sing these ten pāsurams and dance.

1878. Run and come happily as fragrant flowers
      fall from your beautiful hair
      and put your mouth on my breasts,
      hold them and drink milk.
      O Nambi, son of Nandan,
      you are my nectar and I enjoy you.
      You are my father and my lord. Come and drink my sweet milk.

1879. O Nambi, colored like the ocean with rolling waves
      and like a dark cloud,
      you are tall and precious, with lovely eyes,
      and your mouth is red like a beautiful lotus.
      Milk is coming from my breasts.
      I called you loudly but I have not seen you.
      Where are you? Are you playing with the cowherd children?

1880. O Nambi, as you play happily on the street
      with the rich, handsome cowherd children
      my heart melts seeing your naughty play
      and milk spills from my breasts onto the ground.
      Come embrace me, sit on my lap and drink milk.

1881. When people look at you
      they think that you are the result of the tapas
      that all women have ever done.
      You, the first one of the world,are strong as a rutting elephant.
      I will catch the crescent moon in the red evening sky
      and give it in your hands.
      O dear one, come and sit on my lap
      and drink milk happily.

1882. My son with hair dark as kohl,
      you walked between the marudu trees and destroyed the Asuras.
      O clever one, you steal and swallow butter.
      Do not be in a hurry.
      The milk from my breasts doesn’t want to wait.
      O good one who measured the world,
      come and drink my milk, come and drink my milk.

1883. You are not a good child
      if you do what other naughty children do.
      You speak more cleverly than others
      and like a thief you do many naughty deeds
      making my heart melt as I see you.
      Milk is spilling from my breasts.
      Don’t pretend you are sleepy.
      Come and drink milk.

1884. When Putana, the devil woman, came as a mother
      and fed you the milk from her breasts,
      O Nambi, you drank her poisonous milk and killed her.
      You are the beloved of earth goddess
      and of beautiful Nappinnai, daughter of a cowherd.
      My son, drink milk. Come and eat your food.

1885. If I hit you with the stick I’m holding,
      your relatives will be angry with me.
      I am worried but I won’t hurt you.
      When the cows return home,
      the gods in the sky will see them.
      Don’t stand in the street in the evening,
      O lord with a discus in your hands.
      Come to me and eat your food.

1886. You, great as an elephant,
      the son of the generous Nandan,
      the chief of the cowherds,
      are a prince among your relatives,
      famous from ancient times.
      You graze the cows every day in the forest.
      Why haven’t you come to eat food before this?

1887. Kaliyan, the poet with handsome heroic arms
      composed ten divine pāsurams on the lovely-eyed Neḍumal.
      If devotees learn and recite these ten pāsurams
      that describe how Yashoda called Kaṇṇan to come and eat
      and if they worship the true god,
      they will go to heaven and be with the gods.

1888. When you ate the butter that Yashoda the cowherdess
      with hair adorned with beautiful flowers churned and kept,

      when she came to you
      but without anyone to help you, you approached her

### 96. The cowherd women tied Kaṇṇan with a rope when he stole butter.

1898. Is there a māyam like this?
      The lord Nārāyaṇan came to the earth as a man
      and taught the Vedas to the sages
      so that the Vedas would not disappear.
      With his golden throat he swallowed
      the hot sun, earth, rising oceans, mountains and fire
      and kept them in his stomach.
      See, now he has stolen butter
      and the cowherd women have caught him and tied him up
      and he cannot move.

1899. The lord who churned the sounding milky ocean
      using Mandara mountain for a churning stick
      shot with a sling at the Kuni’s back, making it bend,
      and then shot again and straightened it.
      He swallowed the ancient seven worlds, the seven mountains
      and the seven oceans where fish swim and kept them in his stomach.
      See, now he has stolen butter
      and the cowherd women have caught him and tied him up
      and he cannot move.

1900. When the gods in the sky were worried
      that the Asuran Madhukaiṭabha had become a terrible enemy
      and that he would fight them,
      they went to the god who carries a bent bow,
      worshiped him and asked for his help
      and our dear lord destroyed the Asuran and saved them.
      With his sharp claws he split open
      the mountain-like body of the Asuran Hiraṇyaṇ with sword-like teeth.

      and he cannot move.

1901. When the gods in the sky grew tired
      fighting with their enemy Hiraṇyan and went to the god
      and asked him for refuge, our god Thirumāl
      split open the chest of Hiraṇyan
      and joyfully gave his grace to the gods in the sky.
      He went as a dwarf to the famous heroic king Mahābali,
      cheated him, took his land
      and measured the earth and the sky with his two feet.
      See, now he has stolen the butter
      and the cowherd women have caught him and tied him up
      and he cannot move.

1902. Wishing to remove the troubles of the gods,
      he went as a dwarf to Mahābali’s sacrifice,
      grew tall and measured the earth and the sky.
      He, the ruler of all the seven worlds,
      gives his grace to his devotees and protects them
      so that the messengers of Yama will not approach them.
      See, now he has stolen the butter
      and the cowherd women have caught him and tied him up
      and he cannot move.

1903. Our divine lord Thirumāl,
      who protects his devotees
      and removes the desires of evil passions for them if they worship him,
      cut off with his mazhu weapon the thousand arms of the angry Asuran Kārtaviryan
      when he came to fight with him.
      See, now he has stolen the butter
      and the cowherd women have caught him and tied him up
      and he cannot move.

1904. Our lord, the creator of the world
      who removes the sorrows of his devotees if they worship him
      gathered a monkey army, built a bridge over the ocean with stones,
      crossed it and destroyed his enemies in Lanka
      because the Rakshasas did not understand his strength.
      See, now he has stolen the butter
      and the cowherd women have caught him and tied him up
      and he cannot move.

1905. As Rama, the lord broke the bow that was born with Sita,
      and he married her who had precious ornaments and curly soft hair.
      When he was living happily with her as a prince,
      she was abducted by Ravaṇa, the king of Lanka.
      He built a bridge, crossed the ocean, fought with Rāvaṇa,
      cut off his ten strong heads and his arms and legs
      and brought his wife back.
      See, now he has stolen the butter
      and the cowherd women have caught him and tied him up
      and he cannot move.

1906. When the Asuran Kesi came as a tawny horse,
      he split open his mouth and killed him,

      and he cut off the nose and ears of the Raksasi Surpanakha
      who was as large as a mountain.
      See, now he has stolen butter
      and the cowherd women have caught him and tied him up
      and he cannot move.

1907. Kaliyan, the chief of ancient Thirumangai
      surrounded with flourishing fields,
      composed a garland of Tamil pāsurams
      worshiping the feet of the lord and describing his deeds,
      how he was tied to a mortar by the cowherd women
      when he stole milk, yogurt and ghee from the uṛi,
      swallowed them and filled his stomach,
      and how even when the cowherd women saw him,
      he was not worried and did not feel shy.
      If devotees learn and recite these pāsurams
      they will have no troubles in their lives and will find happiness.
      They will reach the heaven that is above even the world of the gods.

### 97. Churning yogurt

1908. Yashoda says,
      “Our cowherd clan is respected by all.
      If my son does something wrong,
      I can only upbraid him gently, saying,
      ‘You shouldn’t hurt other children.’
      I can’t scold him.
      His father Nandan won’t say anything either.
      O young friend, what can I do?
      It seems he goes to the corner house on this street
      to churn yogurt with a young girl.”

1909. A cowherdess says,
      “O dear Yashoda! I got up early
      and went to sell the churned buttermilk,
      looking for people to buy it,
      but I didn’t see anyone except the son of Nandan
      with hair that was decorated with fragrant flowers.
      Come and look, my beautiful friend
      from the last house on the street.
      I don’t see the butter and the ten pots of milk that I had,
      and I’m worried.
      What should I do? What should I do?”

1910. A cowherd woman says,
      “O lovely Yashoda,
      he is a little boy and he smiles sweetly.
      I keep a pot full of butter in the uri,
      but he has grabbed and swallowed it all,
      as much as a silver hill.
      He is a thief. Come and see him as he sleeps.
      All his hands are smeared with butter.
      His stomach is big enough to hold all the seven worlds,
      so it isn’t hard for him to keep all that butter in his stomach.
      I am ignorant! What can I do? What can I do?”

1911. A cowherd woman says,
      “Balaraman was born to a mother
      with spear-like eyes that were darkened with kohl.
      He and his brother Kaṇṇan were raised in the cowherd village together,
      but he doesn’t do naughty things like Kaṇṇan.
      Kaṇṇan tells lies, steals things
      and crawls and acts as if he knew nothing about it.
      Is he really a sweet child?
      We cowherd women cannot escape his tricks.
      What can I do? What can I do? ”

1912. A cowherd woman says,
      “One day before his father had returned,
      when I wasn’t at home and my friends weren’t around,
      he went near where my girl was playing,
      her fragrant hair decorated with beautiful flowers,
      and grabbed the ball she was playing with
      and took her clothes and did naughty things.
      What wrong have we done to Nandan’s son?
      O, friend, what can I do? What can I do?”

1913. A cowherdess says,
      “ O Yashoda, our lord who was carried to our cowherd village
      by his father Nandan at night when he was a child
      is the beloved of Lakshmi and of the earth goddess.
      He plays a bamboo flute and my daughter loves him.
      Her flower-like eyes are weary, her breasts are round,
      and her lotus-red mouth has grown pale.
      O beautiful friend, come and see how my daughter suffers.
      What can I do? What can I do?”

1914. A cowherd woman says,
      “The cowherds celebrated a festival
      and offered many kinds of food for the thousand-eyed Indra.
      O friend Yashoda, your son, disguised as a bhudam,
      went there today and grabbed all the food and ate it.
      See, it seems he is the Māyan
      who took all the food and swallowed it.”

1915. Yashoda says,
      “The cowherd women got together and called me.
      They said, ‘See, we kept the fermented yogurt,
      fragrant ghee and milk in various pots,
      but they are all empty now.’
      I felt ashamed and told my friends,
      ‘He is my dear lord!
      I can only plead with him not to do these naughty things,
      I can’t scold him.
      How could I scold my child
      who drank milk from the devil Putana and killed her?
      I am afraid of scolding him.’”

1916. Yashoda says,
      “Seven months after my dear son was born,
      when I had put my strong, matchless child
      to sleep on a bed soft as a flower
      and gone to bathe in the Yamuna river,
      he killed Sakaṭāsuran with his divine feet
      when he came as a cart that was large as a mountain.
      He rests on Adisesha on the ocean
      and Lakshmi stays on his faultless chest.
      I am afraid of scolding him after he did such a heroic deed.”

1917. Yashoda says,
      “O beautiful friends, I am afraid even of calling him by name.
      Even if the young children with soft, cotton-like feet
      eat a thousand measures of ghee,
      my friends, their mothers, do not scold them.
      You are the best among men!
      You killed Kamsan, the terrible Asuran
      on the day I was supposed to pay him money
      for the loan I took from him.
      I am not as strong as you, O Nambi.
      Do whatever you want.
      What can I do? What can I do?”

1918. Yashoda says to Kaṇṇan,
      “ O lovely one! How could you do these naughty things?
      O Nambi, you hid and went behind the beautiful cowherd girls
      when they bathed in the pond where lotuses bloom
      and stole their fine clothes and climbed up a tree.
      When the lovely-waisted girls begged you for their clothes,
      you said, ‘Come, beautiful ones, come and take them from me,’
      and you stayed in the tree.”

1919. Yashoda says,
      “This child has no fear,
      even to the extent of a tiny millet seed.
      I raised him with manliness and braveness.
      I kissed him and gave him lots of love. I have never scolded him,
      but now he never tells me anything he does.
      He climbed on the blooming green Kaḍamba tree,
      jumped into the pond and fought and killed Kālingan,
      the snake that has a thousand poisonous tongues.
      Now he has come back. How can I scold him?”

1920. Yashoda says,
      “O my lord, do great people do things that are not suitable?
      I gave birth to you. What can I do?
      You fought with Arishṭāsuran when he came as a bull
      from the fragrant forest where he lived
      bellowing like thunder and shaking all the seven worlds,
      as his eyes angry eyes looked like hot fire.
      It seems that you killed him and have come back home.”

1921. Kaliyan the chief of rich lovely Thirumangai
      surrounded with strong walls and the wide ocean
      composed fourteen sweet musical pāsurams on the lord
      who killed the angry elephant Kuvalayābeedam as large as a mountain.
      The poet describes how the cowherdess Yasodha,
      her walk as gentle as a swan’s, worries about him.
      If devotees learn and recite these pāsurams
      they will have no troubles in life.

### 98. Iduvenno, Iduvenno

1922. A cowherd girl says to Kaṇṇan,
      “You didn’t come on the day you said you would to see me,
      but wearing earrings in your ears and lovely clothes on your waist
      and a cool tulasi garland shedding its pollen on your chest
      you come here now and stand behind me.
      What is this? What is this?”

1923. A cowherd girl says to Kaṇṇan,
      “You wear an orange dress, your hair is tied up in a knot
      and you have tied a kachu around your waist.
      You come near the door in the backyard and stand there.
      What do you want? What is this? What is this?”

1924. A cowherd girl says to Kaṇṇan,
      “You, matchless, carry an eagle banner
      and you killed Sakāṭāsuran when he came as a cart,
      and now you come into our home in our village and frighten us.
      What are you doing in the night like this?
      What is this? What is this?”

1925. A cowherd girl says to Kaṇṇan,
      “You are the sweet Nāraṇan with many names adorned with thulasi garlands.
      You come like Kāma, the god of love, sing songs
      and enter our homes.
      Why are you doing this in the middle of the night?
      What is this? What is this?”

1926. A cowherd girl says to Kaṇṇan.
      “Your hair is long and curly, you carry a small sword
      and you are adorned with many golden ornaments
      studded with beautiful diamonds.
      You have come into our front yard
      and you smile and just stand there.
      Why do you do this? What is this? What is this?”

1927. A cowherd girl says to Kaṇṇan.
      “You left the cowherds and their cows,
      carrying a curved victorious bow,
      and now you look to see if anyone is around
      and enter our homes when no one is there.
      Why are you doing this where others might see?
      What is this? What is this?”

1928. A cowherd girl says to Kaṇṇan,
      “You, our beloved, fought the wrestlers with your strong arms.
      Last night we already knew what you wanted.
      You always go away without telling us when you will come back,
      and if you do tell us, you never come when you said you would.
      O god! What is this? What is this? What is this?”

1929. A cowherd says to Kaṇṇan
      “You are faultless.
      You entered a pond, caught the snake Kālingan
      and danced on his heads.
      You don’t think we’re as important to you as you used to—
      you have many good girlfriends.
      O god! What is this? What is this? What is this?”

1930. A cowherd girl says to Kaṇṇan.
      “You are a handsome young man.
      The goddess of wealth Lakshmi
      and the earth goddess stay with you,
      but you join the beautiful cowherd girls
      and dance the kuravai dance with them.
      O my friend, do you see this?
      What is this? What is this? What is this?”

1931. Kaliyan who has strong mountain-like arms
      composed a garland of pāsurams
      describing how the cowherd girls,
      quarrel during the day with lotus-eyed Kaṇṇan.
      If devotees learn and recite these pāsurams and worship the god
      they will have no sorrow in their lives.

### 99. Her mother śays

1932. Her mother says,
      “You, the heroic lord, burnt Lanka
      and you drank the milk of the devil Putana
      when she came in the middle of the night and killed her.
      Our young girls decorated with flowers dripping with honey love you,
      but you ignore their love and don’t care about them—
      you’re just like the mothers who take away a cup of milk
      from their children’s hands whenever they want
      and don’t worry about it.
      What can I say about you?”

1933. Her mother says,
      “You, the ocean-colored lord of Thirumalai,
      danced the kuthu dance in the middle of the village,
      you subdued the seven bulls to marry Nappinnai,
      and you protected the terrified cowherds and the cows
      from the storm with Govardhana mountain.
      When you made my daughter’s bangles grow loose and fall,
      you did it as if you were taking honey from the murungai tree
      that is in the front of your temple.
      Is this because you have so much strength from your heroic deeds?”

1934. Her mother says,
      “ O lovely god, you have the color of a dark cloud,
      and the mighty discus and conch you carry in your hands
      make you even more heroic.
      My dear daughter who is precious as a garland of pearls
      is adorned with beautiful ornaments.
      She is as sweet as the nectar from the large ocean.
      You think that she is like a sweet ball of jaggery in your hands.
      Is this because you are heroic and conquered Kamsan?”

1935. Her mother says,
      “You gave part of your body to Shiva
      who has round arms and wears a deer skin.
      Your strong hands killed Narakāsuran.
      You have stolen the beautiful color of my daughter
      whose hair is decorated with alli garlands.
      You stand in front of her always and don’t go away.
      What can I say? O Nambi, you seem to think she is like a stick
      in the hands of your servants. What can I say?”

1936. Her mother says,
      “Alas, you don’t think of the beauty
      of my daughter who speaks sweetly
      and whose hair is decorated with garlands that drip honey.
      You say she is not even as good as a berry fruit lying on a path.
      I don’t understand.
      Is it because you are heroic and rode on a chariot
      and destroyed the pride of the kings in Bharatha war,
      sending them on the path to the sky?”

1937. Her mother says,
      “What is this you are doing now?
      You made the white conch bangles of my daughter grow loose
      whose mouth is as red as the petals of a murukkam flower,
      and you stand in front of her and don’t leave.
      Is that because with your bow
      you destroyed the pride of the king of Lanka
      surrounded with beautiful forts and made the gods serve you?
      O father! Why should anyone need to throw an axe
      just to make an erukkam leaf fall?”

1938. Her mother says,
      “O lord, you are our father with the color of the large ocean.
      You stole the shining color of my daughter
      whose glance is as soft as a doe’s,
      and you keep standing in front of her always, not going away.
      Why should anyone need to use even a small stick
      to make an egg break for the chick to emerge?
      Do you do these things because you are heroic
      and used your axe to cut off the thousand strong arms of Bānāsuran
      who ruled the world surrounded by oceans,
      making many kings riding strong chariots with lovely wheels
      come and obey him?”

1939. Her mother says,
      “You, colored like the dark ocean,
      have not thought of the pride of my daughter
      whose eyes are beautiful
      and whose garlanded hair swarms with bees.
      Why did you do this?
      It is because you are proud that you split open
      the chest of Hiranyan, your enemy,
      and because you became angry at Vāli and killed him
      when you felt compassion for Sugreeva?
      Do you think my daughter is only like the moisture
      that comes inside your mouth in your cheek?”

1940. Her mother says,
      “Are you proud because you are water, fire, sky,
      the large world and wind?
      Or do you think that my daughter
      with a beautiful garland in her hair has no one but you?
      I have done bad karma.
      My daughter is as precious as the nectar
      that came from the milky ocean.
      Do you think she is like the garden of a Vediyan
      who gives his attention only to making his sacrificial fire
      and gives no care to anything else?”

1941. Kaliyan the chief of Thirumangai
      with a spear in his hand
      overcame his desires for the world
      and worshiped the feet of the god truly
      and the lord gave his grace to him.
      If devotees learn and recite these ten pāsurams
      that praise the lord who is adorned
      with fresh thulasi garlands with opening buds,
      their devotion and wealth will increase.

### 100. Messengers

1942. She says,
      “O red pothu bird!
      He, the husband of the goddess of wealth, Lakshmi,
      is Madhavan adorned with a thulasi garland
      and praised from ancient times.
      O red pothu, call that wonderful god.”

1943. She says,

      O baby crow, call him!”

1944. She says,
      “O beautiful cuckoo bird, sing and call him
      who has the color of a blue sapphire.
      He stopped the storm by carrying Govardhana mountain
      and he split open the mouth of the evil Asuran
      when it came as a bird.
      O lovely cuckoo bird, sing and call him.
      Call my lord to come.”

1945. She says,
      “O lizard, call him,
      the Madhavan who danced on a pot
      and measured the world at king Mahābali’s sacrifice.
      In his hair he wears flowers dripping with honey.
      O lizard, call him to come.”

1946. She says,
      “O green parrot, say,
      ‘He carries a discus with his strong handsome arms
      and he is the lord of the Venkaṭam hills in the north.’
      O green parrot, call him to come.”

1947. She says,
      “The rooster crows and the sun rises.
      O friend, what can I do?
      It is the morning
      and the lord who has the color of the ocean
      should come. The rooster crows.”

1948. She says,
      “What can I do to stop Kāma,
      who has shot five flower arrows into my heart and hurt me?
      I was already suffering because of the love I have
      for the dark cloud-colored god.
      What can I do to stop Kāma
      who makes my love for Kaṇṇan grow?”

1949. She says,
      “Will the god Māl who lies on Adisesha
      in Thirukkudanthai surrounded with groves
      dripping with honey come here
      so that my long sharp spear-like eyes
      can see him and be happy? Will he come?”

1950. She says,
      “O mother, I don’t know who he is.
      He carries a discus and a beautiful golden bow.
      I don’t know who he is.”

1951. O devotees, sing.
      Sing the Tamil garland of pāsurams
      that Kaliyan, the chief of Thirumangai
      surrounded with groves swarming with bees,
      who wears a beautiful garland and carries a spear,
      composed on the lord.
      Sing, O devotees.

### 101. The Breeze

1952. She says,
      “Our divine god protected the cows and cowherds
      from the storm by carrying Govardhana mountain.
      Heroic, he fought with the Rākshasas with his victorious bow
      and defeated them.
      Does the breeze blow on me as if it were fire
      because I think of his heroic deeds? What can I do?”

1953. She says,
      “The cold wind hurts me
      as the dark clouds pour down drops of rain.
      Am I being punished
      because I long to see the chest and the garlands
      of the dark god colored like a cloud or the ocean? What can I do?”

1954. She says,
      “With its rays the moon is angry with me
      and makes my pale body weak.
      My conch bangles become loose. What can I do?
      He has the color of the ocean that rises with white waves.
      What can I do?
      His thulasi garland with blooming flowers
      that drip honey calls to me.”

1955. She says,
      “He were taken to the clan
      of the cowherd village and raised there.
      When Putana came as a mother
      he drank milk from her breasts and killed her.
      Do the rays of the moon burn so hot
      because I think of his heroic deeds?”

1956. She says,
      “He took the form of a man-lion
      and split the chest of Hiraṇyan in two.
      Does the ocean cry in its loneliness
      because it wants to have the bright moon
      that the god makes wane to darkness?”

1957. She says,
      “He went to Lanka, bent his victorious bow
      and fought with the Rākshasas.
      On the palm tree, the andril bird
      in its nest made of lotuses coos and hurts me
      because I think of the heroic deeds of the lord.”

1958. She says,
      “Kāma comes carrying five flower arrows,
      shoots them at me without stopping
      and makes me suffer.
      Am I being punished
      because I saw the lord as dark as a kāyām flower
      when he came on Garuḍa
      and fell in love with him?”

1959. She says,
      “When the thought of the thulasi garland
      that adorns him entered my heart,
      it came along with the lovely, cool wind
      dripping with drops of rain.
      It will be very hard for my life to be saved.”

1960. She says,
      “If bees bring and spread the fragrance
      of the beautiful fresh thulasi garland
      that devotees use to decorate him,
      my eyes that are like kendai fish will close in sleep
      and the pale color of my body will change
      to the brightness it had before.”

1961. Kaliyan, the famous chief
      who carries a sword and is praised by all in Thirumangai
      composed pāsurams on our beautiful-eyed Māyan
      who went as a messenger
      for the five Pandavas in the Bharatha war.
      If devotees learn and recite these pāsurams
      they will have no trouble in life.

### 102. She says

1962. She says,
      “The lord who carried Govardhana mountain as an umbrella
      and blocked the storm, saving the cows and the cowherds,
      and who danced the Kuravai dance with young girls in the mandram
      has enchanted me.
      The andril bird on the palm tree in the front yard coos and hurts me.
      Who can remove its nest so it will not coo and call its absent mate?”

1963. She says,
      “The heroic Kaṇṇan who shattered the blooming Kurundam trees,
      and broke the tusks of the elephant Kuvalayābeeḍam
      fought with the Asuran who came as a horse,
      took the form of a man-lion and killed Hiraṇyan,
      and drank milk from the devil Putana and killed her.
      When Kaṇṇan is with me what can the music
      of the bamboo flute of a cowherd do to my youth?”

1964. She says,
      “The dark sapphire-colored lord fought the wrestlers sent by Kamsan
      and conquered Kamsan and killed him.
      I think always of his cool thulasi garlands strung with alli flowers.
      The breeze comes and torments me in the evening
      and the bells of the strong bulls returning from the fields give me pain.”

1965. She says,
      “The faultless lord shot his arrows and destroyed the seven marā trees.
      Whenever I think of his divine feet,
      the sound of the cool dark ocean that roars all night
      and the cold wind that blows make me suffer. What can I do?”

1966. She says,
      “My mother scolds me.
      The calling of the andril bird makes me sick with love.
      The waves of the ocean roar and my bangles grow loose.
      These things have happened
      only since I fell in love with the beloved of Nappinnai
      whose waist is adorned with golden clothes and who walks softly like a swan
      with hair decorated with beautiful flowers.”

1967. She says,
      “The lord who carries a discus and a conch
      came to me in a dream and made me love him.
      Except me and my friend, the whole world is sleeping.
      The rooster has not crowed yet and it is very dark.”

1968. She says,
      “It is not fair that Kāma
      who is no relative of mine causes me pain,
      yet the ocean-colored god is my beloved
      and if Kāma is his son, he is also my son.
      He shoots the fire of love at me every night
      and my young breasts swell out
      loving the precious sapphire-colored lord.”

1969. She says,
      “The beloved god of Thirumalirunjolai
      where the clouds float high
      took my chastity and my heart and went away.
      He hasn’t thought of me at all after that.
      It is dawn yet?
      Where does the hot sun go and hide?
      Wouldn’t it be better if my suffering body could sleep?”

1970. She says,
      “O friend, Kāma shoots his arrows and makes us suffer.
      We shouldn’t think that we are just women and that we are weak.
      We should carry pure water and flowers and go where he stays.
      If we worship and praise him,
      won’t we be able to see the dark cloud-colored god with our eyes?”

1971. Kaliyan, the chief of Thirumangai praised by all,
      composed ten pāsurams on the victorious lord
      who fought and killed the seven heroic bulls.
      If devotees learn and recite these pāsurams
      they will not experience the results of their karma in this world.

### 103. She says.

1972. She says,
      “He drove a shining chariot in the Bharatha war
      and he measured the world in three footsteps at Mahābali’s sacrifice.
      He fought with the Rākshasas and destroyed the pride of Lanka.
      See, my conch bangles have grown loose
      and I have lost my beauty because I love him.

1973. She says,
      “He stays in my heart.
      When the elephant Gajendra with huge legs was caught by a crocodile,
      he came and saved him and gave him his grace.
      I sing and dance, praising the names of broad-armed Neḍumal
      and my breasts do not grow slack or lose their bright color.
      What is this?”

1974. She says,
      “He saved all the four Vedas and taught them to the sages.
      He came to me, made my precious golden bangles loose,
      entered my heart and stayed there, without leaving.
      What is this? I don’t understand what he is thinking.

1975. The lord who was born as a little child and toddled
      stole fragrant ghee from the uṛi and ate it happily.
      He stays in beautiful Thirukkuḍanthai
      surrounded with fragrant groves.
      How could I say I don’t know him?

1976. If devotees bow to him and worship him every day
      he gives his grace to them
      and so we also bow and worship the lord
      and keep him in our mind as our refuge.

1977. Kaṇṇan measured the world with one foot
      and the sky with the other
      and his devotees keep his feet in their hearts.
      The gods in the sky worship him folding their lotus hands.

1978. Kaṇṇan is in my mind.
      Is it his māyam that makes the bangles on my arms grow loose?
      Is this because we are women and have the nature of women?
      We sing and praise the Thiruvenkaṭam hills of the lord and his Srirangam.

1979. O good heart, we want go join him.
      Let us dance and sing the praise of our dear lord.
      Let us think of the thousand-named god
      and let us wear his thulasi garland.

1980. O good heart!
      Let us fold our hands and worship him
      who stays happily in Thiruvāli
      where swans wander on the seashore
      so that our bad karma will go away,
      and let us wear flowers from the divine golden feet
      of the lord who has the color of a cloud.

1981. Kaliyan the poet composed ten Tamil musical pāsurams
      on the lord who has a thousand names.
      If devotees learn these names,
      they will rule all the three worlds.
      They who hear these pāsurams will live
      without any troubles in this world.

### 104.
1982. When the world was inundated by a terrible flood
      and the waves of the ocean rose
      and the water flowed everywhere
      and people had no place to go,
      the gods in the sky went to the lord and said,
      “There is no refuge for us,”
      and Thirumāl took the form of a fish,
      carried all the mountains on his back and saved all.
      Worship him, O my heart, do not forget him.

1983. As a turtle he supported Mandara mountain on his back
      and using it as a churning stick and the snake Vasuki as a rope
      he churned the milky ocean
      while all the gods in the sky helped him.
      That Thirumāl is our refuge.

1984. He is the ancient god who, at the end of the eon,
      became a boar and saved everything from the flood—
      the worlds of the gods and all the seven worlds
      where the faultless moon and the sun shine,
      and all mountains and rivers of the earth, and the seven oceans.
      Containing all the worlds and the oceans
      in the vessel that he carried on his foot,
      he protected us. He is our ruler.

1985. As a man-lion he went to Hiraṇyan
      and with heroic fiery eyes and his garland hanging down by his arms,
      he angrily split open the Rākshasa’s chest with his sharp claws.
      His heroism is greater than the large oceans
      that surround all the three worlds.

1986. He took the form of a dwarf-sage
      and went to the heroic king Mahābali’s sacrifice,
      reciting the Vedas as one who knows the truth.
      When he asked for three feet of land from the king,
      the king granted his wish, and he grew tall
      and measured the sky with one foot and the earth with the other.
      Let the feet of that king who measured the seven worlds and the sky rule us.

1987. As heroic Parasuraman, he fought with his axe
      and defeated the twice eight and four kings of the world.
      The lord who swallowed all the seven worlds and spat them out
      is the beloved the earth goddess, of Lakshmi and of Nappinnai.
      He rules us happily.

1988. As Rama in the forest, he chased the Rākshasa Marisan
      who came as a golden deer to delight Sita
      whose sharp eyes were like spears, and he killed it.
      When Sita was kidnapped by Rāvaṇa
      he went to Lanka, killed the Rākshasas, shattered Lanka into pieces,
      and, shooting his powerful arrows with his bow, defeated Rāvaṇa.
      He, our Thirumāl, is our refuge.

1989. The world grew dark at the end of the eon in ancient times.
      The divine Vedas disappeared
      and the gods were shocked and did not know
      where their worlds had gone.
      He took the form of a swan,
      removed the darkness of the world and taught the Vedas to the sages
      and removed the ignorance of the world.
      The lord always gives his grace to the gods and all others.

1990. O devotees, do not think there are other ways
      you can be helped and that you do not need him.
      Worship the lord who drank the milk from the breasts of Putana and killed her.
      When he stole butter from the cowherd women and ate it,
      round-breasted Yashoda tied him to a mortar,
      but he pulled the mortar after him and walked between two marudu trees
      and knocked them down, killing the two Rākshasas who had taken their form.
      He is our refuge and he takes away the results of our bad karma.

1991. He killed the murderous, angry-faced elephant
      and he destroyed Lanka ruled by the cruel Rākshasa king,
      shooting mighty arrows from his bow.
      Kaliyan, the king of Thirumangai
      surrounded with fields and streets with rich palaces
      composed ten pāsurams on the god.
      If devotees sing these musical poems and worship him,
      they will go to the world of the gods and rule there.

### 105. Thiruchāzhal

1992. O friend, see, he went on a path filled with stones
      and lived in the forest with his wife Vaidehi with soft doe like eyes..
      The gods from the sky bowed with their heads
      adorned with garlands and worshiped
      the golden feet of Rama when he walked in the forest. Say sāzhale.

1993. O friend, see!
      After he was born he released his father Vasudeva
      from the chains that bound his ankles
      and Nandan, the cowherd chief, took him as a baby to his village
      where he was raised as Nandan’s son.
      He is our dear lord, the father of Nānmuhan, sāzhale.

1994. O friend, see!
      He was raised as a cowherd among people
      who did not know he was the lord.
      He ate happily all the fragrant butter
      that the long-haired cowherd women of the village churned and kept.
      His golden stomach that swallowed all the seven worlds
      surrounded by the deep ocean
      had still more room to eat the butter from the uri. Sāzhale.

1995. O friend, see!
      He was raised as a cowherd among the innocent cowherds of the village
      and ate and relished the fragrant butter that was kept in the uri,
      but his stomach was still not full and he swallowed all the worlds
      surrounded by the oceans with rolling waves. Sāzhale.

1996. O friend, see! The beautiful dark-haired cowherd women
      hit him with a churning stick and tied him up with a small rope,
      but though he was tied up,
      even the gods of the sky could not know who he is. Sāzhale.

1997. O friend, see!
      He danced the marakkāl kuuthu in the mandram as the drums beat
      and his devotees saw his enthusiastic dance.
      Yet though he danced the marakkāl kuuthu in the mandram,
      he is hard for the gods to know. Sāzhale.

1998. O friend, see!
      When the Kauravas disgraced Draupadi, the Pandavas’ wife,
      he went as a messenger to the Kauravas
      and asked them to give land to the Pandavas,
      but Duriyodhana disgraced him in the assembly.
      Yet even though he was disgraced in that way,
      he swallowed all the worlds surrounded by the sounding ocean
      and spat them out. Sāzhale.

1999. O friends, see.
      He drove the chariot of the Pandavas in the terrible Bharatha war
      and destroyed their enemies, the Kauravas.
      Yet even though he drove the chariot for the Pandavas
      all kings, adorned with garlands, worship him bowing their heads. Sāzhale.

2000. O friend, see!
      He went to the sacrifice of Mahābali,
      the king adorned with cool garlands,
      and begged for three feet of land,
      making those who saw him feel pity.
      Yet even though he begged for those three feet of land,
      he is the highest lord of the seven worlds. Sāzhale!

2001. O friend, see!
      He went as a dwarf to king Mahabali’s sacrifice,
      asked for three feet of land, tricked the king, grew tall
      and measured the world and the sky with his two feet.
      Even though he is the god of Thiruveḷḷam and Thiruvenkaṭam,
      he is in the heart of the poet Kaliyan. Sāzhale.
------------

### 106. The end of the eon

2002. At the end of the eon,
      he swallowed all the gods’ worlds
      and the people of the seven worlds
      surrounded with dark oceans
      and he kept them in his divine stomach for a long time.
      Think about it, O devotees.
      You worship the gods of other religions who are our enemies.
      What good did they do for us? Don’t be ungrateful.
      Worship only our lord in the sky
      who carries a discus smeared with oil.

2003. When the abundant flood came at the end of the eon
      and rose to the sky, the lord with his strong hands
      took all oceans with their water and swallowed them all.
      Everyone knows this.
      Is there anyone in the world or among the gods
      who was not swallowed and spit out by our god?
      O devotees, don’t you know that the world
      is here through his grace?

2004. He swallowed and kept in his stomach
      Shiva with an eye in his forehead, Nānmuhan, the god of the Vedas,
      Indra who rides the white elephant Airāvadam
      and all the other gods and he protected them there
      so that the victorious king of the ocean would not swallow them all.
      It is terrible that mean devotees
      do not praise the good nature of the lord with a victorious discus.

2005. At the end of the eon, the waves of the ocean
      spread everywhere in the world
      and the whole earth became a large ocean.
      He thought that all the seven worlds
      would be destroyed and he swallowed them all
      and kept them in his divine stomach, making it very large.
      He protected you all.
      He has a dark form like a ripe kaḷavam fruit.
      O devotees, why don’t you learn to worship only our unique god’s feet?

2006. At the end of the eon, the whole world was filled with water
      and no one was going to survive.
      He swallowed everyone and kept them in his divine stomach for a long time.
      O devotees, you do not understand that.
      If you understood his power,
      you would praise the thousand names of the generous king of the gods.

2007. At the end of the eon when the large flood
      rose to the sky, he swallowed all the worlds
      and the oceans and protected all.
      O devotees, you praise other new gods.
      Is there anyone who would bathe a wooden board in hot water
      and not bathe their mother who gave birth to them?
      You have no goodness in you.
      If you knew him, you would praise the thousand names
      of our generous lord.

2008. He is our dear lord of Thirukaṇṇamangai
      who protected all, swallowing all the people of the worlds,
      the gods in the sky, the Danavas and all others
      so that the huge flood that came at the end of the eon did not swallow them.
      Any time his devotees do not think of those
      who fail to worship his ankleted feet is sweet for them.

2009. At the end of the eon, the worlds were covered
      with thick darkness and the oceans rose
      in a flood that spread over all the worlds.
      Our god swallowed all the seven golden worlds,
      kept them in his stomach and protected all.
      Any devotees who do not think of the dark shining lord
      are contemptible.

2010. At the end of the eon
      when the waves of the ocean rose and touched the sky,
      he felt pity for his devotees, the gods and the sages,
      gave them his grace and swallowed all the seven worlds
      and kept them in his divine stomach.
      O devotees, sing, dance and praise
      the dark jewel-colored god of cool Kuḍandai who protected you in his stomach.

2011. Kaliyan of Thirumangai surrounded by flourishing groves
      composed a garland of musical pāsurams
      describing how the lord swallowed all the oceans,
      the directions, the Asuras, the gods in the sky and all the worlds
      and how he left no one and nothing without his protection.
      If devotees learn these pāsurams well and recite them,
      they will go to the golden world of the gods,
      receive the grace of Lakshmi on the lotus, and shine.
------------

### 107. Thenāli

2012. The dear lord whose chest is adorned with jewels
      shines like a golden hill and rides on the bird Garuḍa.
      He used Mandara mountain as a churning stick and the snake Vasuki as a rope,
      churned the milky ocean, took the nectar from it and gave it to the gods.
      If devotees have not seen him, their eyes are not truly eyes.

2013. The highest lord who is sweet to his devotees
      shines as a precious jewel that never loses its luster.
      He, the highest and incomparable one,
      went as a dwarf to Mahābali, begged for three feet of land
      and measured the world and the sky with his feet.
      If the ears of devotees have not heard of him they are not truly ears.

2014. The faultless god of Thennāli who is the divine Vedas
      drank the milk of Putana and killed her.
      If devotees have not worshiped and praised Māl’s greatness,
      whatever they say is not truly speech.

2015. The god of the gods with a chest adorned
      with a fragrant fresh thulasi garland
      took the form of a man-lion
      and split open the chest of Hiraṇyan with his sharp claws.
      If devotees do not sing his praise,
      the songs that they sing are not real songs.

2016. The lord who stays in the Thirumeyyam hills.
      and carries a conch in his hand
      has the color of the dark ocean,
      of a shining sapphire-like hill, of a dark cloud,
      of a kuvalai flower blooming on a branch and of a kāyām flower.
      If the hands of devotees have not worshiped him,
      they are not truly hands.

2017. When devotees see thulasi dripping with honey,
      fresh alari flowers, kuvilai flowers,
      thorny muḷari blossoms and ambal flowers,
      if they do not think in their hearts of the golden feet of him
      who took the forms of a swan to bring the Vedas to the earth
      and who became a boar that split open the earth
      to bring the earth goddess from the underworld,
      then their hearts are not truly hearts.

2018. If devotees do not bring flowers
      and worship with love and devotion
      the lord who has the color of the sounding ocean,
      of karuvilai flowers and of kāyām flowers
      and if they do not think of him,
      their hearts are not truly hearts.

2019. When he was a little child
      he stole and happily ate the fragrant butter
      that was kept in the uri by the cowherdesses with dark fragrant hair.
      If devotees do not think of the tall god
      whose eyes are beautiful and know him, they will never know him.

2020. The god of Thirumalirunjolai
      where bees drink honey and sing
      fought with seven bulls to marry Nappinnai
      whose eyes are as large and beautiful as flowers.
      If devotees do not become his slaves
      they are not real people. I am sure of that in my mind.

2021. Kaliyan who carries a spear in his hands
      composed ten musical pāsurams
      worshiping the feet of the lord who carries a discus.
      If devotees sing these pāsurams and dance
      all the results of their bad karma will go away.

### 108. Bhakthi. Born again

2022. O Nambi, you are smell, taste, touch and sound.
      When I complain that you have not given me your grace,
      you may say that I did not do the right things.
      I will say one thing to you.
      Do not make me to go into a womb and be born again.
      I am afraid that I will be like a tree
      on the bank of a river that may fall at any time.

2023. Even though I am angry at you
      who carry a victorious discus, I would tell you this.
      I do not want you to put me in a womb and make me be born again.
      I tremble like the minds of people on a boat caught in a terrible storm.

2024. O my lotus-eyed Kaṇṇan,
      I have suffered, born in many births
      and I am worried and afraid
      that you will make me be born again.
      My mind struggles as if I were staying
      under the same roof as a snake.

2025. I am afraid that you, the lord of the eon,
      will make me be born in many more births and suffer.
      My mind is in pain like an ant
      caught on a torch burning at both ends.

2026. I have suffered, born in many births
      and I am afraid you, the ancient god of the eon,
      will make me fall into the hole of birth again.
      My mind shivers like a crowd of foxes caught in a flood.

2027. You are the Maṇāḷan of Vayalāli
      where beautiful neelam flowers bloom
      near the water filled with lovely blossoming lotuses.
      I should not suffer like a tree
      cut down by a shepherd and thrown away.
      Give me your grace so I may reach you.

2028. Like the worm that lives in a margosa tree
      and will not eat anything except its leaves,
      I do not want to be anywhere except beneath your beautiful feet.
      You, a shining light,
      removed the curse of the waning crescent moon
      and you rest on the five-headed Adeshesa.

2029. I want nothing but your grace.
      You are the god of Srirangam
      surrounded with beautiful groves,
      a jewel and a shining diamond.
      O Madhusudhana, you who are the highest light,
      show me the path that leads to moksha.

2030. O my father, show me a path
      so I will not be plunged into indestructible hell.
      Give us, your devotees, your sweet grace always.
      You are the Chandogya Upanishad, our chief with lotus eyes.
      O dear one, give your grace to me, your slave.

2031. Kaliyan, king of famous Thirumangai,
      composed ten pāsurams praising the cowherd,
      the god who protected the cows from the storm
      by carrying Govardhana mountain as an umbrella.
      If devotees learn and recite these ten pāsurams
      they will never experience the results of their karma. (1083)

## 11. Thirukkurundānḍagam -- Thirumangaiyāzhvār (2032 -2051)
2032. I bow and praise him, the wise Thirumāl,
      a treasure, a coral pillar, my fate.
      He killed Kamsan to protect the world.
      If the devotees think of him as a true path,
      he will give them moksha,
      and I am his devotee and he has entered my heart.
      I will not leave him.

2033. The lord is the earth, wind, water, fire, the sky,
      a beautiful shining jewel,
      nectar, a river of joy for his devotees,
      Yama for the Asuras and he stays in the Himalayas.
      He is as strong as a bull
      and he destroyed Lanka surrounded with protected walls.
      O heart, think of the divine nature of the lord
      and praise him, praise him.

2034. Our father, the highest, churned the wide milky ocean
      using large Mandara mountain as a churning stick
      and the snake Vasuki as a rope,
      took nectar from it and gave it to the gods.
      I worship the young god of Thirumālirunjolai
      filled with thick bamboo groves
      where the rays of the sun cannot go.

2035. I long to see in my dreams
      the sweet lord with the color of a dark Kāyām flower.
      He took the form of a boar
      and brought the earth goddess from beneath the earth.
      I worship him with words and praise him with devotion,
      thinking of him with love in my mind and caring.

2036. He is like hot iron
      and my love for him is like water poured on it
      as he takes my love inside him.
      His love is like sugarcane juice for me .
      I have become a slave for the sweet one and I am saved.

2037. He, the god of Kuḍandai shining like a pile of diamonds,
      is the first one among all the three gods,
      the king of the whole world,
      sweet poetry, fresh honey and pure gold
      and the flowers that adorn the hair of the gods in the sky.
      What can his devotees say to praise him?

2038. The lord of Srirangam,
      surrounded by flourishing water
      is this birth, future births, moksha and truth for his devotees.
      Bowing my head, I worship the devotees
      of the dark faultless lord who think of the wonderful nature
      of the unique god of Thiruvenkaṭam.

2039. Thirumal, colored like a cloud in the sky,
      is the honey that bees make in the hills,
      sugarcane juice and a treasure.
      If devotees do not embrace him and live
      they do not realize that their human birth is a waste.
      If the devotees think of him always
      they will find happiness in their lives.

2040. My heart, confused and unable to stay on one thought,
      suffers like an ant on a torch burning at both end.
      You are wise, the god of the gods in the sky,
      the light that swallowed the whole world.
      I have no help but you for all my seven births.

2041. You are my father, a pearl, a shining emerald,
      with the color of a cloud
      shining with lightning and roaring with thunder.
      My mind is not steady—what can I do?
      I have done bad karma.
      Give me your grace and tell me what should I do
      to love you with devotion.
      You are my lord and I know nothing except being a slave for you
      and loving you with devotion.

2042. O father, give me your grace so that I may serve you,
      praise you and worship your feet.
      You are the world, the ancient god of all eight directions,
      justice and the highest light. Take away all my worries.
      I will praise only you.

2043. You, the life of all, stay in Srirangam.
      When I, your impure devotee, was afraid
      because I have done bad karma
      and I worried how I am going to escape its results,
      you, the kāvi-flower-colored lord came,
      entered my heart and said, “Do not be afraid.”

2044. My eyes rejoiced seeing the god,
      sweet as sugarcane, of Srirangam
      surrounded with groves where bees swarm.
      Just as water sprinkled on iron dries up,
      my sorrows and karma have gone away.

2045. I, a sinner, always thought of embracing women
      whose beautiful eyes vanquish Kāvi flowers,
      plunged into my desires and was destroyed
      without thinking of you,
      god of Kuḍanthai surrounded with water
      where swans that have beautiful feathers live.

2046. Hanuman, your messenger, went to Lanka,
      burned Rāvaṇa’s Lanka surrounded with strong walls,
      came back and bowed devotedly to Rama's feet.
      Even though I cannot do what he did, I am your devotee.
      With my bones melting, I take the water of knowledge
      with the love that is my heart and bathe you in it.

2047. Our lord killed the Rakshasa Mārisan
      when he came as a magical deer,
      walked between the marudam trees
      and destroyed the two Asurans,
      measured the world and the sky with his feet at Mahābali's sacrifice,
      and churned the milky ocean, took the nectar from it
      and gave it to the gods in the sky.
      I, his devotee, adorn my dear lord
      with a pure beautiful garland made of my praise.

2048. If devotees praise the compassion of the generous lord
      they will not be born again.
      The world says that even those devotees
      who, like Sisupālan, scolded him were saved by him
      and reached moksha.
      Though I am ignorant and have many desires,
      I praise him and do not scold him
      because I do not want to be born again.
      I have abundant love for him and wish to join the lord
      whose color is like the wave-filled ocean.
      .
2049. If someone removes the weakness
      that comes from ignorance and egoism
      and closes his eyes and controls the desires of the five senses,
      loving only him and not letting his thoughts wander,
      he will see the shining light that is truly the lord.

2050. When the skull of the Nānmuhan on the lotus
      was stuck to Shiva's hand
      and he wandered among houses begging for food,
      our lord removed the curse of Shiva and made it fall off.
      If devotees go to Thirukkaṇḍiyur, Srirangam,
      Thirumeyyam, Thirukkachi, Thirupperur
      and Thirukkaḍalmallai,
      and worship him, they will be saved.
      How can others be saved if they do not worship him?

2051. Kaliyan with a strong spear
      composed a beautiful garland of twenty Tamil pasurams
      on our lovely-eyed lord.
      Indra, the king of gods and Nānmuhan who stays on a lotus
      worship his feet every day,
      sprinkling flowers that drip with honey.
      If devotees learn and recite these twenty pasurams faultlessly
      they will go to the bright sky and rule there.

## 12. Thiruneḍunthāṇḍagam - Thirumangaiyāzhvār (2052 – 2081)

This book is divided into three parts.

1. Praise of the god .
2. A mother speak about her daughter who loves Kaṇṇan.
3. The daughter who loves Kaṇṇan talks about her love with her friend.

### Praising god

2052. Shining like lightning, he is the four Vedas,
      the light of a lamp, the rising crescent moon,
      the past and the future.
      Without sickness, old age, birth or death,
      he is gold and diamond
      and shines as the five elements–earth, water, fire, wind and sky.
      He, my father, enters me with his true form
      and I keep his divine shoot-like feet on my head.

2053. He is fire, water, wind, sky and earth,
      all religions and all the three gods,.
      Shiva is colored red like fire, Nānmuhan is colored like gold
      and Thirumāl is colored like the ocean—
      our lord shines with all their three forms together.

2054. Neḍumal with his divine body who is far away
      shone with the white color of a conch in the Treta yuga.
      When he took the nectar from the milky ocean,
      our divine Thirumāl had a dark blue color.
      We cannot say that he has only one form,
      we can only praise him saying
      that he has different forms in each eon.
      Who has seen the dark beautiful-eyed god?
      Who can describe him?

2055. Our lord who is more ancient than Indra and Nānmuhan.
      is the five elements–the large earth, wind, fire water and sky,
      the beautiful sound of Tamil,
      the words of the northern language,
      the four directions, the sun and moon.
      Even the gods in the sky do not know him and his divine nature.
      He is the secret of the mantras of the Vedas
      that the Vediyars recite in the evening.
      O ignorant heart, do not forget those mantras.
      If you recite them always and live, you will be saved.

2056. When he came as a dwarf to king Mahābali’s sacrifice,
      he measured the earth and the ocean with one foot
      and he raised his other foot to the wide sky
      spreading over all the eight directions
      and crossed the cool moon, the sun and the stars
      and went still above,
      going beyond all the thoughts in the Asuran Mahābali’s mind.
      I worship the flower-like divine feet of my father
      that measured the whole earth and the sky.

2057. He, the god of the gods, is generous
      and he gives to his devotees
      as much as they want with his ample hands.
      He rides on the beautiful-winged Garuḍa,
      conquers the Asuras, not giving them his grace.
      O heart, let us go and praise his feet in beautiful Thirukkovalur
      where the Peṇṇai river flows flourishing
      through many lands filling ponds with its water
      and bringing with its waves
      tall bamboo plants that throw out pearls
      and leaving gold on its banks.

2058. He came as Parasurāman, fought with kings
      whose arms are wide and strong as mountains,
      conquered them and ruled the world,
      and he conquered Murugan
      who threw his spear at the ocean to fight with Asurans.
      He stays in Thirukkovalur
      where famous king Malaiyarasan worshiped him,
      surrounded by fragrant groves
      and filled with long streets and lotus ponds,
      guarded by the lovely chaste goddess of the Vindya mountains.
      O heart, come, let us go and worship him there.

2059. You are in the hearts of your devotees
      and in Thiruneeragam, on the top of Thiruneermalai,
      Nilāthingalthuṇḍam in Thiruppadi,
      Thiruvuragam in flourishing Kachi,
      and Thiruvekka surrounded with flourishing water.
      The whole world worships you, the god of Thirukkāragam.
      O thief, you stay in the sky and in Thirupperur
      where on the southern bank of the Kāviri
      beautiful flowers bloom in the groves.
      You, the highest one, stay in my heart and you will not leave me.
      I worship only your divine feet.

2060. You stay in Thirumallai on the ocean
      where ships bring precious diamonds
      and in Kachi surrounded with forts and in Thirupperur.
      As part of your body, you have Shiva,
      adorned with a beautiful kondrai garland dripping with honey
      who shares his body with Shakthi, the daughter of the king of the Himalayas.
      You, the highest in the world, beautiful as coral,
      rest on Adisesha on the milky ocean
      and stay on the peak of the Himalayas, the snow mountains.
      I, a poor man, wander everywhere looking for you.

2061. You, the famous one, guarded the seven worlds
      and I am your poor devotee.
      What can I do except prattle on, saying,
      “What are you? Who are you?”
      You are the god of the southern, northern, eastern and western lands
      praised by the whole world,
      the first among the gods, a bright light worshiped by all.
      You are the past and the future.
      You, the origin of all, stay in Thirumuzhikkaḍalmallai.

A worrying mother!

2062. Her mother says,
      “My daughter wears silk garments.
      She feels tired and sad
      and doesn’t want to play with her doll.
      Her eyes are filled with tears and she can’t sleep.
      She doesn’t want to sit on my lap at all.
      She asks, ‘Where is my lord’s Srirangam?’
      I asked the fortune teller about her
      ‘O fortune teller,
      my daughter whose fragrant hair swarms with bees
      that have drunk honey from flowers is as soft as a doe.
      Who makes her worry like this? Tell me the truth.’
      She said, ‘It is the ocean-colored god.’
      He is our protector
      and if he has done this who can save us?”

2063. “My daughter’s heart melts with love for him
      and her eyes are filled with tears.
      She stands searching until she is tired.
      She sighs and doesn’t want to eat or sleep.
      She says, ‘O Nambi, who rest on the snake bed,
      you are lord of Thiruvayalāli
      surrounded with beautiful creepers blooming with flowers.
      O friend! Shall we go there dance and sing
      where the Garuḍa flag flies?
      Can we go and play in the water in beautiful Srirangam?’
      I gave birth to this girl but she doesn’t listen to me.
      A pity! The world is blaming me for what she does.”

2064. “My daughter says,
      ‘You carried Govardhana mountain
      and protected the cows and the cowherds from the storm
      and you stay in Thiruvarangam in beautiful Kachi.
      You, the king resting on Adisesha in Thiruvekka
      broke the bow and married Sita and embraced her soft arms,
      and you fought with the wrestlers and killed them.
      You are young and strong and you killed the Asuran Kesi
      when he came as a horse.’
      She teaches her parrot to say his names,
      shedding tears and they drip on her breasts
      and she is tired.”

2065. “My daughter says,
      ‘He is a sprouting shoot with the dark color of a cloud
      and he stays in Thirukkuṛunguḍi.
      He is the first one, without any end,
      who came as a dwarf, grew tall
      and crossed over all the three worlds at Mahābali’s sacrifice.
      Faultless, limitless nectar, he stays in Srirangam.
      and in the minds of the Vediyars.
      Like the brightness of a lamp and precious like an emerald,
      he stays in Thiruthangā and Thiruvekkaa.’
      When my daughter sings the praise of Thirumāl
      her parrot listens and sings with her.
      She is happy that she taught her beautiful parrot the praise of the lord
      and she says ‘I taught you the praise of the lord and I am happy to hear that from you. ’ ------------ She folds her hands and worships him.”

2066. “My daughter says,
      ‘He, mighty as an elephant,
      stays in Kachi surrounded by strong stone walls.
      He is a sweet fruit and he rests on Adisesha on the ocean.
      Our father happily stays in beautiful Thiruvazhundur
      surrounded with fields, ponds and blooming alli flowers.’
      My innocent daughter carries a veena
      that touches her breasts, smiles beautifully
      and plucks it with her fingers, making them red
      as she sings like a prattling parrot.”

2067. “My daughter says,
      ‘You, mighty as a bull, happily grazed the cows.
      You are my sweet fruit and you stay in Thirukkaṇṇapuram
      surrounded with fragrant groves.
      You are the god of Thiruvenkaṭam in the north
      and you danced happily in the mandram.
      You stay in Thirunaṛaiyur surrounded with abundant groves.
      O king, you conquered the Asurans and destroyed their tribes,
      and you, with a dark color and thick curly hair, are my help.’
      The tears she sheds fall on her breasts and she is tired.”

2068. “My daughter’s round soft breasts
      have changed their color to gold and are pale.
      Her fish eyes are filled with tears.
      She melts when she hears the voice of the lovely red-legged dove
      calling softly for its mate.
      Praising Thiruthangaa, flourishing Thirukkuḍanthai
      and Thirukkovalur where he stays, she sings and dances.
      When I asked my daughter,
      ‘Dear girl, do you think what you’re doing is good for our family?’
      she only praises Thirunaraiyur and sings.”

2069. “My daughter says,
      ‘Colored like a dark cloud,
      he has hands and feet that are like beautiful lotuses.
      He loves the beautiful earth goddess
      and he is crazy about doll-like Lakshmi.’
      What have I done?
      My lovely innocent daughter doesn’t listen to me,
      but asks me, ‘Where is Srirangam of my divine lord?
      I will go to Thiruneermalai where the ocean-colored lord stays.’
      Is this the way women talk who have lost their chastity?”

2070. “My daughter’s breasts have not grown out yet.
      Even though she knows that beautiful Lakshmi stays on his chest
      she lost her chastity for him.
      She sighs and says to her friend,
      ‘O friend, shall we go to Srirangam and play in the water?’
      I gave birth to her but she doesn’t listen to me.
      She just sings and praises the names
      of the god of Thirupperur and Thirukkuḍandai
      and goes to bathe in the ponds
      where golden lotuses bloom.
      There is no one precious like her for me.
      Does your daughter, precious as gold,
      do the same things as mine?”

2071. Her mother says,
      “He, the generous lord, burned the southern Lanka
      and destroyed the wealth of the Rakshasa Rāvaṇa
      who carried a shining sword and drove his chariot heroically.
      He cut off the thousand arms of Vāṇāsuran,
      and as a dwarf, he measured the world with one foot
      and crossed the earth with the other.
      He, ruler of the world, swallowed the earth, spat it out
      and kept it again in his stomach and protects it.
      My daughter praises his divine names always
      and we can only say that she must have done marvellous tapas
      to praise his names always on this earth.
-------------

The daughter’s worry

2072. The daughter says to her friend ,
      “O friend, the dark-colored lord with fragrant hair
      hunts with a strong bow.
      He wore shining emerald earrings swinging from both his ears.
      He came together with Lakshmi and stood in front of me
      and I was fascinated with his beautiful lotus hands,
      mouth, eyes and feet.
      O friend, I was afraid he might be divine.”

2073. The daughter says,
      “He came, sang the raga naivaḷam,
      and looked at me, standing there as if he was shy.
      As soon as I heard his song,
      my mind and eyes went to the dear lord
      and I bowed to his divine feet.
      The bracelets on my hands and the mekalai on my waist
      became loose and fell and I couldn’t see them.
      I saw only his golden emerald earrings and his four arms.
      I asked him, ‘How far is the temple of our dear lord?’
      and he answered, ‘This indeed is the beautiful Thiruvāli, his temple.’”

2074. The daughter says,
      “He gave me his love and made my heart suffer.
      He made my golden color turn pale
      and my shining bangles become loose.
      He told me, ‘My place is Srirangam
      where fish drink the sweet water
      dripping from the young coconut trees’ and left.
      I saw him adorned with fresh thulasi garland
      that drips honey in my dream
      and told him, ‘O lord, you ride on Garuḍa, don’t go away.
      Whatever is happening, it seems that are quarreling.” X

2075. Her daughter says,
      “What a pity!
      The conch bangles on my hands have grown loose.
      The ocean-colored lord
      with a conch in one hand and in the other a discus
      and who swallowed the whole world
      came here, loved me, told me that he stays in Srirangam
      and went, leaving me with the sorrow of love
      and filling my eyes that are like fighting fish with tears.”

2076. Her daughter says,
      “The heroic lord who killed the elephant Kuvalayābeedam
      with his mighty arms and shines like lightning
      has a beautiful mouth and eyes
      and wears a fresh fragrant thulasi garland and emerald earrings.
      He took away my health, chastity, and thoughts,
      making my bangles loose and I became his slave.
      As he went through the fragrant cherundi grove
      blooming with golden flowers,
      he said his place is Srirangam surrounded with water and left.”

2077. Her daughter says,
      “O small bee with six legs and dots on your wings,
      you and your mate stay happily on flowers and drink honey.
      I bow to you. Go to the god of the gods
      who loves the cows and grazes them
      and stays in beautiful Thiruvazhundur.
      Stay there and see him. Don’t be afraid.
      Tell him , ‘I am a girl and love him.’
      and see what he says.”

2078. The daughter says,
      “O beautiful red-legged crane,
      if you go today to Thirukkaṇṇapuram
      and tell my beloved lovely-eyed Thirumāl of my love,
      nothing could make me more happy.
      I will give you all this flourishing land
      and fish from the ponds to eat.
      You and your beloved mate can come here,
      stay happily and enjoy your life.”

2079. The daughter says,
      “O friend, he who destroyed the forts of southern Lanka
      and killed the Rakshasas,
      measured the earth and the sky
      and drove the chariot for Arjuna in the Bharatha war
      is large as a mountain and strong as an elephant.
      I will embrace him with my gold-ornamented breasts.
      I won’t let him go. I will plunge into the love for him
      thinking always of him,
      melting with joy that fills my body.”

2080. The daughter says,
      “My lord, the beloved of Nappinnai the cowherd girl,
      churned the milky ocean with waves,
      shot his arrows and killed the king of the Rakshasas
      whose strength never failed, conquering and destroying the Raksasas,
      and carried Govardhana mountain in his arms, protecting the cows.
      I am his slave and I worship Neḍumāl,
      the tall god of cool Thirukuḍanthai and Thiruvinnagaram
      surrounded by the ocean rolling with waves.

2081. When the gods and the sages praised
      and worshiped you saying,
      “You are the god of the gods in the sky. Give us your grace,”
      you, our father with the color of a dark cloud shining with lightning,
      took the form of a swan, brought up the divine Vedas
      from the bottom of the ocean and taught them to the sages.
      Kaliyan, with a sharp spear, Yama for his enemies
      and the chief of Thirumangai filled with palaces
      studded with precious shining jewels,
      composed a wonderful garland of ten Tamil pasurams.
      If devotees learn and recite these pasurams
      they will not have the results of their karma.
---------------

## 13. Mudal Thiruvandādi.- Poyhai Azhvar (2082 – 2181)

2082. The world is a lamp for me,
      wide ocean is its ghee,
      and the warm sun is its light.
      I place this garland of words on the feet
      of the lord with a shining discus
      and ask him to take me from the ocean of sorrow.

2083. I do not know when you churned the milky ocean
      or when the whole earth was surrounded with the seas,
      all I know is that the world is created by you
      and you swallowed and spat it out at the end of the eon.

2084. With one foot you measured the whole world
      and with the other rose to the sky and measured it.
      O wonderful lord!
      I cannot understand how you are able to measure the world
      and sky like that.

2085. Our god opens the door of moksha for those
      who control their five senses
      and he himself is the path of moksha.
      Shiva who taught dharma to the four sages
      staying under the shadow of a banyan tree
      and drank poison when the milky ocean was churned
      understands the power of Thirumāl
      and is a part of our lord’s body,

2086. The names of Thirumāl and Shiva are Nāraṇan and Haran
      and Garuḍa and a bull are their vehicles.
      They taught the Vedas and the Agamas to the sages,
      Kailasa and the milky ocean are their temples
      and their actions are protecting and destroying the world.
      One carries a discus and the other spear in his hand,
      and one has a dark shining body like a cloud
      and the other a body like fire.

2087. He has the color of the ocean rolling with waves
      and I have never forgotten him.
      O, innocent ones, how could I forget him today.
      Even when I was in the womb,
      I worshiped the lord folding my hands, and I saw the god
      as I gazed in the direction of Srirangam where he stays.

2088. Our lord is in all the directions with all the gods
      and is in all the actions that they do and in their results.
      All these things are the illusions of Neḍumāl
      who is the everlasting cloud-colored Kaṇṇan,

2089. O Thirumāl, why did you put the conch in your mouth
      and blow it and mesmerize all when you fought in the
      Bharatha battle holding your heroic weapon, the discus in your hand?
      Why did you hide the sun with the wheel of a chariot?

2090. You took the form boar and on your single tusk
      you brought up the earth goddess from the underworld.
      Was that not the same earth that you measured
      with your divine feet
      as the sky and all the directions trembled?

2091. O lord with a heroic discus!
      People say that you really swallowed the earth, hills,
      the oceans rolling with waves, the wind and the sky.
      If one tries to understand how you did that,
      was your mouth as big as the whole earth at that time?

2092. He measured the world with his feet
      and my mouth will not praise any other but him.
      My hands will not worship anyone but him
      who drank the poisonous milk
      from the breasts of the devil Putanā.
      My eyes will not see anyone except him
      and my ears will not hear any other name except his.

2093. The nature of the lord who took the form of a boar to bring
      the earth goddess from the underworld is
      the feelings of all the five sense organs—
      ears, mouth, eyes, nose and body—
      and hot fire, earth, wind, water and the sky,
      undiminished wisdom, knowledge and good dharma.

2094. They who were born as people in ancient times,
      recited the sastras and the Vedas in the proper way
      and worshiped him with the correct rules
      became the excellent gods and reached
      the feet of the lord adorned with a thulasi garland.

2095. People praise various gods in the ways they know,
      saying, “This or that god is our dear lord,”
      and they put their pictures on the wall and worship them,
      but any god that they pray to is only our lord.

2096. The three gods came first,
      and among them the ocean-colored god was first.
      If we do not have his grace,
      the grace given by any of the others is just a waste.

2097. When I realized that I have spent all my days in vain,
      I was afraid and cried,
      and I worshiped the feet of the ocean colored lord with lovely eyes
      resting on Adisesha, the snake bed
      as the water of the strong waves touches his feet.

2098. People praise his heroism and say,
      “When the lord who split open the chest of the Hiraṇyan with his sharp claws
      measured the world, riding on Garuḍa,
      one foot was on the earth and his head touched the sky
      while his arms were extended in all the directions.”

2099. The lord drank the poisonous milk from the breasts of Putanā,
      fought and conquered the elephant Kuvalayaabeedam,
      split open the mouth of the Asuran that came in the form of a bird,
      entered between the Marudu trees and killed the Raksasas,
      and ate the butter from the uri happily.
      He measured the world and the sky at the sacrifice of Mahābali,

2100. O dark ocean,
      Thirumāl has a dark body and beautiful eyes.
      He swallowed the earth
      and slept on a banyan leaf as a baby at the end of the eon
      rests on you, carrying a discus.
      What penance you have done
      to touch always the divine dark body of the lord?

2101. The gods sprinkle fresh flowers, fold their hands
      and worship the beautiful divine lotus feet of the lord
      who cut the chains on the ankles of his father and released him
      and took the form of a dwarf
      and swallowed the earth and the sky.

2102. Lovely-eyed Thirumāl with a discus
      who rides on the bird Garuda
      rests on the snake Adishesa.
      He took water from Mahābali’s hand,
      asked for three feet of land,
      measured the earth with one foot
      and raised his other foot to measure the sky.
      O heart, you know that we should go to him, our refuge.

2103. O lord, you ride on Garuda with dotted wings!
      Yashoda with arms soft and round like bamboo
      tied you with a rope when you stole butter and ate it.
      It is not only I, but the whole world that knows this—
      I have seen the rope marks on your body.

2104. The lord with the color of the ocean rolling with waves
      has scars on his fingers from using his Sharngam bow,
      a mark on his shoulders where Lakshmi leaned on him
      and a scar on his feet from when he kicked Sakaṭāsuran,
      the Asuran in the form of a cart.
      His fingers are swollen
      because he split open with his claws the chest of Hiraṇyan
      as Lakshmi, her hair adorned with flowers, saw him in fear.

2105. O lord with the color of the ocean rolling with waves,
      when Yasodha the cowherdess saw butter on your mouth and fingers
      and tied you to the mortar, you did not cry loudly
      and the neighbors did not hear you.
      Why you did that? Tell me.

2106. My heart praises without ceasing the emerald-colored lord
      who stays in the hills and rests on the ocean.
      He split open the chest of Hiraṇyan
      and, taking the form of a boar, split open the earth
      and went to the underworld to bring up the earth goddess.

2107. If devotees get up in the morning,
      go to Thiruvenkaṭam hills that brighten the mind
      and if every day they worship the lord who wears a thulasi garland,
      the results of their karma will be removed.

2108. The hands of the lord that carry a strong bow
      carried Govardhana hills to save the cows and the cowherds.
      He split open the mouth of the Asuran when he came as a bird,
      broke seven maraa trees with his bow,
      broke the tusks of the heroic elephant Kuvalayābeeḍam,
      and made the blooming kurundam trees fall.

2109. O god with the dark color of a cloud,
      you carry in your hands the valampuri conch and a discus,
      embrace Lakshmi, the goddess of wealth on your chest,
      have Brahma, the creator of the wonderful Vedas on your navel,
      and have Shiva, the destroyer of the three forts in your body.

2110. He is the earth, the wide sky, the wind,
      the roaring ocean and hot fire.
      Know that the lord with lovely eyes
      removed the suffering of Gajendra
      with beautiful eyes and tusks like crescent moon
      when he was caught by a crocodile.
      You know that he will appear when his devotees are in trouble
      and help them.

2111. If devotees keep their hearts pure,
      follow the good path
      and understand clearly what wisdom is,
      their hearts will go to the feet of the lord
      adorned with thulasi garland,
      like a calf that goes to his mother
      understanding that she is his mother.

2112. Even for the time that to blink an eye
      I will not think of anything except the feet of Thirumāl
      who carries a valampuri conch in one hand
      and a golden discus in the other
      and took the form of a man-lion,
      went to Hiraṇyan and split open his chest.

2113. If devotees remove all faults from their minds,
      meditate without blinking their eyes,
      avoid the pleasures of the five senses,
      and embrace only him in their hearts,-
      they will reach the heaven of the lord,
      resting on Adishesa, the thousand-mouthed snake.

2114. The good-natured lord, giving his grace to all,
      taught the Vedas to Brahma so Brahma could give them to the world.
      What is the use if you just recite his names
      and do evening rites without thinking of him in your mind?

2115. O cloud-colored one,
      you swallowed all the seven worlds
      and slept on the banyan leaf.
      The cowherd mother Yashoda whose eyes are large and beautiful,
      fed you milk from her breasts
      without worrying that you had drunk milk from the devil Putanā.
      All people say that your deeds are true.

2116. O tall one, do not think that we are blaming you—
      what we say is because of our love for you.
      Didn’t the ten-headed Rāvaṇa oppose you
      because he wanted to reach your feet?

2117. With a golden discus in your hand
      you fought with Hiraṇyan and split open his chest,
      and you asked for three feet of land from Mahābali at his sacrifice
      and measured the world and the sky.
      Didn’t you do this because you wanted
      to remove the strength of your enemy kings?

2118. In the Thiruvenkaṭam hills,
      the favorite place for Thirumāl who blows a white conch,
      the Vediyars recite the Vedas
      and the learned ones proficient in the good sastras
      carry fragrant lamps, flowers and water,
      come from all directions, go and worship him.

2119. The hill where the Asurans and the gods
      come and worship Thirumāl who, shining like a jewel,
      killed the snake and conquered the heroic elephant of the gypsies
      is Thiruvenkaṭam where the clouds with lightning float.

2120. The lord who rests on the wide ocean
      split open the earth to save the earth goddess,
      carried Govardhana mountain to save the cows and the cowherds,
      frightened the Asuran Kamsan and conquered him
      and abides in the Thiruvenkaṭam hills.
      If I want to recite his names, they are so many.

2121. It is the Thiruvenkaṭam hills
      where gypsies with fine bows and arrows
      carry hot fires in their hands
      and the elephants see them and leave the forest,
      frightened because they think they are stars falling from the sky.
      It is there that the lord stays
      who rejoiced when he conquered the Asuras.

2122. O my heart, even if our mistakes are as large as hills,
      the lord with a golden discus in his hand
      will not be angry with us.
      He will only feel happy for the good qualities that we have.
      From today, even if all the heroic deeds of the lord
      are only untrue gossip,
      you should always think of them as true and believe them.

2123. Even though Lakshmi, the goddess of wealth,
      the earth goddess and the daughter of the cowherd family love him,
      the heart of the ocean-colored god resting on the snake bed
      embraces only Lakshmi from the milky ocean.

2124. If devotees carry flowers and water
      and go to him to worship his feet,
      the fault in their minds and the results of their bad karma
      will disappear
      and they will achieve whatever they want.

2125. In whatever form the devotees wish to see him,
      he will appear to them in that form.
      Whatever name the devotees want to call him
      happily he will have that name.
      When they meditate on him quietly without blinking their eyes,
      whatever color they think he has,
      he will appear in that color, carrying his discus.

2126. The gods in the sky may not know him, but let that be.
      O good heart, we know his heroic nature.
      When Ravana disguised himself pretending he had only one head
      and asked for a boon from Brahma,
      Thirumāl came in the form of a baby,
      and, lying on Brahma’s lap, he counted all the heads of Ravana
      so that Brahma would know the Raksasa Ravana
      was the one asking for the boon.

2127. When the skull of Nānmuhan,
      the giver of the Vedas to the world,
      was stuck to the palm of Shiva when he wandered
      as a beggar wearing a white thread,
      Thirumāl cut his own body
      and poured his blood into the skull of Nānmuhan,
      to release Shiva from his curse.
      If devotees worship our lord, they will rule the earth
      and enjoy their lives like gods in the sky.

2128. If devotees control their five senses
      that are as mighty as rutting elephants,
      not allowing them to wander
      and keeping them on a good path,
      they will see with true wisdom the lord's ankleted feet
      that once saved the snake when it was in distress.

2129. He carries a conch in one hand and in the other
      a fiery discus that he threw at the Asuras
      as the gods and the Asurans looked on and were terrified.
      O heart, be happy that we could reach the divine feet of the lord.

2130. It is not possible for devotees
      to see the ancient cloud-colored god
      adorned with a shining golden crown,
      unless they are born many times on this earth in various forms
      that change like the colors of a peacock's wings.

2131. The lord received three feet of land from generous Mahābali
      after taking water from his hands and grew tall
      to measure the earth and the sky with his two feet.
      If devotees control their five senses
      and worship him sprinkling fresh flowers,
      it is easy for them to see him

2132. The lord came in the form of a man-lion
      and fought fiercely with the matchless Hiraṇyan and killed him.
      If you wish to see his feet,
      make your thoughts pure,
      think and worship him reciting his divine names,
      and he will present himself to you.

2133. The eight Vasus, eleven Rudras,
      twelve suns and two Asvins
      carry beautiful flowers and go to Thirumāl everyday
      to adorn him with garlands, folding their hands
      and worshiping him always.

2134. When Thirumāl walks the snake Ādisesha is his umbrella,
      when he sits he is a throne for him
      and he is his sandals when he stands.
      He is a floating bed for the god on the ocean always,
      a beautiful lamp, a soft silky dress,
      and the pillow the lord loves to rest on.

2135. He is the lovely-eyed lord
      who conquered the snake Kālingan,
      fought with the elephant Kuvalayābeeḍam,
      killed the Asurans when they came as kurundam trees,
      split open the beak of the Asuran that came as a bird,
      killed the wrestlers sent by Kamsan,
      drank milk from the breasts of the devil Putana,
      danced the Kuravai dance,
      carried Govardhana hill as an umbrella
      to protect the cows that he grazed and the cowherds,
      and ate the food that was offered for Indra.

2136. The devotees of the god of the gods who rests on the ocean
      will not have any troubles
      no matter what bad or good acts they have done—
      they will be always his devotees.
      Even if the messengers of Yama search for them
      they will not be able to find them.

2137. Who could see the wonderful lord?
      People can only prattle his names.
      Even though he was sitting on the lotus on his chest
      Brahma could not see Kaṇṇan’s lotus feet.

2138. When I was afraid
      that I would experience the results of my bad karma,
      I came to the divine feet of you with your beautiful garlands,
      learned to say your mantra “Namō Nārāyaṇā!”
      praised you and worshiped you.

2139. O heart, rise and come,
      let us carry lamps and flowers and worship him.
      All the mantras and any sastras that you have learned
      are only to worship the feet of Thirumāl.
      There is nothing more than that.
      Let us go to worship the feet of the lord.

2140. If you want to remove the results of your bad karma,
      other troubles in your life, sickness and sin,
      your only refuge is Rāma
      who opposed and fought Rāvaṇa in Lanka
      and killed him with his bow
      when that king of the Rakshasas
      kidnapped his wife with a waist soft as a vine.

2141. Nānmuhan seated on a lotus on the navel of Thirumāl
      gave the Vedas to all the creatures of the world
      surrounded by the oceans,
      yet even he does not know the path to moksha.
      Only Thirumāl knows that and he is the refuge for all.

2142. The world, the end of the eon that destroys the world, ,
      the matchless dark oceans, the hills,
      fire in the world, , the wind and the sky
      all were created only by Thirumāl with his wisdom.

2143. The arms of the god resting on the snake Adisesha
      hold the discus that killed the Asurans
      when he went through the two marudam trees,
      broke them and made them fall,
      they killed the Asurans
      when they came as beautiful kurundam trees,
      and they conquered the seven bulls so he could marry Nappinnai.
      They reached out to all the eight directions
      when the lord took the form of a dwarf
      and measured all the seven worlds and the sky.

2144. My hands worship nothing but him.
      My ears hear only his sweet words .
      I will not think of any pleasure
      except praising the sounding anklets on the feet
      of the lord whose arrows never miss their targets.
      Anyone should feel ashamed to desire any pleasure but that.

2145. I do not desire the wealth of others or join with mean people.
      I make friends only with good people.
      I do not feel amazement at the deeds of any god but Thirumāl.
      How could any bad karma come to me?

2146. The lord stays far away and is hard for anyone to know.
      If devotees worship the feet
      of the dark-colored lord with beautiful eyes and a thousand names
      they will not experience the results of their karma
      and they will not go to cruel hell.
      They will never, even for the shortest time, involve themselves in bad deeds.

2147. The songs that the world learns when it wakes up,
      the pāsurams of the Vedas that the Vediyars recite,
      all things that the world recites, thinks, and worships
      are the names of him with a discus in his hand.

2148. Wise devotees look only towards him,
      the beloved of Lakshmi seated on a beautiful lotus,
      just as the rivers go toward the sea,
      beautiful lotus flowers turn toward the sun,
      and lives move towards Yama. ?

2149. O lord, you stay in the sky,
      you are on the earth,
      you abide in the Thiruvenkaṭam hills
      and you are in the recitation of the four Vedas.
      Who can know the milky ocean where you rest?
      Who can know your power?
      Who can know your form even in all the eons.

2150. People say it is true that when you were a baby
      you swallowed all the seven worlds and lay on a banyan leaf.
      Where was that banyan leaf?
      Was it in the ocean? Was it in the sky?
      Was it on the earth?
      Tell me, O god who carried Govardhana mountain
      surrounded with groves.

2151. Praise Thirumāl for as long as you can speak.
      Worship him until your body leaves the world.
      It is good if you worship him
      adorning him with flower garlands, performing sacrifices,
      reciting his names and saying mantras
      and doing any other deeds you can as praise to him.

2152. O strong heart,
      even if I remain healthy without any sickness and old age
      and rule the whole world for all the four eons,
      I only want the love of the lord with a heroic discus.

2153. My heart says, “Love the lord with a discus in his hands,”
      my tongue says, “Praise and worship his divine arms,”
      my eyes say, “See the lord without birth”
      and my ears say, “Hear the fame of the lord, adorned with lovely ornaments.”

2154. O heart!.
      You may praise or blame him who is adorned with thulasi garlands,
      you may admire him or scold him.
      He is the flourishing water of the ocean, the hills, the wide sky,
      the wind, the body and life of all creatures.

2155. Shiva rides a bull and Thirumāl rides Garuḍa,
      Shiva burned the three forts
      and Māl split open the chest of Hiraṇyan,
      Shiva wears sacred ash and our lord has a sapphire color,
      Shiva has Shakthi for half of his body and Thirumāl has Lakshmi seated on his chest,
      Shiva has long matted hair and Thirumāl is adorned with a large crown.
      Shiva has the Ganges in his matted hair
      and Thirumāl measured the world with his long legs.
      May they both protect us.

2156. If devotees worship him
      they will not experience the results of their karma
      and any troubles that come to them will go away.
      If devotees meditate on him, they will not become old
      and if they worship his feet,
      they will find good paths in their lives.

2157. If devotees follow good paths and worship the lord
      they will be like the three faultless gods in the sky
      and Thiruvenkaṭam of the wonderful lord
      who measured the world and the sky
      will give moksa to them.

2158. All your troubles will go away
      if you praise him saying,
      “You stand in Thiruvenkaṭam,
      you are seated in Vaikuṇtam,
      you recline in Thiruvekka
      and you walk in the beautiful golden
      Thirukkovalur filled with ponds.”

2159. O heart, rise.
      We will take fresh flowers from a punnai tree,
      sprinkle them on his feet, fold our hands
      and worship him who rests on the thousand-headed snake Adisesha.
      He killed the cruel crocodile to save the elephant Gajendra
      when he called the lord for help.
      Who will have any affliction if they worship him?

2160. Who will blame the one who gives
      and not the one who receives?
      Did you not ask for three feet of land
      and receive the boon with water poured on your palm
      from Mahābali and did you not grow tall
      as your beautiful ornamented foot touched the high sky?

2161. A snake terrified of an eagle, his enemy,
      ran to the ocean where you rest and asked for refuge,
      and you, the dark colored Māyavan, the strong one,
      helped it with your generosity.
      Who could help like that except you?

2162. When the gods fought with the Asuras and asked your help,
      he churned the milky ocean with them
      using Mandara mountain as a the stick and Vāsuki, the snake as a rope,
      and he gave them the nectar that came out of the ocean.
      Isn’t his name the weapon that saves from cruel hell?

2163. O Venkaṭam, you are the hill where lord stays
      who shot his arrow and killed Mārisan
      when he came as a golden deer.
      Women with sword-like eyes go there
      to worship the lord with fresh flowers and garlands
      carrying lamps whose brightness
      hides the light of the stars in the sky.

2164. You rest on the ocean and you hurl your strong discus
      at your Asuran enemies, killing them,
      but you were born as Kaṇṇan
      and with compassion you carried
      Govardhana mountain with your arms and saved the cows.
      You fought with the seven bulls
      and conquered them to marry Nappinnai.
      What heroic deeds you have done!

2165. O lord, who knows your power?
      You measured the world with your feet,
      yet you found that same world so small
      that you could carry it on your tusk
      when you took the form of a boar
      to bring the earth goddess from the underworld.

2166. O heart, controlling your five senses,
      you carry water and worship him in the proper way,
      but do you know the place where he rests on the snake bed?
      Do you know where his eagle flag is? Tell me.

2167. O lord, you, the generous one, carried Govardhana hills
      to save the cows and the cowherds from the storm.
      As you stay with Lakshmi in the beautiful Thikkovalur temple,
      do you stay at the entrance, in the middle or inside?

2168. All countries worship him, knowing how
      he threw the calf at the vilam tree and killed the Asuras.
      Lock the doors of hell!
      If the devotees worship his ankleted feet
      they will not go there.

2169. I look only for your divine feet,
      I only sing your fame
      and I worship only the golden feet
      of you with a shining discus.
      How could anything hurt me?

2170. There is no one who can match my dear lord.
      Since I have his grace how could anyone be equal to me?
      The blooming dark kāyām flower is fortunate
      to have the same beautiful dark color that he has.

2171. O Mādhava,
      Hiraṇyan thought that he had
      the boon of not being killed by a man
      and he did not want to worship your feet bowing his head to you.
      Though he was as strong as you, you were able to kill him
      taking the form of a man-lion.

2172. He took the form of a boar and split open the earth.
      If devotees do not remove
      the darkness in their hearts and inside their bodies,
      lighting up their wisdom everyday
      and worshiping the feet of the lord,
      they will not attain moksha.

2173. O Thirumāl!
      You are the sky, fire, the rolling ocean,
      the wind, honey, and milk.
      Was your stomach that contained the world before you spat it out
      full when you swallowed the butter
      that Yashoda the cowherdess churned and kept?

2174. Carrying in your handsome flower-like hand a golden discus,
      you split open the stomach of Hiraṇyan
      when he came to fight with you
      unsheathing his sword, as you opened your mouth wide
      showing your teeth and terrifying him. Why?
      Did you get angry at him to destroy his pride?

2175. Māyavan showed the sages all the worlds he had swallowed,
      opening his mouth wide and his eyes like fire.
      My tongue will not praise any other except him.
      even for a moment.

2176. The words “Namō Nārāyaṇā”
      that you say with your tongue without stopping
      are the way to attain everlasting moksha.
      Why is it that people cannot understand this
      and go in wrong ways?

2177. O heart, know and understand this well.
      The beautiful eyed- Thirumāl is both dharma and sin.
      He is the earth, the ocean with rolling waves, wind and sky.
      Worship him.

2178. Compassionate, you saved the elephant Gajendra
      so he could live with his mate.
      Didn’t the golden Ganges receive Thirumāl’s grace
      before she flowed as a fiery river
      into the spreading matted hair
      of Shiva who wears vibhuti?

2179. Even though both the divine Shiva
      with a body that shines like gold and thick matted hair
      and Neḍumāl who measured the world and the sky with his two feet
      have two different forms
      one is inside the body of the other.

2180. O good heart, if the devotees meditate
      on the faultless eternal lord of Thiruvenkaṭam,
      he enters their hearts.
      Understand that Thirumāl resting
      on Ādisesha in the milky ocean
      is in your heart.

2181. O my heart, if you keep in your mind
      the Māyavan, Kesavan adorned with cool thulasi garland,
      who kicked Sakaṭāsuran with the same shining lotus feet
      that measured the world, you will attain moksha.

Mudal Thiruvanthadi ends.

---------------
## 14. Second Thiruvanthaathi. Buthaththāzhvar (2182 -2281)

2182. My love for him is a lamp,
      the oil in the lamp is my desire to worship him,
      and the wick is my sweet mind that melts for him.
      I light the shining lamp with my wisdom.
      I composed this Thiruvandāthi for Naraṇan
      in divine Tamil.

2183. If you stay in a good place
      and recite the names of Nāraṇan,
      understanding him well with your wisdom,
      the nature of the king of the gods is to give you
      the privilege of being a god among the gods in the sky.

2184. If devotees worship sprinkling fragrant flowers
      on the feet of the god resting on the milky ocean,
      they will enter the shining world of the ancient god of the gods
      where only the gods in the sky can enter.

2185. I string garlands with jewels, pearls,
      diamonds and fresh flowers,
      carry matchless beautiful lotuses, and worship the feet
      of him on whose chest Lakshmi seated on a lotus
      on the right side of his body.

2186. You asked for three feet of land as a boon
      from Mahābali at his sacrifice
      and measured the world and the sky with your two feet.
      O Neḍumal, you are colored like the ocean rolling with waves!
      Who is able to know the power of your feet and speak of it?

2187. If good-hearted devotees control their five senses,
      do much tapas with love, sprinkle fresh flowers
      and worship him reciting his names
      they will see the ankleted feet of the ocean-colored god.

2188. When he raised his ankleted feet
      and fought with his enemies Namusi and others
      with his heroic discus,
      he scared them and made their minds burn.
      O heart, worship happily his divine golden lotus feet.

2189. When Putana took you in her lap
      and gave milk from her beautiful breast saying, “Drink happily,”
      you pretended to drink her milk and killed her.
      Even though she came as a mother and gave milk to you,
      you killed her because she had come to kill you.

2190. Yashoda was not worried about giving you milk
      from her breasts with love
      even though she saw how you killed
      Putana when she came and fed you milk.
      Is even this ocean-encircled earth that you measured
      equal to the love of that cowherd mother?

2191. O lord, I think always of you
      who kicked and killed Sakaṭasuran
      when he came as a large cart
      and protected the world.
      You asked for three feet of land from Mahābali
      and took over the whole earth and saved its people.
      I worship you with my tongue,
      sprinkling flowers on your feet.
      The results of my karma are gone.

2192. Many people worship the feet of other gods
      and enjoy life only for a short time,
      but they do not worship you to attain eternal moksha.
      O Neḍumal with the color of the ocean rolling with waves,
      who can describe the might of your feet?

2193. If any of his devotes worship him will reach
      the feet of him resting on the snake bed.
      He treats everyone equally.
      Even the bright sun that goes around the world,
      Nānmuhan on a lotus
      and Shiva with a forehead eye
      worship the lord every day without ceasing.

2194. When the large elephant Gajendra
      went to the pond to pick up a beautiful lotus flower to worship him
      he was caught by a crocodile,
      and the lord came and saved him, killing the crocodile.
      Wasn’t Gajendra saved and so he could reach the world of Indra,
      because he worshipped the feet of the lord with a discus?

2195. O ignorant ones, do not praise the people
      of the world who perform many evil deeds
      increasing their karma.
      Recite the names of the lord who grew to the sky
      and whose hands were extended in all the eight directions.
      Wander as sages and go to all the temples
      where he stays, worship him and become faultless.

2196. Are these the things the lord enjoys—
      driving the chariot in the terrible battle for Arjuna,
      -chasing Marisan to catch him when he came as a golden deer,
      losing Sita when she was kidnapped by Rāvaṇa
      and resting on the beautiful snake bed Adisesha on the ocean?

2197. When he enters someone’s heart
      and a devotee locks him in it,
      the lord may not know that he is imprisoned in the devotee’s heart.
      If someone does not dig out a pond on a mound in a forest
      and save the rain water, there will be no water to flow and nourish the fields.
      Lock him in your heart.

2198. Indra, the king of the gods, and Nānmuhan on a lotus
      worshiped him and asked him to help them when they were in trouble.
      Like them, Shiva with thick matted hair adorned with the crescent moon
      went to Thirumāl, asked for his aid and received his grace
      when the skull of Nānmuhan was stuck to his hand.
      Who but our lord could have helped them all?

2199. Thirumāl took the form of a dwarf
      went to Mahābali’s sacrifice, grew tall
      and measured the earth and the sky,
      he took the form of a man-lion
      split open the chest of Hiraṇyan with his claws,
      and he swallowed all the seven worlds in the eon.
      Did Thirumāl with beautiful eyes do these things to save the world?

2200. When Sakaṭasuran came as a cart, you kicked it and killed him,
      but that is not all you did.
      You also threw the calf on the vilam tree and killed the two Asurans.
      The world may blame you for breaking a cart or throwing a small calf,
      but you only did these things to protect the world.

2201. If your devotees do not sin or do bad deeds,
      and only praise you
      because they recite your name Narayaṇā without mistake
      and understand your power, worshiping only you,
      they will live happily.

2202. Our lord, the beloved of Lakshmi, abides in the hearts of those devotees
      who always think of him and worship him.
      They have the good fortune of bowing to the feet of the lord
      who took the form of a dwarf
      and they will never go to cruel hell.

2203. Didn’t the dark Gajendra, the large elephant with white tusks,
      worship him with beautiful flowers and get what he wanted?
      If someone wants to achieve something,
      it will be easy for him if he truly tries like Gajendra.

2204. The lord who threw the calf onto the vilam tree
      and killed the two Asurans,
      went to Mahābali's sacrifice in the form of a dwarf,
      grew tall and measured the world and the sky with his two feet.
      If devotees worship him and live following good paths,
      he will give them a good life.

2205. O good heart, he is happiness and sorrow in life.
      He is the five senses and he is the wind, fire, water, sky,
      the dark mountains, the ocean with waves and burning fire.
      He is everything.

2206. He, famed since ancient times, the creator of the Vedas,
      praised by the gods in the sky,
      went to Lanka angrily, fought with the Raksasas
      and killed their king Rāvaṇa.
      He has come to stay in the Thiruvenkaṭam hills
      where bamboo plants grow on the cool slopes.

2207. He rests on Adishesa on the ocean,
      and in the Venkaṭam hills where his devotees
      who have controlled their five senses,
      their feelings and their minds come and worship him.
      He gave the hills to the gods
      so that they can come, live there and worship him.

2208. My mind searches for Thirumāl CHECK
      the god of Thiruvenkaṭam hills,
      like a vine climbing on the wall
      that grows towards the sky
      looking for a stick to support it.

2209. The ocean-colored lord
      stays in Thiruvenkaṭam and in Thiruvarangam,
      a place that is hard to conceive.
      He split the mouth of Kesi when he came as a horse
      and he is praised by all as the god of the gods, abiding in the hearts of all.

2210. You shot your arrows and destroyed southern Lanka.
      You killed Putana when she came as a mother
      to give you milk from her breasts.
      Yet even though your mother Yashoda saw all these heroic deeds
      she was not afraid to give you her milk.

2211. People say, “O ocean-colored Thirumāl!
      You measured the world at Mahābali’s sacrifice,
      became a boar and split open the earth
      to bring the earth goddess up from the underworld,
      churned the wide milky ocean, took nectar and gave it to the gods,
      and made a bridge on the ocean
      and went to Lanka to fight the Raksasas.”

2212. If the devotees go every day in the morning taking fresh flowers
      and worship the feet of the beautiful lord
      who took the form of a beautiful boar
      to bring back the earth goddess from the underworld,
      they will see the lord’s shining form and be happy.

2213. O Thirumāl, my heart is happy
      seeing you and worshiping your feet.
      I am happy to sing and dance,
      and your conch and fiery discus are happy seeing me
      when I worship you.

2214. When I bow to the feet of the lord
      adorned with many thulasi garlands,
      my heart feels happy.
      I praise the heroic one with my tongue
      the god of the Thiruvenkaṭam hills
      where bamboo grows on the slopes.

2215. As a dwarf you asked for three feet of land from Mahābali
      and when he gave it, you measured the world and the sky with your feet.
      I worshiped you lovingly with fragrant smoke and fresh flowers
      and became your slave. This is my good fortune.

2216. People say passion is sweet but water is sweeter.
      O father, if people do not want passion or water
      and only listen to your heroism
      that will be the water that protects them.

2217. Mean people can achieve fame only by doing mean deeds.
      They know nothing.
      O my heart, worship our Māyan
      who swallowed the earth and spat it out
      and be calm.

2218. You created the four-headed god,
      the creator of the Vedas
      who stays on a beautiful lotus on your navel.
      If we do not praise your divine feet and bow to you
      we will have only trouble in all our births.

2219. Do not think you have much wealth
      and depend on it to make your life without trouble.
      You should think Mādhavan is yours and keep him in your heart.
      Reciting his names with your tongue is just like reciting the Vedas.

2220. O ignorant people,
      know how to praise the names of the good lord.
      That is what the Vedas say.
      If you follow what you have learned from the sastras that is good.
      If you cannot do that,
      just say the names of Mādhavan—
      that is really the meaning of the Vedas.

2221. Before Yama comes and throws his rope and catches you,
      think of the names of the lord.
      You know that real happiness is to worship the feet of the lord
      with Lakshmi on his chest.
      There is no other thing could bring you happiness
      except to know the lord and worship his feet.

2222. No one can enter the world of the gods just by wealth.
      The only way to attain moksha is by his grace.
      O heart, don't forget his sapphire-colored feet
      that give moksha to divine sages.
      Always meditate on his names.

2223. I think of Thirumāl always.
      If devotees worship and meditate on the wide arms of the lord,
      they will not have any future births.
      Just by worshiping him
      the sages get all the happiness
      that those receive who were born
      to enjoy family life in this world.

2224. He shot his arrows and cut off
      all the twenty arms, ten heads and two feet
      of Rāvaṇa and killed him.
      The only good use of my arms is to worship
      the feet of the devotees who worship his feet.

2225. For good devotees,
      the names of beautiful-eyed Thirumāl are a true help.
      I will not consider those who forget him as human beings.
      Keep in your mind the name Mādhavan,
      the god of dharma, and recite his names—
      that is the only good thing that you should do.

2226. The lord of Thiruvenkaṭam
      worshiped by the gods in the sky
      is himself the Vedas
      whose meanings are endless.
      If devotees worship his feet
      they will have no pride whether they are rich or poor.

2227. The generous sapphire-colored lord
      stays in Srirangam, Thirukkoṭṭiyur
      and in his favorite place, Thiruvenkaṭam.
      He is lord of beautiful Thirumālirunjolai
      and Thiruneermalai flourishing with abundant water.

2228. Folding your hands with devotion in your heart,
      worship him in the morning when you get up
      and sprinkle flowers on the feet of him -
      who took the form of a man-lion and fought with Hiraṇyan,
      -measured the world at Mahābali’s sacrifice,
      -swallowed the world and spat it out
      and split open the earth to bring the earth goddess from the underworld.

2229. O Thirumāl, you taught the sages all the four Vedas
      and the sastras that teach morals.
      Embracing Lakshmi on a lotus on your chest,
      you stay happily on the beautiful Thirumālirunjolai
      surrounded with beautiful large groves on its slopes
      where bamboos grow.

2230. O my heart! Praise him and call to him without fear, saying ,
      “You drank the poisonous milk from the breasts of Putana
      as the seven mountains, seven worlds and the seven sounding oceans
      were all shaken.”

2231. I will call Thirumāl with his faultless names saying,
      “You are the cowherd adorned with precious ornaments,
      the Yādavan, the Māyavan, loved by all.”
      In front of everyone I am calling Mādhavan with love
      in the same way all the cowherds call him.

2232. O heart,
      Think of the feet of the lord who has the sapphire color of the ocean
      and recite his wonderful names.
      Worship the feet of him who churned the milky ocean
      and gave nectar to the gods

2233. The dark-colored one
      with Lakshmi on a beautiful lotus on his chest
      is the lord of dharma.
      He sent the evil king Rāvaṇa
      who fought valiantly with his sword
      to the world of Indra, the king of the gods in the sky.
      Who knows how he gives his grace?

2234. I would go and worship the lord in Thiruvenkaṭam hills
      where the blooming creepers think
      that the thick hair of women
      falling low on their backs
      are small hills and cling on to it to grow.

2235. O lord, you wish to stay
      in the Venkaṭam and Thirumālirunjolai hills
      surrounded with thick groves.
      Like those hills, I make my heart your temple,
      worship you and say,
      "Do not leave my heart, for it is your young temple
      and it is like the milky ocean for you.”

2236. You are wise and carry a heroic discus.
      In all my seven births I have never forgotten you—
      and I have been mindful of you.
      Give me your grace so I may plunge into the ocean of joy.

2237. If one gazes at the grass growing on the shore of the ocean
      and tells it to be shy, will it become shy?
      (Lakshmi, the goddess of wealth, shows her golden body
      before our Thirumāl shows his dark body to us.)
      OR Lakshmi shows the dark body of Thirumāl to us
      before Thirumāl shows his body to us.

2238. Praise him with your tongue
      who embraces Lakshmi on his chest
      and gives his grace to all.
      Have you heard? Devotees from all the directions
      praise the name of our lord and worship his feet,
      because it is our right to praise him.

2239. Because of my good karma,
      Saraswathi stays in my good heart
      and has taught me what to do.
      She gives her grace and tells me,
      “Just as margosa, even though it is bitter, gives good health,
      the golden discus which the lord carries to fight his enemies
      is only to only protect the world and the gods.
      Praise his golden discus!”

2240. I worship his devotees with my good heart
      and no longer do wrong.
      My evil thoughts have gone away
      and I think only of his beautiful lotus feet,
      meditate on him and worship him.

2241. You do not have only one form.
      A shining form is yours,
      and the vast world says you have two forms.
      See, if devotees know your ancient form
      they will rule the world with justice.

2242. People say that as a thief
      you took the form of a bachelor dwarf,
      went to king Mahābali and asked for three feet of land.
      You measured the world with one of your feet
      and raised the other foot and touched the sky,
      as your arms extended to all directions.
      How fortunate they are who described you like this!

2243. I did not have the fortune of worshiping you,
      and I did not receive your grace because I was not wise.
      I only praised and worshiped you saying things which are not true.
      O, bull of the cowherds! You broke the horns of the seven bulls
      and conquered them to marry Nappinnai.

2244. If I were to describe how our father
      conquered the seven bulls to marry Nappinnai
      and how he poured his blood into Nānmuhan’s skull
      that was stuck to Shiva’s hands and made it fall,
      they would be long stories.

2245. O Kaṇṇa, all the stories that anyone tells,
      no matter what they are about,
      are only about you and nothing else.
      My heart wants to praise you.
      You are the stories and the divine words in them.
      Give me your grace so I may understand your stories.

2246. I worship your divine body,
      I bow to your beautiful lotus feet with love
      and I worship you folding my hands.
      I searched for you, my refuge,
      and know that the best life for me
      is to praise and live where you are.

2247. See, O good heart,
      this birth is what has happened to us.
      If we praise the names of Nārāyaṇan
      resting on the ocean on a snake bed,
      that will be the way to avoid going to hell.

2248. I saw his divine body in a dream,
      his hands and the fiery discus that he carries
      and found that he is the strength
      that will remove the results
      of my good and bad karma
      and the troubles of my life.

2249. He, the king broke the tusks of the elephant Kuvalayaabeeḍam,
      used big Mandara mountain as a churning stick
      and the enormous snake Vasuki as a rope, churned the milky ocean,
      and gave the nectar to the gods,
      cheating the strong Asurans with sharp teeth.

2250. Even the kings of famous countries
      who ride horses have been devotees
      of the lord for their seven births.
      on whose navel Nānmuhan abides on a lotus,

2251. The places of our heroic lord,
      skilled in shooting arrows and conquering his enemies,
      are the hearts of his devotees,
      divine Srirangam, the cool milky ocean,
      Thirukkaḍalmallai praised by devotees,
      Thirukkovalur and Thirukkuḍandai surrounded with walls.

2252. When the lord who rests on the poisonous snake Adishesa
      raised his flower-like feet, grew to the sky and measured the world,
      the conch in his left hand sounded loud and his shining discus
      that conquers his enemies shot out fire in the sky.

2253. The monkeys in the Thiruvenkaṭam hills
      enter the ponds where flowers bloom, bathe,
      take flowers place them on his feet and worship him.
      O heart, come, let us go there, recite his divine names,
      place the flowers on his feet and worship him.

2254. When the elephant Gajendra
      with tusks like crescent moons and angry eyes
      was caught by a crocodile,
      our lord went to the pond, killed the crocodile and saved him.
      I have decided to become his slave,
      praising his thousand names
      and placing fresh flowers on his feet every day.

2255. I have received the fruit of all the tapas of seven births,
      for I have composed a wonderful garland of Tamil pāsurams
      and placed it at his feet.
      I am fortunate to have written them in fine Tamil.

2256. The lord colored like a cloud
      stays in the Thiruvenkaṭam hills
      where a male elephant dripping with ichor
      plucks bamboo sticks, soaks them in honey
      and gives them to his mate.

2257. It is good for us to take the sandal paste from the hills,
      precious ornaments, silk clothes,
      and fragrant white jasmine flowers
      and offer them at the feet of the wise ancient lord.

2258. O good heart, if we worship the faultless lord
      offering beautiful lotus flowers at his beautiful feet
      and reciting his thousand names and praising him,
      that is the only tapas we need to do.

2259. When he grew, measuring the world and the sky,
      Nānmuhan was the only one who had the fortune
      of washing his golden feet with the water of the Ganges
      and embracing and praising him with all his divine names.

2260. When Rama’s mother Kosalai asked him
      not to go to the forest he did not listen to her,
      and when his wife Sita, soft as a flower,
      told him not to go, he did not listen to her either.
      Wanting only to obey his father’s order, he went to the forest.
      The strength he showed then was equal to when he measured the world.

2261. I have become his slave, love him
      and think only of his divine lotus feet
      lovely as lotuses dripping with honey.
      The joy of worshiping his feet is sweeter
      than the joy of seeing his form.

2262. I saw Nārayaṇan in the day and in my dreams at night,
      and again I saw him truly.
      I worship the beautiful shining feet of the lord
      who carries a discus smeared with flesh
      and his bright form in the sky.

2263. Lakshmi with lovely long sword-like eyes
      sees his divine form all the time as she stays on his chest.
      Why does the earth goddess feel jealous of her?
      The beauty of his form will never be reduced
      no matter who sees him.

2264. With my poor words I worship Thirumāl
      whom the Vedas praise with their divine words
      thinking that Māyan might somehow accept me
      and give me a small bit of his grace.

2265. The lord went as a man-lion and killed Hiraṇyan
      who had the boon that no one could kill him
      and afflicted the gods, not obeying anyone.
      It is like drinking nectar in this beautiful world
      to worship his feet.

2266. I worshiped him saying,
      "He is nectar. He is honey.
      He carries a discus. He churned the milky ocean,
      got the nectar and joyfully gave it to the gods.”
      I praised and worshiped the lord with a garland
      of words sweet as nectar.

2267. Poets cannot see him,
      they can only praise him with garlands of words.
      Even sages doing true tapas cannot see the cloud-colored god.
      What kind of tapas I could have done that I see him now?

2268. Do I know only today the feet of the lord
      who measured the world?
      When I was in my mother’s womb itself I knew him
      and worshiped him with folded hands.
      I know the power of my father, the god of Thirukkoṭṭiyur.

2269. I know that the only way to reach our father,
      the god of Thennarangam, is to leave family life
      and think of him always.
      If devotees follow the divine path,
      they will not go to cruel hell
      and the guarded door of the gods’ world will open for them.

2270. Did you, who were angry with Kamsan, fought and killed him,
      and fought with elephant Kuvalayaabeeḍam and broke its tusks,
      go to Mahābali’s sacrifice as a dwarf
      and ask for three feet of land in ancient times just to take over the world?

2271. Won’t I rule this world
      and go to the world of the gods
      and stay with them in the sky
      if I go and worship lovely-eyed Neḍumāl of Thirumalai?

2272. The ocean-colored lord who saved the Vedas
      received a boon from Mahābali
      and measured the world and the sky with his two divine feet.
      If you worship him, he will give his grace
      and you will not have to worry about hell.

2273. Neḍumāl with a Garuḍa banner,
      and is praised by the gods in the sky
      killed Kamsan by kicking him with his feet.
      If you worship him and praise his names
      quickly you will find how to receive all that you wish.

2274. Hell is cruel and if you collect bad karma
      you will go to the most cruel of hells.
      Before any such terrible thing happens to you,
      worship without ceasing the lord with a conch in his hand
      who split open the mouth of the Asuran when he came as a bird
      and drank the milk of Putana and killed her.

2275. My heart bows to his feet
      and worships the cloud-colored god of beautiful Thiruppāḍagam,
      who split open the chest of his enemy Hiraṇyan
      and swallowed all the seven worlds,

2276. O my heart, all the world praises
      the sapphire-colored lord of Thiruvathiyur
      who split open the chest of the Asuran Hiraṇyan,
      swallowed all the earth at the end of the eon
      and spat it out again to save it.

2277. The highest lord of Athiyur who rides on an eagle
      and rests on the ocean on Adishesa with diamonds on his head,
      is the god of the three sacrifices and the Vedas.
      He is the lord of Shiva who drank poison
      that came from the milky ocean
      and he is also our dear lord.

2278. You, lovely-eyed Neḍumal, king of the gods in the sky,
      abide, embracing Lakshmi on your chest,
      in the temple of Kuḍamukku
      resting on the ocean on thousand-mouthed Adishesa.

2279. The lord who was born on the earth,
      raised in a cowherd village as Nandan’s son,
      grazed the cows, danced on a pot
      and swallowed all the earth
      stays in my heart

2280 . Thirumāl with beautiful eyes went as a dwarf
to Mahābali’s sacrifice and measured the earth and the sky
with his two feet, making Mahābali his slave
as the gods in the sky sprinkled flowers on his divine feet
ornamented with sounding anklets and asked him for his grace.

2281. O Thirumāl, Neḍumāl, Kaṇṇan,
      adorned with a wonderful thulasi garland
      and lord of the gods in the sky,
      who threw a calf at the vilam tree and killed the Asurans,
      my love for you has no limit.

Bhuththāzhvār pasurams end

-------------------
## 15. Third Thiruvandādi – Peyāzhvār (2282 – 2381)
2282. I saw today the divine form of the ocean-colored lord,
      his golden body adorned with jewels
      that shone with the color of the bright sun
      and the golden discus in his hands that fights in war
      and the sounding curving conch.

2283. Today I saw his ankleted feet
      and now I will not be born again for seven births.
      O Thirumāl with a mountain-like golden chest ,
      You are adorned with a cool thulasi garland,
      and you embrace your beloved Lakshmi from the milky ocean.
      I find you with love in my heart.

2284. The ocean-colored lord stays in my mind
      who, angry at his enemies on the battlefield,
      fought with them and killed them.
      His chest is adorned with thulasi garlands,
      and he rests on a snake bed on the wide ocean and embraces Lakshmi.
      He is the remedy that will save me from going to hell.

2285. The feet of the lovely-eyed lord
      who swallowed all the seven worlds and spat them out,
      measured the earth and the sky
      and received a boon from Mahābali for three feet of land
      are wealth, nectar and remedy for all.

2286. The feet of the lord with a discus
      who measured the world are lotus-colored,
      his body has the color of the ocean that surrounds the world
      and the brightness of his crown is like the sun on its chariot.
      All these things make him beautiful.

2287. It is lovely to see his ocean-colored body,
      it is lovely to see him cross the world with his feet,
      it is lovely to see Nānmuhan who stays on a lotus
      and brought the Ganges to wash the feet of Thirumāl
      after the lord took water in his hand
      to get three feet of land from Mahābali
      so that he could measure the earth and the sky.

2288. O heart, come, let us worship the feet of the lord
      who measured the world surrounded with dark ocean.
      He rides on Garuḍa and flies around the groves.
      He is hard for anyone to understand
      and he is inapproachable for all.

2289. O good heart,
      let us worship him folding our hands
      and recite his many names,
      praising him and saying, “ Nārāyaṇā!”
      May our eyes see only Kaṇṇan,
      adorned with a cool thulasi garland swarming with bees
      who swallowed all the worlds and spat them out.

2290. His eyes and hands are like lovely lotuses
      and he has beautiful lotus feet that measured the world.
      The shining body of the lord has the color of a cloud,
      the ocean and a precious sapphire.

2291. If people praise the brightness, strength,
      beauty, form, faultless family and all other things of the lord
      with a beautiful white conch in his right hand
      and if they recite his names, all goodness will come to them.

2292. He is in the four Vedas that are recited by all
      and he has the color of a waterfall descending quickly
      and filled with honey.
      He carries a sounding conch in his hands
      and rests on the snake bed Adisesha on the milky ocean.
      He is the knowledge of the learned ones
      of the ocean of sastras.

2293. Devotees who cultivate knowledge,
      recite the Vedas well, control and close the door
      to the feelings of five senses
      and meditate on the beautiful ocean-colored lord
      will see his nature every day in the world.

2294. In ancient times
      when Thirumāl went to Mahābali’s sacrifice as a dwarf,
      took water in his hands and asked for three feet of land
      and received it,
      he grew tall and measured the world
      and his crown split the sky.

2295. If devotees who have given up the desire to embrace women
      learn the sastras and put their minds on the lord of Thiruvenkaṭam
      praised by all the four Vedas
      and worshiped in the sky by the gods
      whose crowns touch the feet of the lord,
      they will reach him easily.

2296. Our father, resting on the ocean rolling with waves
      on Adisesha whose head bears jewels,
      came and stays in my heart
      and I became his slave.

2297. My father shining like a beautiful lamp
      of red corals and precious pearls
      born in the ocean rolling with white waves
      stays in Thiruvallikkeṇi
      embracing vine-like Lakshmi’s chest.

2298. All the days I have lived in the past,
      and the days I live in the present and the future
      are good days if I constantly praise the lovely-eyed Thirumāl.
      May my mouth praise him.

2299. O Neḍumāl,
      you went to Mahābali’s sacrifice as a dwarf,
      asked for three feet of land, received it,
      and grew to the sky and measured the earth and the sky.
      Give me your grace so that all of my fears will go away
      and I will be a slave to your feet in all my seven births.

2300. He was born as a child and slept on the banyan leaf
      at the end of the eon, and gave his grace
      to his devotees who, without any faults in their minds,
      sprinkled fresh flowers on his feet,
      folded their hands, stood before him and worshiped him.
      How could not give his grace to his devotees now?

2301. O Thirumāl, you, the tall god with beautiful eyes,
      swallowed all the worlds and spat them out in ancient times.
      How could it have been difficult for you to measure
      the earth and the sky with your two feet at Mahabali’s sacrifice?
      O divine lord? Tell us all about it.

2302. When the Asuran Vakkaran came to fight with our lord,
      who is adorned with a fragrant thulasi garland
      and carries a shining discus in his right hand
      and a conch in his left, he killed the Asuran.
      He will present himself in whatever form
      people wish to think he has.

2303. O heart, the beautiful gods in the sky adorned with crowns
      sprinkle fragrant flowers on his feet and worship him,
      and you, O devotees, should worship the lord the same good way
      following the sastras, and with your hearts melting.

2304. I worship his feet ornamented with golden anklets,
      my mind enthralled with the lord
      adorned with a thulasi garland swarming with lovely-winged bees
      that make buds bloom when they blow on them.

2305. O heart, worship every day the ankleted feet
      of the lord with a beautiful shining discus in his hand.
      He is the blowing wind, the wide earth,
      the sky where clouds float, strong fire and the ocean.

2306. O, heart, there is nothing wrong if you worship the lord
      who swallowed all the earth and kept it in his stomach,
      ate butter that lovely-haired Yasodha churned and kept,
      conquered the seven bulls for Nappinnai,
      and is praised by all the gods in the sky.

2307. The lord, adorned with a cool thulasi garland
      and resting on beautiful-eyed Adisesha,
      stays in my devoted heart
      and in famous Kachi, Thiruvenkaṭam, Thiruvekkaa, and Thiruveḷukkaippāḍi.

2308. How could they have any troubles
      if his devotees reach and worship the dark ocean-colored lord,
      the origin of everything, who churned the milky ocean
      and rests on the sea on Adisesha?

2309. The highest lord, our father resting on the snake bed,
      drank milk from the breasts of the devil Putana,
      fought the Bharatha war to help the five Pandavas,
      and was spanked with a churning stick
      by the cowherdess Yasodha when he stole the butter.

2310. Without being afraid the cowherdess Yasodha
      took and embraced dark-colored Kaṇṇan
      and fed him milk after he had drunk the milk of the devil Putana
      as a beautiful baby prattling with his sweet coral mouth.

2311. Thirumāl adorned with a thulasi garland
      and resting on Adisesha on the ocean
      stays in Kudanthai surrounded by the sea,
      in Thiruvenkaṭam, in my pure mind, in the divine sky, in Iṛaipāḍi
      and in beautiful Pāḍaham where Vediyars recite the Vedas.

2312. The lord who stays on the milky ocean
      on the earless serpent Adisesha worshiped by all the four Vedas
      and took the form of a man-lion and split open the chest of Hiraṇyan.
      He shares his body with Shiva adorned with a snake in whose hair the Ganges flows.

2313. Gopalan who broke the Kurundam trees and killed the Asurans
      abides on Adisesha on the milky ocean, in Thiruvenkaṭam,
      the cool sky, all the sastras, the mind of Lakshmi,
      the hearts of the sages plunged in yoga
      and in my heart.

2314. O Thirumāl, it is true
      that you swallowed all the seven worlds
      at the end of the eon,
      lay on a banyan leaf as a baby,
      churned the milky ocean with Mandara mountain
      and gave the nectar to all the gods in the sky.

2315. O heart, see!
      The faultless lord who killed the Asuran Kamsan
      stands in Thiruvezhukkai,
      and recline- on Adisesha on the ocean.
      Is he exhausted because he measured the world
      at Mahābali’s sacrifice?

2316. My eyes say, “I want to see him, I want to see him!”
      Folding our hands, we sing his praise
      and worship the shining golden feet
      of the god resting on the ocean
      whose golden body is adorned with rich shining ornaments
      and a thulasi garland swarming with bees that sing.

2317. The dark ocean-colored Māyan
      who measured the world and the sky
      with his two feet and rests on the cool ocean
      carries a fiery discus in one hand,
      and a white conch in the other,
      and a heroic club, a bow and a shining sword.

2318. I became the slave of the lord colored like the rolling ocean
      who is inside and outside of all,
      with shining jewels
      and coral-mouthed Lakshmi on his divine chest.

2319. Even though all forms in the world are his forms,
      he can be compared only to himself.
      Our lord, the Māyan whose form is tapas
      is all the stars, burning fire, the eight directions, tall hills
      and the shining sun and moon in the sky.

2320. Our lord is in the hearts of all
      who is the earth, the eight directions,
      the Vedas, the meaning of the Vedas,
      the sky, and the god of the Thiruvekaṭam hills
      where pure waterfalls descend with a lovely sound.

2321. O heart, the faultless lord,
      the king who measured the world,
      is in the hearts of all his devotees
      and in the Thiruvenkaṭam hills
      with peaks that touch the sky
      and waterfalls flowing with abundant water.

2322. When the lord who carried Govardhana mountain
      as an umbrella to protect the cows and the cowherds
      measured the world,
      his diamond-studded crown touched the sky,
      his hands extended in all the eight directions,
      his ankleted feet encircled all the thick groves of the earth
      and his dress shone like lightning.

2323. The sapphire-colored Kaṇnan who grazed the cows
      and played the flute killed the Asuran when it came in the form of a horse.
      When the lord was angry at Hiraṇyan, he took the form of a man-lion
      and split open his chest with his sharp claws.

2324. The lord who embraces the earth goddess on his chest
      and fought with the angry elephant Kuvalayaabeeḍam
      and broke its tusks
      swallowed all worlds into his stomach.

2325. He is the world, the eon, the ocean
      the shining sun and moon and red fire.
      O heart, worship the feet of the lord happily,
      whose pure golden crown shines with bright rays.

2326. Thiruvenkaṭam where a strong bull elephant
      fights lovingly with his mate
      and wanders angrily, spilling pearls from its white ivory tusks
      is the hill of the lord
      who swallowed all the earth in ancient times.

2327. When the lord churned the milky ocean
      using Mandara mountain as a churning stick
      and the snake Vasuki as the rope,
      pulling the rope with the gods on one side
      and the Asurans on the other,
      the water rose up and touched the sky.

2328. O lord with beautiful eyes,
      when Mahābali promised to give you three feet of land
      you took it and grew tall and measured the whole earth and the sky.
      Adorned with a thulasi garland,
      you split open the mouth of Kesa when he came as a horse.
      You close the door of hell and save us so we do not enter it.

2329. Didn’t you make Mahābali pour water on your hands
      and promise to give you three feet of land
      when you went to him as a dwarf
      and measured the world and the sky with your two feet?
      Didn’t you graze the cows?
      Didn’t you split open the mouth of the horse?
      And didn’t you go between the marudu trees and fight with Devasuran?

2330. With curved conch in your hands,
      you fought with your enemy Hiraṇyan and killed him,
      you asked for three feet of land from Mahābali
      took over the earth and the sky,
      and you fought with seven bulls
      to marry Nappinnai.

2331. O Thirumāl, when the elephant Gajendra
      was caught by a cruel crocodile in a spring filled with beautiful water,
      you, the beautiful dark-colored Kaṇṇan
      adorned with a shining jewel-studded crown and thulasi garlands,
      killed the crocodile and saved the elephant.

2332. He protected the cows and the cowherds
      with Govardhana mountain when there was a big storm
      and broke the marudam trees when Asurans came as those trees.
      As Rama, he fought the Raksasas and burned Lanka.
      He will give you moksha, the divine place where there is no sorrow.

2333. The lord shot his arrows and destroyed the seven marā trees,
      and he took the form of a dwarf, went to Mahābali and took over the sky and the earth.
      When Ravana, the king of Lanka took Sita, ornamented with beautiful jewels,
      our lord, as Rama, went to southern Lanka. fought with Ravana and killed him
      and brought his wife back.

2334. The lord who slept on a banyan leaf on the ocean
      as a magic child at the end of the eon
      swallowed the earth and the flood of water.
      O heart, worship the feet of him
      adorned with a cool thulasi garland.

2335. The lord kicked Sakaṭasuran when he came as a cart,
      went between the Marudu trees when the Asurans came as those trees,
      breaking them and killing them,
      and he took the form of a boar, split open the earth,
      brought up the earth goddess and loved her.
      The love that he has for Lakshmi
      whom he embraces on his chest
      is more than the love that he has for the earth goddess.

2336. The lord with lovely long eyes
      like lotuses swarming with singing bees
      wears many jewels on his large mountain-like chest
      so it looks like a dark cloud glittering with lightning.

2337. We do not know
      whether our god’s color is white, red, green or black.
      If one thinks about it only Saraswathi, the goddess of art,
      could equal the beauty of the god
      who is the beloved of Lakshmi.

2338. With beautiful Lakshmi on his chest
      he is like lightning shining in the dark sky.
      People should understand that worshiping the feet of the dark god
      who rides on Garuḍa is the only devotion they need.

2339. Know that the god who asked for three feet of land from Mahābali
      and took over the world and sky with his cleverness
      stays happily in the Thiruvenkaṭam hills
      where a female monkey tells her mate sitting on a small hill,
      “Catch the white moon and give it to me.”

2340. I found the way to survive
      worshiping the feet of the dear lovely-eyed sapphire-colored lord
      adorned with long thulasi garlands that make him look
      like a dark mountain on which a waterfall flows.

2341. Our god blew his conch and conquered his enemies on all battlefields,
      protected the cows from the storm with Govardhana mountain,
      went between the Marudam trees and destroyed them,
      broke the cart when Sakaṭasuran came in that form,
      drank the milk of the devil Putana
      and threw the calf at the vilam tree and killed the Asurans.

2342. Just as Thiruvenkaṭam, the milky ocean and Vaikuṇṭam
      are ancient temples where the lord stays,
      now Thirukkaḍigai surrounded with flourishing groves
      swarming with bees is the divine heavenly place of the young lord.

2343. The lord who took three feet of land from Mahābali and measured the world
      after receiving a promise from him with water poured on his hands
      stays in Thiruviṇṇagaram, in Thiruvekka surrounded by ocean with rolling waves,
      in Thiruvenkaṭam, in Maṇṇakaram, in Thiruveḷukkai filled with beautiful palaces,
      in Thirukkuḍanthai in the south,
      in sweet Thiruvarangam surrounded with groves dripping with honey
      and in southern Thirukkoṭṭiyur.

2344. My father, the god of Thirumalai
      where waterfalls flow with abundant water
      has only one form that combines
      Shiva with his long jaṭa, shining golden mazu,
      and a snake around his neck
      and our Thirumāl with a tall crown, a discus, and golden thread.

2345. Using the snake Vasuki as a rope
      and Mandara mountain as a churning stick
      he churned the milky ocean,
      took nectar from it and gave it to the gods.
      Is he so tired because of that
      that he reclines in Thiruvekka, sits in Kānji
      and stands in Thiruvaragam?

2346. Our father who broke the tusks of the elephant
      Kuvalayābeeḍam and killed it
      went as a man-lion in the evening
      and angrily split open the chest of Hiraṇyan
      and protected Prahaladan, the son of Hiraṇyan.

2347. The Asurans Madhu and Kaiḍava
      were destroyed when Adisesha with jewels on his head
      merely breathed on them.
      If anyone becomes the enemy of the god
      and their end will be like that of Madhu and Kaibadava.

2348. The lovely lotus on the navel of the lord
      thinks that the shining discus in his right hand is the sun
      and the white conch in his left is the moon
      and, confused, opens and closes at the same time.

2349. The lord who threw the calf at the Vilam tree
      and destroyed the Asurans
      stays in Thiruvenkaṭam hills where a monkey
      that plucks a fruit from a vilam tree,
      sees his own shadow in the water of a spring,
      thinks another monkey has his fruit
      and extends his hands and asks the shadow monkey to give it.

2350. Her mother says,
      “My daughter sings the praise of Thiruvenkaṭam
      whenever she thinks of any hills.
      She wears thulasi on her dark hair thinking
      that is the best thing for a chaste women to wear
      and she goes to bathe in the large ocean every morning
      thinking that it is the milky ocean
      where broad-armed Thirumāl rests."

2351. The elephant in the Thiruvenkaṭam hills
      who washes his teeth with his ichor,
      washes his hands and legs with the water from the waterfalls,
      and carries blooming flowers that drip honey
      goes, sees and worships the heroic lord of Thiruvenkaṭam.

2352. The lord who threw a calf at the vilam tree and killed the Asurans
      stays in the Thiruvenkaṭam hills
      where an elephant, thinking that a cloud is an enemy elephant,
      runs and tries to fight it and a yāḷi, seeing the elephant,
      screams in anger and kills the elephant
      as the sound echoes through the hills.

2353. Our young lord stays in Thiruvenkaṭam hill
      where the bamboo sticks that gypsy girls
      with round bangles throw as they play, rise up to the sky
      and release the shining moon from its curse.

2354. It is the best thing for our tongues to praise him
      who drove a chariot yoked to seven horses and danced on a pot.
      To worship the feet ornamented with sounding anklets
      of the god of Thiruvenkaṭam is a good thing for us.

2355. He drank the milk of the breasts of cruel devil Putana
      and made her fall to the ground,
      but the cowherdess Yasodha took him on her lap
      and fed him milk, keeping him at her breasts.
      Isn't her love beautiful?

2356. In the divine Thiruvenkaṭam hills
      where the blossoms of vengai tree spread their fragrance,
      an angry tiger sees the rabbit in the floating white moon
      against the red color of the sky, thinks it is a real rabbit
      and becomes angry because it could not catch it.
-
2357. You do not need to stand on a hill,
      plunge into water or stand near five sacrificial fires to reach him.
      If you sprinkle flowers, folding your hands,
      and lovingly worship the god of Thiruvekka,
      all your bad karma will disappear.

2358.The Raksasa Rāvaṇa who slept on the lap of Nānmuhan as a baby
and received boons from him, his grandfather,
carried a shining sword and fought with Rama,
and Rama cut off all his ten crowned heads
and made them all fall on the earth.
Rama's lotus feet are the refuge of us, his devotees.

2359. We should not think, “Where is our refuge?
      Where can we go? Are we going to be born again and again?”
      Praise and worship the heroic lord
      who destroyed the strength of his enemies with his discus—
      he is our only refuge.

2360. If devotees control their five senses
      and keep in their minds
      only the dark ocean-colored lord
      with a fragrant thulasi garland on his chest
      they will not be born again.

2361. My heart tries to approach the divine feet of the lord
      resting on the snake Adisesha
      with a shining discus that conquers all
      and who fought with Vānāsuran, riding on a jeweled chariot
      and cut off his thousand arms.

2362. O my firm heart, even though it is difficult to think of him,
      think and praise him without worrying.
      He is in you and will not move from there.
      Why are you unable to know him.?
      Why do you do not feel him?

2363. If you want to be aware of him it is hard
      and it is impossible for you to see him
      even if he enters your heart.
      Where can I go to see the lord, the king
      adorned with a cool thulasi garland swarming with bees
      and dripping with honey?

2364. Even though people praise Māyan saying
      that he is sweet, no one can see him,
      yet the sweet ankleted lord, stays inside your heart
      who became a dwarf, went like a thief
      and measured the earth and the sky at Mahābali’s sacrifice.

2365. People think of him and say,
      “He is the meaning of the four Vedas
      and he is in our hearts and we feel him,”
      but who has seen the cool lotus-eyed Māyavan?
      How could one describe him in their poems?

2366. In their poetry, poets worship the lord,
      describing the beauty of his form,
      and the devotees hear them
      and come to worship him in all his temples.
      Even if the poets and the people of the world praise the beauty of the lord
      who conquered the seven bulls to marry Nappinnai,
      will their words be enough to praise his divine shining beauty?

2367. Beautiful clouds that flash with lightning,
      roaring with thunder, show the color of dear Neḍumāl,
      and the dark sky where clouds float together
      looks like his dark color also.

2368. O lord ornamented with shining jewels
      and a cool thulasi garland strung with bunches of flowers
      that swarm with bees,
      your body blooms like a flower and shines like an emerald,
      and the evening sky has your color.

2369. Worship the golden ankleted feet of the lord
      who is adorned with a cool thulasi garland dripping with honey.
      If you do not have doubts, saying, “This is good, this is bad.”
      you will not collect more karma in future
      and your past karma will go away.

2370. The lord who plays sweet music on his flute
      is the god of Thiruvenkaṭam
      where gypsies plant millet seeds in the fields
      that grow along with bamboo that rises and touches the sky.

2371. When Thirumāl, adorned with a beautiful thulasi garland,
      grew tall and touched the rivers in the sky with his divine foot
      at the sacrifice of Mahābali as his silambu and his anklets rattled,
      his eight arms hurt as they extended in eight directions
      because the space of the whole earth was not enough for them.

2372. The young lord swallowed the earth at the end of the eon,
      drank poisonous milk from the breasts of the devil Putanā,
      and when Yasodha the cowherdess tied him with a rope
      because he stole butter, even though it hurt him
      he did not get upset and kept quiet.

2373. O heart, worship the ankleted feet of the dark-colored Māyan,
      the unborn, divine one who was raised by Nandan, the chief of the cowherds.
      As Kaṇṇan he fought with Vānāsuran when Anurudhan took Usha
      and cut off his thousand arms.

2374. Thirumāl swallowed all the worlds,
      kept them in his stomach at the end of the eon
      and slept on a banyan leaf as a baby on the flood.
      Who knows what will happen to this world?
      O heart! Keep the lord inside you.

2375. I light the lamp of knowing and feel him
      in my heart and keep him there.
      The Māyan, standing, sitting and lying in different temples,
      entered my heart and stays there always.

2376. O heart, worship his divine feet and praise Thirumāl
      who went to Hiraṇyan in the evening as a man-lion
      and split open his chest with his sharp claws
      as his blood flew all over.

2377. As the gods in the sky bow to him
      their jewel-studded crowns
      mark the lotus feet
      of the beloved of Lakshmi.

2378. Could the gods
      Nānmuhan who stays on a lotus on his navel,
      Shiva with long matted hair,
      and Indra, colored like a kānji flower,
      ever be able to think of him in their hearts even for a moment?

2379. The lord who is the snow-covered mountains,
      the wide sky, the wind and light
      killed the Asuran Kesi when he came as a horse and protected us.
      He will save us from Yama when he comes to take us.

2380. Our refuge is the feet of the god of Aṭṭapuyaharam
      who fought and conquered all his enemies
      and killed the murderous crocodile with his discus
      when it caught the elephant Gajendra.

2381. The dark cloud-colored lord with a discus is always our refuge.
      Our lord with a tulasi garland on his mountain-like chest
      has lovely lotus eyes that shine like lightning in a dark cloud
      as he embraces Lakshmi who is on a flower dripping with honey.

---------------
## 16. Thirumazhisai Alvar - Nāmuhan Thiruvandāthi. (2382 – 2477)

Nārāyaṇan created Nānmuhan.
Nānmuhan created Shiva.
O, heart! If we say this we will survive.
Praise the feet of the poet Thirumzhisai.

2382. Nārāyaṇan created Nānmuhan
      and Nānmuhan created the five-faced Sankaran.
      I composed andadi poems praising him.
      Learn and understand the deep meaning
      of each of these pāsurams without omission.

2383. People say if one searches for a god,
      they will find only one god
      whose greatness no one knows.
      The search and the meaning of all things is the only our god.
      If the sages desire to find the lord, his grace will help them.

2384. Who knows the god resting on the milky ocean,
      staying in Srirangam or sleeping on a banian leaf?
      Who knows the one unique thing in the world,
      the real truth for the gods in the sky as I know?

2385. Every one knows the Ganges flows in Shiva’s matted hair,
      and that he shares half of his body with his wife Girija,
      but our dear lord, the real truth for the gods in the sky
      is alone in this world, without any one sharing him.
      I wish to praise him, the meaning of all words.

2386. O dear mighty-armed Thirumāl,
      you split open the chest of Hiraṇyan
      who had received many boons.
      Never defeated by any of your enemies,
      you created the four Vedas in the world
      and hold inside yourself all the important gods,
      human, animals and plants.

2387. The Jains are ignorant.
      The Buddhists are tired of trying to spread their religion.
      The devotees of Shiva are small people.
      Those who do not praise the Māyavan,
      Thirumāl, Mādhavan are not good people.

2388. Whether it is today or tomorrow
      or even a little time after, your grace is always with me.
      I do not see refuge except you.
      O, Nāraṇa, see, I am not without you,
      and you are not without me.

2389. O heart, there is no help for me except
      the lovely-eyed Thirumāl who conquered Shiva and took his bow
      and cut off the ten heads of the king of Lanka with his sharp arrows,
      destroying the pride of Lanka.

2390. Let us worship the beautiful feet of the lord of the world
      who heard the request of Shiva,
      poured water from the pot of Nānmuhan,
      recited a mantra from the Vedas
      and made the skull of Nānmuhan
      fall from the palm of dark-necked Shiva.

2391. Even Nānmuhan on a lotus
      and Shiva with long matted hair
      were not able to see the head or foot
      of the lord with a golden body
      resting on soft fire-spitting Adisesha.
      How can we see him?
      We can only worship him.

2392. Fold your faultless hands
      and worship our ancient Thirumāl,
      adorned with a tall shining crown and thulasi garlands.
      Let your mouth praise him. Let your eyes see him.
      Let your ears hear him.
      Bend your crowned heads
      and worship him sprinkling cool flowers.

2393. You made the sages who do not worship you
      have many births,
      you released the moon from his curse,
      and you freed the elephant Gajendra from the mouth
      of the terrible crocodile in the deep pond
      and gave them both moksha.

2394. O sages, you do tapas, make your bodies weak
      as if they were small empty cages and you suffer.
      You do not know the path that leads to moksha.
      He, moksha, is the truth, the meaning of the ancient Vedas,
      the most excellent thing for the gods in the sky,
      Nārāyaṇan himself.

2395. Nārāyanan, my ruler, saves me from entering hell.
      If people listen to the teachings of other religions like Jainism
      they will fall into hell
      and the world will not praise them.

2396. If you place flowers on his feet,
      and praise and worship the highest lord of the world
      worshiped by many gods,
      you will find the way like Markaṇḍeyan
      to whom our god gave life
      when Shiva with the Ganges flowing in his hair
      went with the boy to see the lord.

2397. My heart always worships
      the god of the gods who hid the bright hot sun
      with his discus in the Bharatha war
      and destroyed the many enemies of the Pandavas.

2398. Shiva the lord of true tapas
      taught the path of dharma
      under the shadow of banyan tree
      to the four Nāyanmārs in the last yuga.
      He truly worshiped Thirumāl who measured the world,
      rests on Adisesha on the ocean,
      and rested on a banyan leaf as a baby at end of the eon.

2399. If a devotee does a tapas worshiping him
      who came in the form of a man-lion
      and split open the chest of the Asuran Hiranyan with his sharp claws,
      that devotee will overcome the benefit of any tapas
      that his enemies have done.

2400. You with a discus
      destroyed the boons that Hiranyan
      and other Asurans received doing tapas to Nanmuhan,
      and you are pleased to protect and save us.
      Since you are the protector of all creatures,
      even a fly that worships you will go to Vaikuṇṭam.

2401. You are the world.
      and everything in the world abides through your grace.
      You are the god of gods that one achieves by tapas,
      the sacrificial fire, tall mountains,
      the eight directions, the bright sun and the moon.

2402. When you took the form of a man-lion,
      did your cave-like mouth open and shoot out fire?
      Did your round eyes become red?
      Is this the beauty of the highest god of the gods in the sky
      who took the form of a lion
      that looked like blazing fire?
      Is this the beauty that all saw?

2403. He was born as a child,
      he took the form of a fish,
      and he has the nature of all the seven worlds.
      When he, the seed that gives life to all,
      came as a man-lion, he was beautiful.
      You know him, and you worship his feet.

2404. He fought and killed the seven bulls to marry Nappinnai.
      Does one need to sow seeds to reach moksha
      in the good land of the farmer, our lord?
      The sky that pours rain has the color
      of the divine body of the dark cloud-colored Thirumāl.

2405. You have the colors of milk, gold, green and a dark cloud
      and you fought with the two wrestlers and destroyed them.
      You drove the chariot for Arjuna,
      advised him to fight the Bharatha war bravely
      and helped the Pandavas win the war.

2406. It was not right for you to come as a dwarf,
      cheat Mahābali, take his lands,
      and destroy the pride of the king
      who took a potion made of diamonds
      and thought no one could conquer him.
      What do you get by this sort of deed that destroys others?

2407. You are the ocean colored Thirumāl.
      Shiva with thick matted hair is my witness
      that I do not want to worship anyone but you.
      Give me your grace always
      so I may know and worship only you.

2408. O ignorant ones,
      our Thirumāl has entered my innocent heart—
      how can I worship any other god?
      I tell you that I am able to see
      the divine feet of him decorated with garlands
      that even Shiva with the Ganges in his matted hair
      could not to see.

2409. See, this is the Sethu bridge
      that he built to destroy the pride of Lanka.
      See his power that killed Vāli, the monkey king.
      See, his pride that destroyed with his arrows
      Rāvaṇa, the king of Raksasas making his body tremble.

2410. Our lord shot his one arrow
      and killed Kumbakarnan with long eyebrows.
      He will be happy if you praise him
      whose form is brightness and joy.

2411. The god of Srirangam
      who rests on the flood on the snake bed Adisesha
      stands, sit and reclines in my heart always
      and saves me from all my troubles.

2412. O, devils, Nāraṇan removed the curse
      that Nānmuhan gave Shiva
      and if you do not worship him,
      the god of the gods in the sky where stars shine,
      that is just the same as believing a story that is not true.

2413. Even though it is a story
      that when Thirumāl swallowed the world all the creatures survived
      because he kept them in his stomach and protected them,
      if someone does not praise him and doubts his power
      how could he reach his feet and be saved?

2414. The purpose of the lord who came to the earth
      and grazed the cows was to kill Sakaṭāsuran,
      to dance on the heads of Kālingan,
      to catch the tusks of the elephant and kill it,
      and to drink poison from the breasts of the devil Putana.
      He fought with the seven strong bulls
      to embrace the arms of Nappinnai
      whose mouth is as beautiful as coral.

2415. My aim is to praise the god of Thirukkoṭṭiyur.
      and receive good life from him.
      Will I ever hate the lord of Thiruveṇkaṭam?
      I will worship his feet,
      for he saves me from any sickness that I may have
      and removes the results of my bad karma.

2416. The divine one of Thiruvallikkeni, as beautiful as a peacock,
      who rests on the five heads of the snake Ādisesha
      where the large waves of the dark ocean roll and dash on the shores
      is quietly lying now without opening his mouth.
      Is he tired because he measured the world with his feet?

2417. The ancient Neḍumāl
      lovingly rests on the snake bed
      in Kudanthai, in Thiruvekka, in Thiruyevvul,
      in Srirangam and on the milky ocean.
      If devotees embrace him, he will enter their hearts too.

2418. The wind, the sky, the wide oceans,
      the tall mountains, the hot sun that moves across the sky,
      the cool moon, the clouds that float in the sky,
      the eight directions and the earth
      all flourish through the wish and grace of Thirumāl.

2419. The ocean-colored lord
      created six religions for the people by his grace.
      If he becomes angry he will destroy at once any evil gods
      who create troubles or do bad deeds.

2420. She says,
      “I call the god of Thiruvenkatam hills
      where the large waterfalls descends like rain, bringing bright jewels,
      and elephants are frightened when they hear the sound of the water
      and snakes are scared and hide
      when they see the brightness of the jewels.
      I wish to see him and make a divine kuḍal to get his love.”

2421. I praise Thiruvenkaṭam, the hill
      that is my home and where I stay.
      See, I always think of the lord of this hill.
      I fell into the net that is the divine feet
      of the beloved of Lakshmi,
      the goddess praised by all the sastras.

2422. O lord, you stay in my heart and in Thiruvenkaṭam hills
      where the waterfall that descends scatters pearls
      and roars as loud as the Onam festival.
      I am anxious to go and see you in the Thiruvenkaṭam hills.

2423. Thiruvenkaṭam hill has the power to destroy his devotees’ karma.
      Go and worship that tall hill that rises to the sky
      where Nānmuhan on the fragrant lotus
      and the three- eyed Shiva come and worship
      the lotus feet of the lord.

2424. Shiva wearing the crescent moon in his matted hair
      and Nanmuhan on a lotus
      enter in the night the northern Thiruveṇkaṭam hills
      that touch the clouds in the sky and worship him,
      offering him pearls and other things.

2425. In ancient times when he was young,
      with his toes he counted the ten heads of Rāvaṇa
      who had a mighty army.
      O young ones, go to the Thiruvenkaṭam hills surrounded with groves
      where Kaṇṇan stays, remaining always young.

2426. O, devotees, place flowers with love,
      on the lotus feet of the lord of Thiruvenkaṭam hills
      where a cool waterfall descends.
      He is the refuge for the gods in the sky
      and the people on the earth.

2427. In Thiruvenkaṭam hills
      elephants raise their trunks to the sky
      thinking they will touch the moon
      and make it as a bright light for our lord Thirumāl,
      and gypsies dance as they go around those hills,
      bending their bows and trying to catch the elephants.
      If people also will go around those hills and dance
      that would be wonderful.

2428. The Venkatam hills filled with aaḷis, lions, gold, jewels, pearls,
      blooming trees, waterfalls that are mixed with many jewels,
      forests, monkeys and hunters
      are where the sapphire-colored lord stays.

2429. Thiruvenkaṭam that removes the sufferings of karma
      is the hill where the gods in the sky come and worship Thirumāl
      and where our lord with the discus
      abides, protecting the gods in the sky and killing the Asurans.

2430. To praise the divine name of the wonderful god,
      who churned the milky ocean
      using Mandara mountain as a churning stick
      and the snake Vasuki as the rope
      is the only thing that all devotees should do.

2431. Māyan is in my heart
      and Yama will not come to me,
      cruel karma will not come to me
      and fire will not destroy me.
      Kaṇṇan who rests on the water on the bank of Kaviri river
      is in my heart that praises him.

2432. O my dear lord colored like a kāyām flower,
      there is no one to match you
      except yourself, my only refuge.
      Now that my mind has known you,
      it will not be content even with the heavens,
      for it understands you who are not understood by others.

2433. Those of other religions who wear garlands of skeletons
      will sell themselves for a price and beg for food.
      If they do not worship our lord
      who drank the poisonous milk of Putana,
      they are ignorant and what they drink is dirty.

2434. I will not worship any other god
      except Rama, the destroyer of Lanka,
      the land of the ignorant Raksasas.
      Do not accept and worship evil gods
      who are not divine and cannot give their grace.

2435. All that a person has learned is a waste
      if he does not worship Neḍumāl
      the only god, the most ancient
      of the all the three gods.

2436. If people stand at the doors of some gods
      worshiping their feet, they will be happy only at that time.
      O Neḍumāl colored like the ocean rolling with waves,
      how could they be capable of worshiping your feet?

2437. Someone may say this one is god or that one is god,
      but there is no one equal to the father of Kama, the beautiful prince.
      Neḍumāl fought and conquered Shiva
      who drank the poison from the salty ocean
      and his escort when they came to help Vānanāsuran
      and they all lost the battle with Thirumāl.

2438. The lord himself is good karma and bad karma.
      If I wanted to describe him
      who killed the Asurans when they came as Kurundam trees,
      I would say he is the stars, the gods, the Asurans
      and he is in my heart.
      Is there anything that he is not?

2439. He measured the world in ancient times
      as the king Mahābali saw his large form in terror.
      He is in my heart and has removed all my troubles.
      I give my love to the cowherd
      who took away the curse of the bull-rider Shiva.

2440. I am your devotee
      and you are my love and sweet nectar
      joy for me and everything else.
      You, the beloved of the goddess Lakshmi
      as beautiful as a golden statue
      are my Kesavan, my shining light.
      You protect me so that troubles do not come to me.
      I am your devotee and your servant.

2441. Devotees know that you will give moksha
      to those who deserve it and they
      approach you and worship your feet.
      You are Rangan, a precious thing for the devotees
      who worship you and ask for your help.
      My mind will not stop loving you.

2442. The lord, the ruler of the world
      fought with the seven bulls to marry Nappinnai.
      He is my treasure and I am with him.
      If you ask Madhusudan, the refuge for all, for refuge
      he will protect you
      and you will not have any trouble in your mind.

2443. The devotees of Thirumāl
      wear thulasi garlands swarming with bees
      as their god does.
      They will tell the other ignorant ones
      that the only god is Shridharan on whose chest Lakshmi stays.

2444. I have spent all my time reading about you,
      hearing about you, writing about you
      understanding you, praising you, worshiping you,
      and doing pujas for you who created the stars,
      and rest on Adisesha, the snake on the ocean,

2445. Real praise is to praise him only.
      Place flowers at his feet
      and worship the ancient god, the lord of the gods.
      The mantra that destroys all seven births
      is the names of Nāraṇan, the good lord.

2446. I praise Thirumāl, Madhavan,
      the mother of all with my poetry and in my heart.
      Is there not a place in Vaikundam for me
      who think always of him only? Tell me.

2447. My heart is the place of Neḍumāl
      resting on a snake bed.
      I will not think that Shiva wearing the crescent moon
      or Nānmuhan is equal to my god.
      I will not serve them or worship them.

2448. Even if I cannot circle the temple of god,
      or am not from a good family,
      if I praise the lord of the people Nāraṇan,
      the god of wisdom with good words,
      that will give me strength.

2449. Yama calls his messengers and tells them,
      “Listen to what I say.
      There are people who do not worship
      the divine feet of our god ever.
      Even if they bow to you as if they were saintly people,
      do not go away from them.”

2450. Sweet to ears is the name of the lovely-eyed god
      whose name is the refuge for all the people of the world.
      I worship him, the full meaning of all poetry.
      If one considers, the meaning of all the Vedas is only his praise.

2451. It is not just today
      that I have come to know the strength of the young lord,
      who measured the world and the sky
      and went to underworld as a boar, split open the ground
      and brought up the earth goddess on his tusk.

2452. The Māyan, the king of Dwaraka
      who was born as a cowherd
      is far away and is near, small and large.
      Those who do not know
      the words that the god said to Arjuna
      will live in the world without any true knowledge
      and will not be loved by others.

2453. The proverb may say,
      “If one has not had a family life, he cannot be a sage,”
      but that is not dharma.
      Good dharma, the four Vedas and tapas
      are all only the god Nāraṇan himself.
      Who can say this is not right?

2454. Who can understand the power
      of the god with a discus in his hand
      who swallowed the earth and spat it out?
      Dark-necked Shiva and eight-eyed Nānmuhan
      could not find the god’s feet or head.

2455. My tongue will not praise anyone
      but the dark cloud-colored Māyavan
      who gave his grace to the shining snake Sumugan
      when it came and asked for refuge
      because it was being chased by a hostile bird.

2456. I will not praise any human with my tongue,
      I will praise only the divine feet of the god of Vaikuṇṭam
      whom fire-bearing Shiva with his red matted hair
      comes and worships with flowers.

2457. Songs, literature, stories, the Puranas,
      fire, the large sky, the laws of Manu that all the world follows,
      and the four Vedas are only the creation of Māyan’s māyā.

2458. When the ocean-colored god
      who built a bridge with stones over the wide ocean
      wished to remove all my bad karma
      even though I do not know all the things I have done wrong,
      I worshipped him and all my sins went away.

2459. When Shiva who burned Madan’s body was doing tapas
      and Uma told him the name of Thirumāl,
      the god adorned with garlands,
      even Shiva’s tapas was disturbed.
      What will happen to people if they really see Māl and worship him?

2460. If devotees searching for Thirumāl
      understand the ancient lord with love in their minds
      and think of their bodies as a burden and wish to leave them
      they will quickly go to Vaikuṇṭam.

2461. When a terrible flood came in ancient times
      Kaṇṇan protected the world and gave it his grace.
      If you listen to the songs of this wide world
      and dance and praise him,
      that will save you from falling into a terrible hell.
      and will open the door to moksha.

2462. I thought that if I could open the door of my mind
      and see you there, all my bad karma would go away.
      You planted the seed of good Tamil in my heart and made it grow.
      You became that language itself that I have learned.

2463. The father of the beautiful Kama
      has entered my heart and lives there.
      Is there anything better than this could happen to me?
      Shiva and Nanmuhan sprinkle fresh flowers
      and worship the god, the king they cannot hope to equal.

2464. The dark-colored god with a discus in his hand,
      is the king of the gods in the sky, he is the sky, compassion,
      the people of the world, our mother and all things.
      He will give wonderful things to those who approach him.

2465. I do not want any wonderful thing to happen to me.
      I will not be a devotee of Shiva—
      he will not be the right god for me.
      I will only worship Kaṇṇan every day,
      the king whose feet are adorned with sounding anklets.
      Loving and worshiping him is my only duty.

2466. If I have any other duties, they are merely vexations.
      All I need is the time when I praise the names of Thirumāl,
      the god with a bow, who destroyed the pride of Vaali
      the angry, strong king of monkeys
      and who abides in my heart.

2467. See, my good heart, he is in you,
      the Uthaman is always in you,
      and if devotees think of him, he is in their hearts.
      He, the matchless one, is the Esan
      for those who are lonely,
      and for devotees like me.

2468. The lord ate the puja food served for Indra
      in a pile as large as the majestic Himalayas,
      he protected the cowherds from the storm,
      he created all the religions,
      and he protected the dark necked Shiva and Nānmuhan.
      He is the life of the world.

2469. When the messengers of Yama come and take someone’s life
      our god is the one who will come and save him.
      If devotees praise Thirumāl with songs
      and think of him always, they will live happily.
      The life of those who belong to other religions is a waste.

2470. I know for certain
      that to worship the divine feet of the god
      resting on the milky ocean is not a mistake.
      If devotees worship the god every day without unfailingly
      the results of their karma will not come to them
      and they will go to Vaikuṇṭam and stay there happily.

2471. Those who want to go to heaven
      will worship Thirumāl with flowers
      and live a good life,
      loving and serving others.
      They are the real devotees of the lord.

2472. I will sprinkle flowers on the lotus feet of all devotees,
      and the feet of the gods in the sky, of Nānmuhan who stays on a lotus,
      and of Shiva adorned with a snake,
      and I will worship them and ask them
      to give me their grace only so I may attain
      the lotus feet of the dark-colored lord.

2473 I do not ever forget Neḍumāl
who abides in my heart and will stay there for ever.
I am a devotee of Sridharan
with Lakshmi on his chest
and he has protected me from the time
I was in the embryo in my mother’s womb.

2474. I never forget that he protects me,
      I just say, “You are my Kaṇṇan” and stay quiet.
      You, the king, give bodies and your grace to all lives.
      You have the highest good nature.
      If devotees understand what truth is
      they will never leave you, the highest lord.

2475. O god resting on the snake bed,
      you destroyed the enemies of Pandavas
      and helped them on the battlefield.
      If you want, even neem leaves can be made
      into a delicious curry.
      Give your grace to me, your slave.

2476. I, your slave, was born in a low family and suffered.
      I do not want to worship gods other than you.
      I want to reach heaven,
      leaving this earth without my karma.

2477. I know now the lord of Shiva and Naanmuhan.
      I know you, my dear god.
      I know you are the reason for all.
      I know all I have learned is from you.
      I know all I will be knowing is from you.
      You are Nāraṇan and all your deeds are good.
      I know that very well now.

Nanmuhan Thiruvandathi ends.

## 17. Thiruvirutham. - Nammāzhvar (2478 -2577)
2478. The poet says,
      “O lord, chief of the gods in the sky,
      hear the request of your devotee.
      Remove my false knowledge, bad behavior,
      and unclean body and give me your grace
      so that I, born from my mother’s womb,
      will not be born in this world again.”

2479. Her friend says,
      “She loves the cloud-colored Kaṇṇan,
      the god of the gods in the sky.
      Her eyes are filled with tears,
      as if she were a fish
      frolicking in the water of a flourishing pond.
      May he prosper!”

2480. She says,
      “Worshiped by the gods, he wears a thulasi garland
      and my lovely heart goes behind him as he rides on the angry Garuḍa,
      carrying a fire-like discus that destroys his enemies.
      Nappinnai, the beautiful daughter of the cowherds who play the flute,
      the earth goddess and Lakshmi are with him like his shadow.
      Will my heart stay there looking at his beloved wives
      or will it return?”

2481. She says,
      “My lonely heart was attracted to his bird Garuḍa
      and went behind it.
      I have nothing to give to him who wears cool thulasi garlands.
      O cool poisonous wind!
      Is it right for you to blow
      and make me shiver for the love I have for him
      who drank milk from the breast of the devil Putana?”

2482. Her friend says,
      “The blowing of the cool wind is like fire,
      it doesn’t seem to know it is the cool season.
      Does he send it to make wide-eyed girls become pale?
      Does the cloud-colored Kaṇṇan
      make a rule for the wind to blow so cold?”

2483. He says,
      “This beautiful vine-like girl with sharp eyes like arrows
      and eyebrows like bent bows
      shot her arrow-look at me, her target.
      She is like the god who rides on Garuḍa,
      fought and conquered the Asurans,
      and is like Yama himself, and she is like his son Kama the god of love.
      Her love will take away your life.
      Protect yourselves.”

2484. She says,
      “The wind blows, the rain pours down
      and the clouds look like bulls fighting together.
      The earth is cool and the sky has the dark color of Thirumāl.
      Is this the rainy season that comes
      to make lovers suffer in separation?
      I don’t know. I have done bad karma.”

2485. She says,
      “All that I see and hear reminds me of my beloved,
      the chief of the mountain.
      I know that he wants to go far away,
      crossing the large mountain of Thiruvenkaṭam,
      to earn wealth, and it seems certain he will go.”

2486. He says,
      “Her face is like a lotus.
      She has shining dark eyes and lovely lips,
      her teeth are like white pearls,
      her eyes are like beautiful blooming kuvaḷai flowers
      and she looks like a beautiful doe.
      She is divine like the sky world of the god
      with a strong sharp discus in his hand.
      Who could bear to be separated from her,
      as lovely as a precious flourishing creeper?”

2487. He says,
      “O girls, you are as beautiful as the vines
      in the Thiruvenkaṭam hills in the north where Māyon stays.
      Even though I tell you how I suffer, you don’t listen.
      Are your mouths as beautiful as thoṇḍai fruit?
      Are you worried that if you speak,
      the parrots that hear you will feel shy?
      Tell me, I have done bad karma.”

2488. He says,
      “When I told her whose teeth are like white pearls,
      ‘You are like Kaṇṇan’s heaven.
      You eyes are very special.
      I need to be apart from you so I can gather wealth,’
      her large eyes like kendai fish shed tears
      and her precious golden body became pale.
      Now, all these things keep appearing
      and disappearing before me, making me suffer.”

2489. She says,
      “The pale color of my body increases.
      The nights seem as long as eons.
      My dear Kaṇṇan who has a beautiful discus
      and is adorned with a cool thulasi garland
      gave me all this pain
      because his good heart loves me.”

2490. She says,
      “The sun, the king of the day,
      the ruler of the earth with his scepter,
      has set and the heat and the light have gone away.
      The king of cold and darkness has come to rule.
      The cool wind coming from the thulasi garland
      of my beloved makes my bangles grow loose.
      Who will protect me? The night grows like an eon.”

2491. He says,
      “Her beautiful fish-shaped eyes that are sharp like spears
      have taken over my life.
      The bright light of Kama’s divine arrows
      will not leave me. They target my life.
      She is like the divine heaven
      of the shining dark-colored god.”

2492. Her friend says,
      “You came searching for an elephant and said to us,
      ‘You with fish-shaped eyes, did you see an elephant?’
      If others find out that you came here, won’t they gossip?
      We guard the millet field in Thiruvenkaṭam
      of the lord colored like the ocean or a cloud.
      You haven’t come for a while—
      every day for a long time we have guarded the millet field.”

2493. He says,
      “You are as precious as the sky where Kaṇṇan stays.
      When I am away from you, it seems as if many eons pass,
      but the time I am with you seems very short.
      Whether you are with me or away from me,
      I become weak.
      This darkness gives me much pain.”

2494. She says,
      “O ocean! You look like the darkness that is spreading.
      May you prosper with your abundant waves.
      The dark-colored lord resting on the snake bed Adisesha
      shines like a black sun that spreads its rays and take away the darkness.
      Do not erase the tracks of the wheels of the chariot on which my beloved rides.”

2495. Her friend says,
      “Does the sky look
      as if it has taken its water from the ocean and risen,
      or does the ocean look as if it has the color of the sky?
      Is it the time of the eon when the flood comes
      and he swallows all the worlds and the sky,
      or it is just the rainy season?
      The tears this girl sheds are like a waterfall.”

2496. Her mother says,
      “The dark clouds rise in the rainy season
      and their thunder seems to scream out,
      ‘Is there anyone to protect the chastity of these women?’
      If the lord adorned with a thulasi garland and riding on Garuḍa
      does not give his grace soon enough,
      the village will gossip about my little daughter
      whose words are few.”

2497. Her friend says,
      “O Velan! She is not sick because her words are few.
      Her sickness is not one that some young god has given—
      it is only because she has fallen in love with our lord.
      O Velan, stop your worship.
      O mothers, hear my words.
      Bring the cool thulasi garland from him
      who swallowed all the seven worlds and put it on her.”

2498. Her friend says,
      “The gods in the sky bathe you in pure water,
      adorn you with beautiful garlands
      and burn incense to you and worship you.
      You stole the butter in the cowherd village and ate it,
      and you fought the seven bulls with bent horns
      to marry Nappinnai, the daughter of the cowherd
      and you danced the kuḍakkuthu dance.”

2499. Her friend says,
      “He wears a dress made of leaves
      and in his hands he carries a bow and an arrow.
      It seems he has come to hunt.
      He asked us, ‘Did you see an elephant?’
      He rides on Garuda and is a thief.
      He asks things he can’t ask at his house.
      Did our relatives tell us to go to the millet field
      to answer naughty questions like this?”

2500. He says,
      “I have done bad karma.
      My mind thinks of the millet field
      where she is and the path to go there.
      O girls watching the millet field,
      are you like goddesses in the sky
      where the lotus-eyed Kaṇṇan stays?
      Tell me, what are your divine qualities?”

2501. Her mother says,
      “Her beautiful fish-eyes shed tears like a river.
      Does she suffer with love sickness?
      She wants the garland of him
      who rides on Garuḍa adorned with a thulasi garland dripping with honey
      and carried Govardhana mountain as an umbrella,
      to protect the cows and the cowherds from the big storm.
      What will become of the heart of my daughter ornamented with lovely bangles?”

2502. She says,
      “My bangles grow loose because I love the lord
      the god of the gods and the god of Indra, the king of the gods.
      His scepter that protects the sky and the earth
      is bent because he does not want to help me.
      I worry about the pain that his thulasi garland
      may give to those who love him like me on this earth”

2503. He says,
      “The sun travels through all lands
      and makes this desert so hot that no one can live here.
      You, precious as gold,
      have crossed into even this hot land with me.
      Let us go to the temple in Thiruvekka
      where the gods in the sky come to worship Kaṇṇan.
      The beautiful, blooming grove near the temple
      will take away our weariness
      and make us feel good in this desert land.”

2504. She says,
      “The world says,
      ‘If someone receives the grace of the ruler, the protector of the world,
      even enemies will become his friend.’ This is true.
      I received the cool thulasi garland of Kaṇṇan and wear it,
      and now even the cold wind that would blow like whistling fire
      in the middle of every night makes me cool.”

2505. She says,
      “In Srirangam where you stay,
      the Kaviri flows with abundant water.
      There birds look to catch crabs
      and the flowing water stops them and saves the crabs.
      We want your cool thulasi garland
      and are distressed that we do not have it.
      The cool wind blows and makes us suffer more
      and no one can escape from worry when their thoughts wander.
      Give us your grace.”

2506. She says,
      “O swans that were born in good families,
      go with your mates to the dark-colored lord
      who shines like lightning and tell him,
      ‘We are her messengers.
      She begged us to tell you how she loves you.’
      Women do not go as messengers.
      Aren’t you the right ones to go for me?”

2507. She says,
      “O swans and bees, I bow to you
      and ask you to take my message to him.
      Tell me, won’t you go to him? I won’t forget your help.
      If you see other women Kaṇṇan loves
      in Vaikuṇḍam tell them also about me.
      Understand that helping me is the right thing for you to do.”

2508. She says,
      “O clouds floating in the sky with shining lightning
      over hills as beautiful as pure gold studded with jewels,
      You are going towards the place where he is
      in the Thiruvenkaṭam hills that are known everywhere.
      If I ask you to be my messengers, will you agree?
      If I ask you to fly over me,
      will you do that and go to see him?”

2509. She says,
      “O clouds, tell me, how did you get the good fortune
      of having the color of the divine Thirumāl?
      Did you do tapas to receive the grace of him who gives life to all?
      Dark and filled with water,
      you give rain to the world and make it flourish.”

2510. Her friend says,
      “You rest on Adishesa on the ocean
      and rule this world with a scepter and your divine discus
      and you take away the bad karma of the world
      and the wide sky and give your grace to all.
      Are you ignoring her, thinking she is just a woman?
      Do you think she is a stranger?
      We cannot understand what you are thinking,
      but we see her growing pale and her beauty being spoiled.”

2511. Her friend says,
      “You are our Thirumāl.
      Upset, she kicks and erases the kuḍal she drew on the sand
      because it will not come together.
      She loves you and wants your thulasi garland.
      I don’t know how to help her and keep her from worrying so.”

2512. She says,
      “The evening, the woman of the west,
      feels alone after the sun, her husband, has left
      as she holds in her lap the moon, her son,
      whose mouth is filled with milk.
      The cool wind blows strong as if it wants to take away
      all the grace that Thirumāl who measured the world
      gives to those who long for his thulasi garland."

2513. Her friend says,
      “The night is getting dark
      and the world looks as if the end of the eon had arrived.
      She always prattles, saying, ‘cool thulasi garland,’
      but our father who destroyed the forts in Lanka
      surrounded with tall palaces
      does not feel sorry for her suffering.
      How could he be so cruel to her?”

2514. Her mother says,
      “Hunters live with arrows that kill animals
      in the forest where my daughter went with him,
      and there are other thieves there who steal cows.
      Young people there beat their loud drums.
      I have done bad karma.
      My soft-waisted daughter, beautiful as a doe,
      has gone away with Kaṇṇan, worshiping his lotus feet.
      How could she walk with him in the terrible forest?”

2515. She says,
      “Did the neelam flowers do long tapas
      as they grew in ponds with their strong stalks?
      Is that why they have the color of him, the dancer on the pot
      who measured the world and the sky at Mahābali’s sacrifice?”

2516. She says,
      “The dark-colored one , the protector
      of good people and of the gods in the sky,
      rules the sky and the world
      surrounded by the ocean rolling with waves.
      The lotuses that bloom in the ponds
      on the dark hills look like the lord
      with a dark body and lotus eyes.”

2517. She says to her friends,
      “O you ornamented with beautiful jewels!
      The sun that is like a beautiful white elephant
      sets in the evening and darkness appears like a herd of elephants.
      When will the day come when my mothers
      bring the thulasi garland of the beloved of the earth goddess
      and put it on me to make me happy?”

2518. She says,
      “The terrible wind does not stop blowing.
      There is so much heat, I don’t know what to do.
      He who rides on Garuda and destroyed the Asuras
      does not give his grace to me.
      People gossip in the mandram in the village
      and the cruel wind burns me.”

2519. She says,
      “He grew to the sky as if to say,
      ‘The distance between the sky and the earth is too small for me.’
      My eyes that worship his feet
      are like the soft lotuses in a pond waving in a strong wind.”

2520. She says,
      “His eyes and hands are like beautiful lotuses
      and he has the color of a dark mountain.
      Even the sages who know everything,
      the gods in the sky and all others
      cannot describe his beautiful color.”

2521. She says,
      “The sages and the scholars of religions
      who try to find the paths of dharma may say,
      ‘This is the color, beauty, name and form of the highest lord,’
      but he is only the light of wisdom
      and no one really knows who he is,
      or what his greatness is.”

2522. She says,
      “He gives his grace to us with his lotus eyes.
      Is there anyone who can help us as he can
      or any friend like him?
      The bond between him and us is forever—
      he is with us and we will have no trouble.
      O heart, do not worry! Worship him and live.
      O ignorant heart, only he can remove our births.”

2523. She says,
      “I thought my mind was my own
      and there was no one closer to me than my own heart.
      I thought my heart would help me
      if I sent it as a messenger to him
      who split open the chest of Hiraṇyan,
      but it went to him and stayed.
      It doesn’t want to come back
      but wanders sweetly with him.”

2524. Her mother says,
      “My daughter fell in love with Kaṇṇan.
      The wind from the north blows always and makes her suffer,
      the moon pours down its rays and makes her hot
      and her conch bangles grow loose.
      She longs for his cool thulasi garland
      and her body grows pale
      because he hasn’t given it to her.
      What will happen to my gentle daughter?”

2525. She says,
      “How can a worm moving so slowly with its soft body ever get to see the world?
      I am just like that worm waiting to see him.
      People have long believed that lizards can tell the future,
      and this lizard tells me
      that the beloved of Lakshmi will come to see me soon.
      I hope that is true.”

2526. She says,
      “O friend with a shining forehead,
      the dark-colored lord who wears thulasi garlands that swarm with bees
      is Madhusudhanan, he is Damodharan.
      I have not seen, heard or known
      a darkness like the color of his body
      that eclipses even the darkness of the night.
      But it is not only his dark body—
      this darkness of the night also makes me suffer.”

2527. He says,
      “O charioteer, drive swiftly. Don’t go slow.
      I must go and see my beloved with shining forehead
      before her pallor increases.
      We should go to the wide Thiruvenkaṭam hills
      of the god of gods in the sky
      where a waterfall shines like the pearl garland.
      and falls to the ground.

2528. She says,
      “He, Māyappirān, churned the milky ocean using Mandara mountain
      for a churning stick and the snake Vasuki for a rope
      and he gave to the gods the nectar that came up.
      The conch bangles I bought from the fishermen are becoming loose.
      Does the ocean want to have them back because they belong to it?”

2529. She says,
      “The rain goddess takes the white waves of the dark ocean
      and goes to him as he rests on a snake bed with Lakshmi.
      The waterfalls make the hills
      look like the breast of earth goddess
      and then as they flow into rivers
      it looks as if she were shedding tears and saying,
      ‘Tirumal is cruel!’”

2530. The fortuneteller says,
      “She fell in love with the god of the gods in the sky
      and is sick with love for him.
      Bring a thulasi garland or a leaf from it
      or a beautiful branch of the plant or its root
      and fan her with it.”

2531. Sending bees as messengers, she says,
      “O bees, it is easy for you to fly to the sky where he is.
      Before you go to see him,
      make sure you remember clearly the message that I give you.
      Go to his faultless lotus feet and tell him.
      The cowherd women scolded him
      because he stole their butter and ate it,
      but I won’t say anything like that.
      Help me reach his faultless feet.”

2532. He says,
      “O bees! Come. You drink honey from the beautiful flowers
      that bloom on the water, on the earth
      and in the trees, and you feel happy and fly about.
      I want to tell you something.
      She is like the Vaikuṇḍam of him who took the form of a boar.
      You drink honey from the fragrant flowers on her hair.
      Have you ever seen such flowers anywhere else?”

2533. She says,
      “O friend! Through the divine grace of him
      who swallowed the whole earth and spit it out
      we have a place to live.
      We are not afraid of anything.
      The cool breeze brings honey
      from his beautiful thulasi garland and sprinkles it
      on my body and my ornaments.
      No one around me knows this.
      I am happy.”

2534. He says,
      “Her face is like a lotus,
      her eyes are like beautiful kendai fish or sharp spears,
      her nose is like a vine
      and she wears earrings in her ears.
      When our eyes met we felt as if we had drunk
      the nectar from the milky ocean churned up by the gods.
      No one will gossip about us—our love is true.”

2535. Her friend says,
      “When he took the boon from Mahābali,
      one foot covered the whole world
      and the other foot had to go to sky
      since there is no space left on the earth.
      He is the highest lord of the world and the sky
      and he is the light of knowledge.
      There is nothing left anywhere
      for the lotus-eyed Kaṇṇan to measure.”

2536. Her foster mother says,
      “She longs for the thulasi garland
      of Madhusudanan, the lord of flourishing world,
      and she, her lovely teeth like jasmine, cannot bear the pain
      of the night that seems as long as an eon.
      My daughter’s round breasts have grown pale.
      I have done bad karma.”

2537. Her mother says,
      “My daughter’s breasts have not grown out yet,
      her hair is not yet thick
      and she doesn’t know how to put her clothes on.
      She only prattles.
      Her bright, mesmerizing glance is precious beyond any price.
      She only knows to say, ‘Is he the highest lord?
      Is Thiruvenkaṭam the hill where he stays?’”

2538. Her friend says,
      “O friend, how can we praise his might?
      He is the highest and most ancient god of the gods in the sky
      and all in the sky worship him.
      He measured the whole earth and the sky with his two feet
      without growing tired,
      yet he came to the cowherd village
      and was born as a baby there.”

2539. Her friend says,
      “You have the color of a cloud
      and you rest on a snake bed on the ocean.
      Even if she worships the ocean and asks it to be calm,
      it just roars out, ‘aṟaiyoo!’
      Her chastity cannot be saved without your divine grace.
      Is this right, O lord?”

2540. She says,
      “He has a wonderful color
      and his cool beautiful eyes shine
      like lotuses blooming in the ponds in the sky.
      I love the divine presence of Kaṇṇan, Thirumāl—
      my heart thinks of him constantly without stopping.”

2541. She says
      “The Vediyars are like the gods in the sky
      as they worship him reciting the mantras of the Vedas.
      I blame myself for my bad karma and try to join him.
      I have learned his divine names and recite them
      but I am like someone who bites into a bitter unripe fruit
      because he cannot get a ripe one.”

2542. He says,
      “Her flower eyes, more beautiful than a doe’s,
      seem to talk to her ears.
      She worships the feet of the god
      who swallowed the whole world and spit it out.
      Her divine eyes swallow me.”

2543. He says,
      “O friend, She is divine like the Vaikuṇṭam
      of our god who is fire, water, wind, sky and earth.
      Her eyes like kāvi flowers are my life.
      Like the yogis who do not eat, sleep or have feelings
      and put their minds only on god,
      my thoughts are only on her.”

2544. He says,
      “She is like a swan with soft wings living in the Thiruvenkaṭam hills
      where Mādhavan Govindan stays who rides on Garuḍa,
      and conquered the Asurans.
      Her eyes are like kāvi flowers, neelam flowers, spears and fish
      and they are mighty enough to take away my life.
      She is like a soft-feathered swan.”

2545. He says,
      “You are like Vaikuṇṭam of the god
      who measured the earth surrounded with oceans.
      Kondrai trees have begun to bloom
      even though the rainy season has not arrived—
      they seem to be inviting the rainy season
      with their branches where long golden flowers hang.”

2546. Her friend says,
      “O you with your young breasts tied with a band,
      don’t worry that even though night has arrived like a dark bull
      he has not come.
      He went to Mahābali’s sacrifice and took over the whole world—
      Won’t he give his grace to you? Don’t worry.
      You will not lose your bangles.”

2547. She says to her friend.
      “I long for the fragrant thulasi garland that is on the head
      of the lord of the sky with a discus—
      it will take away my pallor.
      The darkness of night increases always for me
      whether it is one day, one month,
      one year or a thousand eons and makes me suffer.”

2548. She says,
      “O friend, I have never said
      that he swallowed all the seven worlds at the end of the eon.
      I saw the kaḷām fruit and said only it has the color of the ocean.
      My mother heard and said,
      ‘She says this fruit has his color
      who swallowed all the seven worlds.’
      O friends, my mother thinks that I think of his color.”

2549. She says,
      “The crescent moon that splits the darkness surrounding the world
      increases the pain of my love.
      I am alone and my heart grows weak
      longing for his thulasi garland.
      The pale color of my body increases.
      How can I survive with this bright moon?”

2550. Her friend says,
      “The white moon shines with milk-like rays
      in the sky in the evening.
      She suffers alone and her beloved,
      the lord with the heroic discus,
      the protector of all the seven worlds,
      has not come to give his grace.
      How could he not give his grace to her?”

2551. She says,
      “He knows everything in the world,
      and he rests on his snake bed on the milky ocean
      rolling with waves that come and go.
      He swallowed all the worlds at the end of the eon.
      and he carried Govardhana mountain
      to protect the cows and the cowherds.
      The fresh breeze that blows through his thulasi garland
      comes and blows on me.”

2552. He says,
      “You have a shining face
      and your eyes that are like keṇḍai fish spear through my heart.
      Our lord rests on Adisesha on the ocean where conches roam and the smell of fish spreads.
      Do you live in Vaikuṇṭam
      where he lives, worshiped by the gods in the sky?”

2553. She says,
      “O innocent heart,
      you yearn for the beautiful cool thulasi garland of the lord
      who grew tall and measured the earth and the sky.
      He makes the bright moon rise in the evening
      when lovely lotuses close and soft ambal flowers open.
      It is strange that my love for him
      makes my conch bangles loose.”

2554. She says,
      “Evening has come
      and the sun, the king of the day, sets after ruling the world
      and the crescent moon rises slowly.
      The thulasi garland of the god of the gods in the sky
      who fought with the Raksasas in southern Lanka and destroyed them
      appears before me, makes me pallid and hurts me.”

2555. She says,
      “I cannot describe the strength and ability
      of the dark mountain-like lord who fought Vānāsuran
      and cut off his thousand strong arms.
      My innocent heart went to fetch his beautiful thulasi garland
      and has not returned—
      I am left only with the pain of my love.”

2556. She says,
      “The Vedas praise the lord
      whose chest is adorned with a white thread.
      The gods in the sky praise the endless one
      who swallowed all the worlds at the end of the eon
      and rests on Adisesha on the ocean.
      Devotees of the whole world worship the god Sridharan,
      and they are higher than the gods in the sky for me.”

2557. She says,
      “The sun sets like the kings who ruled the world
      with their scepters for a time and disappeared.
      You measured the world and you are the king of the sky.
      Now, the darkness grows and gives us pain.
      Do not leave us. Give us your grace.”

2558. Her friend says,
      “Don’t her mothers know what is happening to her?
      They don’t know and they call the Velan to find out.
      Didn’t they give birth to her?
      Isn’t there anyone who knows
      how to decorate her hair with a thulasi garland
      and take her to the Thiruvengaṭam hills?
      That is what she needs.
      She is growing weak, suffering from the fire of love.”

2559. She says,
      “His eyes shine like two burning suns
      rising from the tops of the hills
      and they destroy and burn the Asurans.
      Tell me, how is it that they burn us?
      He protects the whole world—
      he should not be hurting us like this.
      Tell us, is this what he does to all the world?”

2560. Her friend says,
      “The male andril living in the cage on the palm tree calls his mate
      and his cooing is like the viḷari raga.
      My friend hears that and her life and body grow weak
      and she continuously speaks his name.
      I don’t know how she will survive.”

2561. She says,
      “You have the color of kohl
      and you shine like a jewel.
      You are a pearl. You are my diamond.
      O dear one, I want to see you
      among the beautiful girls at the festivals
      holding your white conch
      and golden discus in your hands.”

2562. She says,
      “The evening has arrived and the pure golden sun sets
      like a diamond that a monkey has thrown down on the hill.
      You are a diamond and you measured the world.
      You are my emerald,
      my matchless precious gold, my refuge.
      I am apart from you in this evening.”

2563. She says,
      “The lord with a discus and a conch
      helped Shiva when Brahma’s skull
      was stuck to his hands and made it fall off.
      When he stole butter Yashoda tied him
      with rough ropes and beat him.
      What can I say?
      I can only prattle on praising my dear lord.”

2564. Her friend says,
      “The voice of the andril bird calling his mate
      and the sound of the ocean flowing
      with roaring waves in the backwaters
      increase her lovesickness.
      O Thirumāl, all these sounds make her suffer.
      The world sees her suffering in love and gossips about her.
      Is this how you play?”

2565. She says,
      “Meru mountain has a form like Thirumāl
      and the bright sun is like the divine discus in his beautiful hands.
      I have not seen his form or his discus,
      but I prattle on as if I had seen him.
      He has given his grace to me, his devotee,
      and I will not experience the results of my bad karma.”

2566. She says,
      “When will I reach the lord, the beloved of Lakshmi,
      nectar for those who have done good karma
      and the destroyer of their bad karma?
      Even though he only grazed the cows,
      he is strong as a bull,
      and he measured the world and the sky
      with his two feet in ancient times.”

2567. She says,
      “I was born to worship you
      whose discus destroyed the clan of Asuras.
      I can only serve you with this body,
      but I cannot reach your feet in this illusory birth.
      I have been on this earth a long time,
      O father, but I cannot reach you.”

2568. She says,
      “Like a thief the mischievous lord
      stole butter from uṟi that was tied high on the wall,
      swallowed all the earth in his stomach,
      and went to Mahābali’s sacrifice as a dwarf
      and asked for three feet of land.
      I am his slave.
      My heart doesn’t want to love anyone but him.”

2569. She says,
      “The gods in the sky
      worshiped your feet in the morning and evening.
      and asked you to burn Lanka, the land of the evil Raksasas.
      Did they worship you just to see you as Rama,
      one of your many forms?”

2570. She says,
      “In the morning when the hot sun arrives
      the wicked darkness runs away
      and then comes back to spread in the evening.
      The wise sages who worship the lord
      closing their eyes and meditating
      do not need to recite his praise or think of his dark form.”

2571. His friend says,
      “Only Vediyars are fit to worship your dark body,
      with beautiful lotus eyes and divine feet.
      The cows that return home in the evening
      will call when they come near their stall
      and the blind cow will call and follow their calling.
      Just like them I, your slave, praise you with words.
      I have not seen you. What else can I do?”

2572. She says,
      “The soul comes to this earth, enters a body, lives
      and when the body grows old, it suffers and leaves this world.
      I don’t want to be born—I want to be always with him.
      I want to find some tapas that will take me to moksha
      and remove the results of my karma.
      He is my mother and father and can give me moksha—
      I worship him to reach him.”

2573. She says,
      “You created many yugas, many gods and many religions,
      and wise people worship the gods of those religions
      and follow their teachings.
      There is no other god like you.
      If my mother calls the Velan and asks him about me,
      I will not perform the rituals he asks me to do.
      My love for you is the only true thing
      and I will worship only you.”

2574. She says,
      “I have fallen in love with the lord
      surrounded by many gods happily worshiping him
      and for many days haven’t slept
      as I have seen the sun rise and set.
      Many eons have passed like this.
      How could those who fall in love with Thirumāl
      close their eyes and sleep?”

2575. Her friend says,
      “All the gods in the sky
      and the sages and others who do not sleep
      worship our matchless, omnipotent god.
      He will remove their future births.
      How can anyone understand how one so divine
      could steal butter and eat it? Is it his magic?”

2576. She says,
      “People know that I am in love with him
      who became a boar and brought the earth goddess
      from the underworld at the end of the eon.
      Let them gossip about me with mean words—
      it doesn’t matter to me.
      For Indra of the karpaga garden and the other gods
      there is no other wise god like him.
      I have not known any good thing but him.”

2577. The poet says,
      “Māran from Thirukkuruhur where good people live
      composed a garland of a hundred pasurams
      on the divine name of Thirumāl.
      If devotees learn and recite these pasurams
      they will not have the results of their bad karma
      and will not be born in the mire that is this false earth.

Thiruvirutham mutrum. Nammaazhvar Thiruvaḍikaḷee saraṇam

--------------
## 18. Nammaazhvar - Thiruvāsiriyam (2578 -2584)
    Praising the god

2578. O lord, with red garments,
      your crown is the sun that spreads bright rays
      and the beautiful moon floats above your head.
      Your mouth is as lovely as coral
      and you shine like a light and an emerald hill.
      You are adorned with golden clothes
      and many precious ornaments
      and your mouth and eyes shine,
      adding to the luster of your dark body.
      You rest on thousand-headed Adisesha
      in the middle of ocean with rolling waves
      as Shiva, Nānmuhan who stays on a lotus on your navel, Indra
      and all the crowd of gods worship you.
      O lord, you measured all the three worlds
      with your divine feet.

2579. You, our father, created the world and swallowed it.
      My heart longs to worship your shining lotus feet
      ornamented with sounding anklets, melting to receive you.
      My love for you flows like sweet nectar.
      Some people wish only for material things,
      never thinking of being your devotee—
      let them do whatever they want.
      The nature of this illusionary world is to become rich.
      Even if someone gets everything he needs in this world
      and excellent moksha, the wise will not want a worldly life.
      Their only aim will be to reach your feet.

2580. He, the first one of the three gods,
      with shining jewels on his chest, rules all the three worlds,
      leading them on a good path.
      He churned the milky ocean using Mandara mountain
      for a churning stick and the snake Vasuki for a rope,
      and as the ocean was churned,
      it roared with a a loud noise like thunder as its waves rolled.
      May we serve the devotees of the matchless god
      continuously, eon after eon.

2581. Will he accept us as his devotees in all the eons
      so that we may worship him?
      At the time of terrible flood
      when there was no world and no people, X
      he, the seed from which everything came,
      the only god at the end of the eon,
      created Nānmuhan from his navel on a lotus,
      and Nānmuhan created three-eyed Shiva
      and the other gods and all the three worlds.
      Let us worship the feet of Māyan.

2582. Your eyes are like lotuses blooming in a forest,
      your mouth is as sweet as a fruit,
      your feet are like a thousand suns shining together
      and your thousand divine arms
      are like many flourishing forests of the karpaga garden.
      When you put one foot on the earth and measured the whole world
      and raised your other shining lotus foot to the sky and measured it,
      the world created by Nānmuhan was amazed and pleased
      and the gods in the sky performed their worship.
      O Thirumāl! Can anyone measure the world
      with their feet like this except you ?

2583. Is this the nature of this world?
      Some ignorant people worship small gods
      and it is if they were worshiping a wooden plank
      when they have a mother who gave birth to them.
      When they have their own ancient first god
      who created, split open, and measured the earth,
      giving them his grace,
      they do not worship him but they worship small gods
      thinking that they are the real gods.
      They offer them meat and then eat it
      and do many wrong things,
      worshiping in a way that will give them only sorrow.
      As they enjoy their lives,
      they are involved in the illusions of this world,
      only to be born again and suffer again in life.

2584. Shiva with the crescent moon in his matted hair,
      Nānmuhan, Indra, the gods in the sky
      and all the creatures of the world worship him.
      At the end of the eon he swallowed the earth, ocean, fire, wind, sun,
      moon, the sky and all other flourishing
      and shining things in the world
      and kept them in his stomach
      as he, the divine Māyan, rested on a banyan leaf.
      Is there any other god who is more divine for us to worship?

## 19. Nammāzhvar’s Periya Thiruvanthādi. (2585 – 2671)
2585. O heart!
      If you want to see him, get ready and come.
      Let us go together
      and praise with good words the divine nature and fame
      of the god colored like a kāyām flower.

2586. Sometimes we praise you
      sometimes we blame you,
      sometimes we do not praise you
      and sometimes we do not blame you.
      Sometimes we disrespect you.
      sometimes we do not disrespect you,
      O lovely-eyed Thirumāl, don't get angry at us
      even though we have done bad karma.
      Our lord, give us your grace.

2587. Even though I know
      which deeds are good and which are bad,
      I do not have the power to control myself
      to avoid good or bad deeds.
      O lord, what can I do?

2588. My heart has become a slave
      to the dark shining ocean-colored Kaṇṇan.
      If I think about it, I am most fortunate
      and I have a good name.
      Who could there be more fortunate than I?

2589. You are my mother who gave birth to me
      the father who taught me.
      Whatever others taught me, it is of no use.
      O dear Māyan who drank Putanā’s milk and killed her
      when she came as a mother, show us a good way.

2590. Will you show me the right path and guide me?
      Will you show your tender dark body
      to me, your innocent devotee?
      Dear Kaṇṇan, tell me what you want to do with me.
      Whatever you do to me, I will think it is for my good.

2591. I have done bad karma and am far away from you.
      My heart came to you to worship your feet.
      You embrace Lakshmi, your beloved wife, on your chest.
      You took the form of a boar
      and brought the earth goddess from the underworld.
      You are my beloved mother.
      Keep me beneath your feet.

2592. O good lord! We have not seen your feet
      that measured the world
      and we yearn to see you–tell us, why can we not see you?
      You are subtle, impossible for sinners like us to see,
      a match only for yourself.

2593. We said to him again and again,
      “We, your slaves, are suffering,”
      but we still can’t approach him.
      O heart, let whatever will happen happen.
      Just live, thinking only of him.

2594. Only the eight Vasus, eleven Rudras,
      twelve suns and two Ashvins
      may worship him.
      We are not worthy to worship him.
      O good heart, we have done much bad karma.

2595. You are the earth, the sky, the wind,
      fire and the ocean.
      You, mighty one, fought heroically with Rāvaṇa
      when he opposed you and you killed him.

2596. O heart, you immerse me in an ocean of sorrow,
      and if I say you shouldn’t, what is the use?
      Whatever I tell you, you don’t listen.
      The only right thing is to worship the feet of Kaṇṇan.

2597. What I am going to ask you is not strange.
      O lord, if some devotee of yours asks you for something
      that you may not want to give,
      you will not lose anything by giving that to him.
      This is what I want to ask you.
      Show me your form.
      However you wish, show me your shining body.

2598. O heart, the devil Putanā
      did not know the power of the dark god,
      and gave her milk to him, but he killed her.
      You know that if you fall into the enjoyments
      of your senses they will hurt you,
      but still you want to enjoy them and collect bad karma.
      It is as if you were putting your hand into a snake pit.

2599. O heart, know this.
      The waves of the ocean roar
      and strike his body and feet
      as he rests on Adisesha.
      If we praise his auspicious qualities,
      it won’t give him any fame,
      but our bad karma will all go away.

2600. You, the good lord came as a dwarf
      who was never born or raised on the earth
      and asked for three feet of land,
      measured it with one foot and took it.
      You swallowed the earth at the end of the eon and spat it out
      and you brought the earth goddess from the underworld.
      The whole earth is yours,
      so why did you ask for the earth from Mahābali as a gift?
      Please tell us.

2601. He carried his bow, fought with the Rakshasa Rāvaṇa
      and cut off his strong mountain-like heads with his sword.
      When devotees worship him and ask him for a boon,
      whether he opens his mouth and says anything or not,
      he gives them whatever they want and gives them life.

2602. You are clever.
      Whether you are tied up with ropes by Yashoda
      or you rest on the snake bed,
      you create all the creatures of the world always.
      Who knows your true ancient form? Tell me.

2603. O heart, you do not know any wickedness
      and if you praise him, who protected the five Pandavas
      night and day on the battlefield as they fought with the Kauravas
      nothing bad will come to you.
      If you want to see him, you can.

2604. O intelligent good heart,
      As a dwarf, he went to Mahābali’s sacrifice and measured the world,
      and his body touched all the world.
      We should be ashamed to think we can earn his grace.
      The only way for us to get his grace is if he gives to us.

2605. His body dark as a cloud,
      he measured the world and the ocean with one foot
      and raised his other foot and measured the sky.
      His feet are in my heart
      and I will not go to hell but be saved.

2606. When Thirumāl entered my heart
      the karma left that ruled me and made me suffer.
      My bad karma shouts with sorrow as it runs away,
      unable to find a place to stay.

2607. O heart, he is the father and mother of all creatures
      and will give us his grace and protect us when we are feeble
      and the messengers of Yama come
      bringing their dogs and make them bark at us.
      O heart, do not worry, do not worry.

2608. He is unique and there is no one equal to him.
      He is in everything.
      If he were to grow tired,
      the whole world would turn upside down,
      and then who could make this world
      come back to the way it was?

2609. People may do whatever they wish.
      Who can change this wide earth?
      Kaṇṇan, the god of the gods in the sky
      gave his grace to me
      and all the sorrows in my heart went away.

2610. His beautiful body is like dark night.
      His grace is like a club
      that can hit and remove my bad karma.
      I and my heart decided to cross the forest
      and the hills of my bad karma by worshiping him.

2611. Are you, tall Thirumāl,
      happy because you measured the earth with your foot?
      Are you happy because you measured the sky with your foot?
      The whole world knows that you raised your ankleted feet
      and measured the earth and the sky.
      Am I someone who does not know your power?

2612. Our eyes cannot see the dark form of the lord with a discus,
      we can only feel him in our hearts, our inner eyes.
      We should not feel that we are not seeing him
      because he is in our hearts and that is where we can see him.

2613. Our father adorned with a flourishing thulasi garland
      is not easy to approach.
      He shows as much as love to his devotees as they show to him.
      I love him—my dear lord is easy for me to reach.

2614. Lovely-eyed Thirumāl entered my small heart,
      and from now on bad karma cannot stay there
      because there is no space for it.
      It is best if it leaves my heart and never comes back.

2615. He put a pot on his head, danced
      and then went to the wide ocean and rested on Adishesa.
      We have found the way to remove our karma
      and it is to know his grace and beauty,
      approaching him and bowing to his feet
      and staying in his shadow.

2616. Damodharan wishes me to serve him,
      but my heart would rather do evil deeds
      and live a wicked life.
      What can I do in this world to take away my karma?

2617. The lord with a discus in his hand
      smashed the deadly Asurans to pieces.
      When we know him, we know it brings joy,
      but then why we are not approaching him,
      doing the good karma that leads us to him?

2618. You, the ancient lord of justice,
      shine with the dark color of the ocean.
      I worship you and all my karma is destroyed.
      When I hear of the beauty of you
      as you rest on Adisesha on the ocean,
      my legs become unsteady,
      my heart suffers to see you,
      and my eyes look for you everywhere.

2619. He stands in Thiruvuuragam,
      he sits in Thiruppāḍagam
      and reclines in Thiruvekkaa.
      He wanders everywhere, yet still, he is not satisfied.
      The god who split open the chest of the Asuran Hiraṇyan
      and loves all the creatures of the world
      entered my heart and stays there, refusing to leave.

2620. Do not wonder to yourself,
      “Is he far away?
      Is he near?
      Is he in between?
      Is he the god in the sky?”
      If you accept Kaṇṇan
      and give yourself to him
      whoever you think god is
      he will be the god for you.

2621. O good heart,
      We do not know what our future will be,
      yet we may be able to know it
      if we worship Thirumāl adorned with a thulasi garland
      that swarms with bees.
      Love and worship him and you will be saved.

2622. O heart, do not worry about how to spend your time.
      Think about the time Yashoda hit him and scolded him,
      and even if you cannot do that,
      speak about Māyan adorned with a thulasi garland.
      Your karma will go away and you will be saved.

2623. O heart, if you want to survive
      you should do good deeds.
      It is not enough only to praise him
      with a fresh thulasi garland on his chest.

2624. O heart!
      There is no other opportunity for us like this one
      to praise his power and fame.
      You will not be pushed into cruel hell
      if you worship him
      who drank the milk of the devil Putana and killed her
      when she came as a mother.
      Praising him will give you true strength.

2625. The wrestlers sent by Kamsan
      thought they were stronger than you and opposed you,
      but you cut off their heads with the discus in your hand
      and killed them.
      Do not stop doing your heroic deeds.
      There are always Asurans like them in the world.

2626. People say
      “He swallowed all the worlds
      at the end of the eon and spat them out,
      he split open the world and went to the underworld
      to bring up the earth goddess,
      and he measured the world at Mahābali’s sacrifice with his foot.
      He is the creator of the world and he is himself the world.”
      If devotees know this, they will not worship any other god.

2627. When the gods came to him asking for refuge
      he took away their troubles and protected them.
      How can the distress in the minds
      of those who do not worship him be removed?

2628. There are people who do not wish to praise him
      who is adorned with a thulasi garland
      even though their good hearts
      and their tongues would like to.
      Is that because they have done bad karma in a past life?

2629. Afraid of the results bad karma will give me,
      I will not do any bad deeds.
      I will only praise the god of the gods
      and bow to his golden feet.

2630. The ocean-colored Thirumāl with beautiful eyes
      is our refuge and will not leave us.
      He protects us so we will not fall into cruel hell.
      O heart, think always of him who is your only refuge—
      this is the the best advice I can give you.

2631. O Thirumāl, do not think that all people worship you
      only to ask for material things.
      You do not understand that wise ones ask only for your grace.
      Where are those wise people
      who think of you and receive your grace?
      How many are there? Could I achieve what they have done?

2632. We want to reach moksha,
      above the world of the sky
      and the only way we can achieve it is to worship you
      who fought and killed the seven bulls with cruel horns
      to marry Nappinnai with beautiful soft arms like bamboo,

2633. Whenever I see clouds, a dark mountain,
      the dark ocean, deep darkness,
      puvai flowers always swarming with bees
      or anything else that is dark-colored,
      my heart, thinking it has seen his wonderful dark form,
      leaves me and runs there.

2634. My heart leaves me searching for where he is
      without looking for anything else
      and it runs behind anything with a dark color.
      In his heart he does not feel sorry for me.
      Does he who split open the mouth of the Asuran Kesi
      when he came as a horse that have such a cruel mind?

2635. The wicked five senses
      control the mind, eyes, nose, mouth, ears and body.
      The best thing for the devotees of the lord
      adorned with a cool thulasi garland
      is to control the feelings of the five senses
      and worship the lord’s feet.

2636. He took the form of a bachelor dwarf,
      went to Mahābali, asked for three feet of land
      and measured the earth and the sky.
      He drank milk from the breasts of the devious Putana and killed her.
      My eyes have only the desire to see him
      and my mouth does not wish to praise anything but his fame.

2637. O lovely-eyed Thirumāl,
      I would tell you something.
      You have given everything that your devotees want
      and are waiting to know what else they may want.
      Don’t you know that praising you
      and keeping you in their hearts
      is better for them than going to Vaikuṇṭam?

2638. We worshiped him
      who threw a calf at the vilam tree
      and killed the two Asurans
      when they came as a calf and a tree
      and all the results of our karma went away,
      we don’t know where.
      Did they go to the sky,
      or to the ocean whose rolling waves are blown by the wind?
      Did they burn up in fire or go to the forest?

2639. He rests on the ocean rolling with waves
      on Adisesha who has a jewel on his head.
      It is hard if you think he will come to you
      but if you think of him always in your heart
      he will enter it and take away the troubles in your mind.

2640. There are no troubles in the lives of his devotees
      after he has entered their hearts.
      He came to the world in many forms,
      as a cowherd, as a god in the sky
      and as a dwarf who measured the sky and the earth
      at Mahābali’s sacrifice.
      He, the Māyavan, shows the way to all.

2641. O heart, Thirumāl split open the heart of Hiraṇyan
      and blood flowed like a flood from the Asuran’s chest
      and he was destroyed.
      Won’t he take away the results of our karma
      and give us his grace?

2642. O Thirumāl with a shining form,
      I am plunged into your auspicious nature
      that is as pure and sweet as milk.
      Don’t change my life.
      I don’t want to be born again
      but come to you, stay beneath your divine feet
      and serve you.
      All I want is not to forget you.

2643. As soon as I recited the names of the generous lord
      who rests on the ocean with rolling waves
      I thought my karma would go away
      and hide in a forest.
      Nothing like that happened.
      Does my karma think it can still remain with me?

2644. O my heart,
      whether you think always of Māyan
      adorned with a divine thulasi garland
      and stay with him or not, it is up to you,
      but there is no other god who can protect you
      and save you from falling into cruel hell.

2645. When we see the shining stars in the sky,
      they look like flowers filled with pollen
      strewn by the gods in the sky
      as they recited the Vedas
      and worshiped his divine feet
      when he measured the world at the sacrifice of Mahābali.

2646. The faultless sky is an umbrella that protects the earth,
      the stars are like its shining decorations,
      and the moon is its silver base.
      When he grew tall and measured the world
      he looked like a pole holding up the umbrella that is the sky.
      He is the best remedy for all our troubles.

2647. The highest lord with a divine discus in his hand,
      cut off the nose and the ears
      of the evil Raksasi Surpanaha in the forest
      and then went to the ocean
      rolling with strong waves to rest on Adisesha.
      He looked like a dark cloud filled with water
      blown by the wind as it floats in the sky
      and then falls to the ocean.

2648. He shot arrows and destroyed the seven marā trees
      and he split open the mouth of Bāhasuran when he came as a bird.
      If the gods in the sky know
      that he is the highest god and know his heroic deeds,
      won’t they fold their hands and worship him?

2649. O heart, he will remove all the troubles that make you suffer.
      Worship always with a garland of pasurams
      Kesavan, Nāraṇan, Mādhavan
      who wears a beautiful thulasi garland
      and is strong as a mountain.

2650. O heart, he is adorned with a cool fragrant thulasi garland
      and he is the Vedas.
      Know and worship Thirumāl, the Māyavan
      who carries a heroic discus and took the precious life
      of Rāvaṇa, the mighty Rakshasa.

2651. O ignorant heart,
      if you think you do not want to stay in this world
      and want to go to the world of the gods,
      he will give you that boon,
      and if you say, “I want to stay in this world and rule it,”
      he will give that also.
      Learn only to worship and praise the feet of Kaṇṇan
      and you will get what you want.

2652. Does he wish to stay in the Thiruvenkaṭam hills,
      on the roaring ocean, in Vaikuṇṭam, or the world in the sky?
      Or does he feel they are not fitting places for him?
      O what is this strange thing!
      Tall and dark, he entered the heart of me, his slave,
      and does not want to leave it.

2653. I praised the highest ocean-colored Thirumāl
      and he gave me his grace and entered my heart.
      The bad karma that was in my heart grew angry
      and, red-faced and frustrated, left me.
      No one can come and trouble me anymore.

2654. He wears a precious golden crown,
      carries a shining discus in his hand
      and has a thousand divine names.
      He is my father and mother
      and I keep him in my heart—
      he will remove all my troubles.
      Whatever happens to me, I am not worried
      because he will save me.

2655. How can I describe your power?
      Shiva with beautiful jaṭa
      stays in the left part of your body
      and Brahma stays on a lotus on your navel,
      and there is no one to match you
      who do not depend on anything.

2656. Some say that you have three divine forms
      and some say all three are one.
      You have a matchless dark color,
      you are the first god of this world
      and you embrace Lakshmi on a shining lotus
      on your chest.

2657. Whenever I see
      something with the color of the lord,
      a puvai bird, a kayām flower,
      a neelam flower or a kāvi blossom,
      my soft heart thinks that they are his forms
      and my heart and body feel happy.

2658. O heart, he, the cowherd,
      carried Govardhana mountain as an umbrella
      and protected the cows and the cowherds.
      Even though I have pleaded with him continuously
      telling him every day that I long to see him,
      he does not take pity on me and appear before me.
      Is my heart a big mound
      keeping the flood of his grace from flowing over it?

2659. You have swallowed the earth and the wide sky
      and kept them in your stomach.
      Through my ears,
      you entered my heart and remain there.
      You are inside me.
      Who is better, you or me?
      You carry a discus, smeared with flesh.
      Think about it.

2660. You have measured the world.
      When I think of you my heart throbs.
      If your grace touches my body,
      I will be happy and feel
      as if I have measured the world and the sky as you did.
      Tell me, what will happen to me?

2661. O father resting on the roaring ocean,
      my relatives say they are very close to me,
      but see, there is no one for me but you.
      You are my only help in life
      and the companion for whom I am thankful.

2662. O good heart, you feel happy
      that you have a large family,
      an ancient lineage and other friends,
      but none are permanent.
      Praise the heroism of the lord
      who shot arrows from his bow unceasingly
      and conquered all his enemies.
      That is how you will have strength.

2663. Even those of low birth,
      whose occupations are despised,
      if they become the devotees of the god
      with a discus in his beautiful hand
      have no need to worry
      about the results of their karma.
      This world in which they were born
      will be like the shining world of the gods for them—
      there is no need for them to go to heaven.

2664. Even if I have no births, no old age and sickness,
      even if I am happy on this earth,
      I will not want any of those things.
      I think the days that I have not praiseed and worshiped him
      who measured the world at Mahbali’s sacrifice
      are all days of sorrow.

2665. Whenever troubles come to me
      he will take care of me whether it is night or day.
      He does not think that I am bad
      and do not perform good deeds,
      that I am not fit to be his slave
      or that I have no one to take care of me.
      He rests on the flourishing ocean
      giving his grace to me and taking care of me.

2666. I have done bad karma and not knowing him
      I have passed all my days in vain.
      I did not follow and praise him
      who carries a discus in his beautiful hand.

2667. O heart, you do not want to do good things
      and you are tired of the results of your karma.
      See, I told you this. Find a way to save yourself.
      I am worried about myself
      He fought with the wrestlers and killed them.
      The way you will be saved is to worship him.

2668. O my heart,
      I told you to bow your head, to strew flowers at his feet
      folding your hands, worshiping him and praising him,
      but you have not done that.
      You have not asked him,
      “Where did you go?”
      Do not be like this without worshiping him.
      Just worship him. That’s all you need to do.

2669. The dark clouds take water from the ocean
      and float in the sky.
      Where did they go and what tapas they perform
      to have the lovely dark color of the lord
      resting on Adisesha on the milky ocean rolling with waves?

2670. The lord with a body dark as a cloud
      with a discus in his hand
      swallowed the worlds and kept them in his stomach.
      If people do not think of him or praise him
      how can the the results of their karma be removed?

2671. O my heart, whether it is now or another time,
      if you always praise him who carries a discus
      he will remove our karma.
      Always praise his ankleted feet.

## 20. Thirumangai Azhvar - Thiruvezukuṛṛirukkai (2672)
    This is only one Pasuram.

2672. You created Brahma on a large lotus on your navel,
      and you shot your fiery arrows and conquered and burned Lanka
      surrounded with strong forts
      around which even the sun and moon cannot move.
      
      You took the form of a dwarf,
      a Brahmin bachelor dressed in deerskin,
      wore a shining string on your chest
      and went to Mahābali’s sacrifice.
      You asked the king for three feet of land
      and measured all the three worlds and the sky
      with your two feet.
      
      Gajendra the elephant was caught by a crocodile
      and you rode on Garuḍa with beautiful wings,
      went to the deep pond with abundant water,
      making all the directions shake,
      and killed the crocodile
      and saved the long-trunked Gajendra who dripped with ichor.
      
      You are worshipped by Vediyars
      who do five sacrifices with three fires,
      recite the four Vedas and do six deeds.
      Your good devotees controlling their five senses
      and removing desires, pride and egoism from their minds,
      are rid of the good and bad karma that cause future births,
      as they put their minds only on you.
      You know the nature of those
      who do not want to be born again.
      
      You keep in your body the three-eyed Shiva
      who has four arms, is adorned with a snake,
      and has the Ganges flowing in his matted hair.
      He knows your power and worships you
      who swallowed all the seven worlds
      and kept them in your stomach.
      
        You are the six tastes-- sweet, bitter, sour, salty, astringent, pungent.
        You carry six shining weapons in your hands,
        have four arms and are colored like the dark ocean.
        You rest on Adisesha on the ocean.
        The Earth goddess and Lakshmi
        who have beautiful moon-like faces
        stay near your feet at all times of the day and caress them.
        
        You are the four Varṇas,
        and the five elements–sky, fire, ocean, wind, and earth.
        You fought and conquered the seven bulls
        to marry Nappinnai whose hair swarms with six-legged bees
        and lovely-haired Lakshmi stays on your chest.
        All the six religions do not know who you are.
        
        You are the four things–dharma, wealth, pleasure and moksha,
        and the three gods Shiva, Brahma and Vishnu,
        and you, the giver of the results of good and bad karma,
        are the unique god of rich Thirukkuḍandai in the south
        surrounded by flourishing vines
        and groves where flowers always bloom dripping with honey.
        The Kaviri river flows there with its abundant water,
        bringing precious jewels and leaving them on its banks,
        and good paddy flourishes there in beautiful fields.
        You are the god of Thirukkuḍandai
        where the flags on the golden places
        fly in the sky and touch the young crescent moon
        and Vediyars worship you reciting mantras.
        O highest lord, you rest on Adisesha,
        the snake bed on the ocean
        and you know all things. I bow to your feet.
        Remove the results of my karma and my troubles.

## 21. Siriya thirumaḍal - Thirumangaiyāzhvār (2673 to 2712)

Numbers of the Pasurams in this section follows Venkataraghavan’s text and is divided into 40 Pasurams.

The earth goddess

1. This world says,
   “Hills covered with clouds are the breasts of the earth goddess,
   the wide oceans are her clothes
   the bright sun is her thilagam,
   wide rivers are the ornaments on her ample chest,
   large dark clouds are her hair,
   and the ocean is her boundary.
   She is three things, dharma, wealth and moksha.”

2. Many get dharma and wealth
   but they are not permanent.
   People say there is a third thing
   that is higher than those two,
   but they speak in ignorance—I will explain why.

3. The sun god rides on a chariot
   yoked to seven horses and goes around the world–
   does he only go to the world of the gods and stay there?
   That would be like someone wanting to eat meat
   who leaves a rabbit and goes after a crow.

4. She says,
   “O friend with beautiful young breasts,
   listen to what happened to me.
   I adorned my dark hair and tied it up,
   put a band around my beautiful breasts
   a mekalai around my waist,
   and put kohl on my sharp spear-like eyes.
   I was playing ball happily.

5. “Thirumāl with eyes like beautiful lotuses
   blooming in the water came there
   carrying a lovely pot
   and danced on the rich streets as drums played.
   People saw him and felt happy.

6. “My friends, my brothers and others came to me and told me,
   ‘Come, let us go and see him,’
   and I went with them. It was my fate.
   Suddenly my body grew pale
   and the bangles on my hands became loose
   and fell and I couldn’t find them.
   Whatever others said to me,
   I didn’t listen to them.

7. “I was confused,
   and became weak and pale.
   My loving mother
   with a voice as sweet as a parrot’s,
   seeing me suffering, was concerned
   and put vibhuti on my forehead to protect me.

8. “She worshipped the god and asked for a boon,
   saying, ‘I will give you a lovely fragrant garland
   strung with Kuṛinji flowers.
   Please take away my daughter’s sorrow.’

9. “But whatever my mother did,
   it didn’t remove the sorrow from my mind
   or the pain of my love.
   Some older mothers who saw how I suffered
   how my body grew pale advised her,
   ‘Take her to a fortune teller
   who can tell you how to remove her sickness.
   She may tell you the truth.’

10, 11, 12. “When my mother summoned her,
the fortune teller with dark, tied-up hair
worshipped the god and was possessed.
She threw the paddy that my mother gave her
on a winnowing fan, sweated and trembled and said,
‘The thousand-named god has caused her sickness.
He has a dark cloud-colored body,
carries a valampuri conch in his hand
and is adorned with fragrant thulasi garlands.
O you with sharp spear-like eyes, do not worry.
I know who gave this sickness to your daughter
and I will tell you who he is.
He measured this earth with his feet,
shattered Lanka into pieces,
and protected the cows and the cowherds
from the storm with Govardhana mountain.

13, 14, 15. “‘He churned the milky ocean to get nectar for the gods,
he grazed the cows,
and he swallowed all the worlds, kept them in his stomach
and spat them out. But that was not enough for him.
One day in cowherd village
lovely-waisted Yashoda, with beautiful feet,
amred coral mouth and round breasts tied with a band
spent a long time churning good yogurt with a churning stick.
Sweating as her beautiful waist hurt,
she took the butter and carefully put it in a pot
on the uṛi hanging on a rope.
He pretended as if he were sleeping
until Yashoda with a shining forehead had left.
Then he raised up his long arms as high as possible
took gobs of butter and swallowed it.

14. “‘He rolled the pots on the floor
    and again pretended to be sleeping.
    When Yashoda came back she saw him
    acting as if he didn’t know anything,
    and she saw the pots rolling on the ground
    but could not see any of the butter.

15. “‘She hit herself on her stomach and said,
    “Who could have done this except this naughty one?”
    She asked Kaṇṇan, “Did you do this?”
    She got very angry, shouted at him,
    took a long rope, tied him to the mortar
    and spanked him as the villagers looked on.
    He didn’t stop her.

16. “‘Do you know who he is?
    He is the lord who jumped into the deep pond,
    stirred up its abundant water and fought
    the cruel thousand-headed snake Kaalingan.

17. “‘With his sharp sword he cut off
    the nose and ears of Raksasi Surpanaha
    who told Rama that she was as beautiful as Sita.
    He fought with Karan, the brother of Surpanaha
    with his bow and made him suffer as if he were in hell.

18, 19, 20. “‘When handsome broad-armed Rāvaṇa
took Sita whose lovely breasts were tied with a band to Lanka,
Rama went there, fought with Rāvaṇa,
drew his bow and cut off his ten heads.
As a man-lion he split open with his sharp claws
the chest of of Hiranyan, the long-speared fighter,
and wore his intestines on his chest as a garland,
striking his red kumkumam-smeared arms with his hands,
standing and shouting,
while Hiraṇyan lay in a flood of red blood.

21. “‘When he took the form of a dwarf
    and went to the king Mahābali,
    asking for three feet of land,
    that king assented, pouring water on the dwarf’s hands.
    Then, tricking him, the god took a tall form
    and measured the world and the sky with his two feet.

22. “‘He churned the milky ocean with the gods
    and the Asuras using Mandara mountain for a churning stick
    and the snake Vasuki for a rope.

23. “‘The elephant Gajendra, large as a dark mountain,
    who would go to a pond every day to get a lotus flower
    to worship the god,
    was caught by a crocodile one day.
    He raised his long trunk screamed out calling the god,
    “Nārāyaṇā, you with the color of a diamond who rest on Adisesha,
    come, remove my terrible distress.”

24. “‘Our lord came to Gajendra
    and, enraged at the crocodile,
    cut it in two pieces with his discus and saved Gajendra.
    It is the thousand-named lord
    who has given this love sickness to your daughter,
    making her crazy about him.’

25. The fortune teller told all these things to her mother
    and she was pleased because her daughter had not been hurt.
    She understood that she had fallen in love with the lord
    adorned with a fresh thulasi garland
    and realized that her daughter was crying
    with tears falling from her beautiful spear-like eyes
    because she had become his slave
    and was not in love with anyone else.

26, 28. The daughter says,
“I prattle on because I saw his dark cloud-like body.
I wander not knowing what to do
when the cool wind blows giving me pain.
The curly-haired women are gossiping about me,
but I can’t stop them and keep quiet.

29. “I told my heart,
    ‘O heart, go to the sapphire-colored god
    and ask him if he will give me his thulasi garland.
    Speak to him when my enemies are not there—
    otherwise they will give me trouble.
    If he doesn’t answer you, just come back.”
    But when I said that, my heart that went to him
    who has the dark color of the ocean
    did not come back and forgot me.

30.- 33. “I have done bad karma. The villagers are making fun of me
and there is no one to help me.
My life melts like a candle near a fire.
My long eyes don’t sleep even if the whole village sleeps
and I prattle on saying the thousand names of the good lord.
When people fall in love it is like plunging into a dark ocean—
they don’t know the trouble it will bring. Let that be.”

The daughter says,
34. “Let me tell you about a woman whose love is known to eveyone.
    Her name is Vāsavadathathai.
    Once she left all her friends and went along the wide street
    behind her broad-armed garlanded beloved.
    The villagers gossiped saying mean things about her.
    Here is what I am going to do.

35 - 40. “I have decided to go to temples to see the dark one.
I will go to beautiful Thiruvenkaṭam, Thirukkovalur,
strong-walled Kachi, Thiruvuragam, Thirupperagam,
Veḷḷaṛai, temple of the god
who walked through the large marudam trees
and destroyed the Asurans,
Thiruvekka, Thiruvaali, Thiruthangaal,
Thirunaṛaiyur surrounded with water, Thiruppuliyur,
Srirangam surrounded with groves,
Thirukkaṇṇamangai, beautiful jewel-like Thirukkaṇṇanur,
Thiruviṇṇagaram, famous Thirukkaṇṇapuram,
Thirucheṛai, Thiruvazhundur,
Thirukkuḍandai, Thirukkaḍigai, Thirukkaḍalmallai,
Thiruviḍavendai, Thiruneermalai,
the famous Thirumālirunjolai, Thirumohur,
Thiruvadari praised by all,
northern Madurai and all other places of the god
without missing any.
I prattle on saying the thousand names
of the famous, lotus-eyed god
adorned with thulasi garlands dripping with honey
who broke the tusk of the elephant
and saved Gajendra from the crocodile,
Even if the villagers say nasty things about me
I will surely ride on a horse made of palm leaves.

## 22. Periyathirumaḍal - Thirumangai (2713 -2790)
    (78 Pāsurams)

God in his yogic sleep on the ocean.

As his bright emerald earrings throw out light,
the lord is like a large mountain
resting on the dotted snake Adisesha
with shining jewels on his thousand divine heads
The crowded stars in the sky
shine and cover him like an umbrella.(1)

The sun and moon are his lights
and the waves of the ocean fan him. (2)

The Earth goddess

At Mahābali’s sacrifice with his divine lotus feet
he measured the earth goddess
whose hair is the clouds.
and the stars are the flower garlands that decorate it.(3)

The tall hills of the Pandya king
and the divine northern Himalayas are her breasts,
and she walks like a swan. (4)
As the lord sleeps in deep yoga her beautiful hands caress his feet.

Sages in Moksha

The god created a shining lotus on his navel
and the four-headed Brahma on it. (5)
Brahma created the four Vedas
that show the path to dharma, poruḷ and happiness on the earth and moksha. (6)
Moksha can only be attained after the body has gone to the other world.
Those who want to reach it
should eat fallen fruits, dried leaves, make their bodies thin,
sleep in a hut roofed with leaves (7)
and do tapas standing in the heat of the sun
and plunging into the water in ponds.
One can only say that these are the people who could reach moksha.
This is what one knows.
No one can tell others could reach moksha
by any other way unless they see them there. (8)

If you know any people who have reached moksha,
crossing the world of heat (9) tell us who they are.
Without knowing their names
just to say that we know that they reached moksha
shows that they are ignorant.
We will talk about them later. (9-10)

The sages enter Indra’s world and enjoy it. (11 - 22)

Let us look at the life of sages.
As the gods praise them,
they enter the golden world of Indra,
the thousand-eyed king of the gods.
They sit on shining thrones (11 and 12)
where young women with long sword-like eyes fan them
and a fresh breeze blows on them. (13)
There gentle doe-eyed women with waists as thin as lightning
smile with their white teeth that shine
like the rising crescent moon.
The sages see the karpaga forest glittering like gold
where bees in the groves sing sweetly
and the honey from the blossoms
of the Mandaram trees that grow everywhere
and they play in that world with the dark-eyed Apsaras
with waists thin as lightning and beautiful as peacocks . (14)
They stay in the golden diamond-studded mandapam
whose marble shines and with coral pillars
and there they listen contentedly to the sweet music
that the Aparasas play on their yāzhs. (15)

Indra’s Palace (16 -22)

The sages stay in palaces that shine like lightning
as the clouds float above them.
The moon shines from the sky
and many bright lamps hang in the rooms where they stay(16).
Women with lovely cool eyes,
wearing flowers that drip honey in their hair,
spread beds and open the doors for them. ((17)
There men wear fragrant mandaram flower garlands on their arms
and bees from the karpaga flowers swarm around them.
Swans wander in the garden.
The sweet fresh breeze enters their room
and dries the fragrant sandal paste that the Apsarasas
have smeared on their young breasts. (18)
The men joyfully put their hands on the lightning-like waists
and the ornaments on the women’s breasts make noise.(19)
The sound of their jewels give joy to the hearts of the men.
They drink the nectar from the mouths of the women
with large eyes that never blink,
enjoying their doe-like look and lovely smiles. (20)

Such is the result of their penance,
which at best achieves only passion.
I have described (21)
Doe-eyed women who walk like swans
will not ride on maḍal when they love men
even if others gossip about them.
I have heard this and know it from the southern tradition,
but I don’t want to worry about that.
I haveonly described what the northern tradition says. (22)

23 - 28. Those who do not want to follow the northern tradition
will not know the coolness of the sandal paste
from the Podiyam hills of Pandyan kings. (23)
They will not understand the beauty of the sweet music
of the flutes of the cowherds,
or the suffering of women when hear the bells of the cows
returning home in the evening. (24)
When they hear the sorrowful sound
of the calling of the andril birds on the palm tree
separated from their mates, they will not feel pain. (25)
When the shining moon in the sky sends its cool rays,
their bodies will not burn. (26)

When Kama shoots his flower arrows from his everlasting bow
they will not die and go to the golden street in heaven. (27)
They will stay on their flower beds
with women whose hair is decorated with flowers
as a breeze caresses their waists and soft breasts,
and they will sleep with those women who are precious like gold.
Let them enjoy themselves. (28)

Women who suffered to find and follow their beloveds.

Vaidehi.
Rama going to the forest with Vaidehi.

Rama obeyed his father, the heroic king Dasaratha,
gave up the rich kingdom
making all the people of the kingdom suffer
and left his country. (29)
He went fast as lightning in a bright chariot,
wandered in a hot forest
where murderous hungry peys wandered.
The paths there were filled with stones
and bamboo plants were broken and burned,
and the wind blew wildly (30)
Vaidehi, his beautiful wife, went with him,
walking like a swan on her soft cotton-like feet
on stone paths where the cruel sun’s strong heat
burned the earth. (31)

Vegavathi searching for her beloved.

When Vegavathi, a young girl
with a waist as thin as lightning
lost her husband as dear as her life,
she went with her elder brother to find him.
They searched and finally found him
who was strong as a bull, with mighty arms like stone
and she embraced his golden chest. (32)

The daughter of Nagarajan of the snake world finding Arjuna.

Arjuna the matchless hero,
whose shining long spear killed his enemies,
was the son of Guru, the king of the famous country
where the Ganges flows with abundant water.
The beautiful daughter of the king of snakes
without shyness, fear or modesty
embraced him, crushing her breasts
on his mountain-like golden chest
and took him to the snake world
where she loved him and they lived happily.
Haven’t we heard that story? (33 -36)

Usha, Vāṇan’s daughter and Māyavan.

Vāṇan, the king of the Asurans with a shining sword
ruled a golden country that was like Indra’s world
and conquered the whole earth surrounded by the oceans.
His daughter was more beautiful than any other woman. (37)
Her dear friend obtained the thulasi garland
of the lord Māyavan with lovely mountain-like arms and gave it to Usha.
Then she brought the god Māyavan to her
so that he could be happy with her.
O friends, haven’ṭ you heard this story? (37 -39)

Parvathi doing tapas to marry Shiva.

O, beautiful girls, what more can I say?
Uma, the precious daughter of the king of Himalayas,
was as divine as a goddess, with teeth like shining jewels and a red mouth,
a soft waist and the walk of a swan.
As she did tapas to see Shiva, wearing her hair as matted locks her golden body
withered and she controlled all her senses.

Shiva came to the forest where she was doing tapas,
extending his thousand arms and hands
in all the eight directions and shining like fire.
His feet adorned with heroic anklets
crossed all the seven precious worlds and went to the sky.
The gods in the sky worshiped the lord
and the everlasting mountains, the wind and the stars
whirled around the dancer Shiva adorned with vibhuthi.
She praised the trident of the dancing lord
that destroys Asurans and embraced him.

She says,
“Don’t you know that I have done bad karma
and have not received the grace of the god like they have?
If I begin to tell all the stories of wonderful women
it will be endless like the Bharatham. (40 -42)

"I will tell how I suffer from love—listen.
I entered the golden door
of the palace studded with diamonds,
as large as the mountain in Thirunaṛaiyur
surrounded with thick groves
where good Vediyars recite the Vedas (43)
and I saw the lord there and my eyes rejoiced.
His divine chest, mouth, feet, beautiful hands
and eyes shone like flowers blooming in a forest on a golden mountain.
His chest is adorned with a long thread
and he wears arm bracelets, shining earrings, chains, a tall crown
and a Sulamaṇi ornament that shines like the bright sun
as he shines like an emerald hill. (45)

She describes Lakshmi

Lakshmi his wife, like a beautiful young vanji creeper
stays near him.
Her walk is like a swan’s,
her eyes are innocent like a doe’s,
she is lovely as a peacock
and shines like lightning.
Her arms are like young bamboo,
her breasts are like two pots,
her mouth is red like a thondai fruit
and her eyes are like two kendai fish.
Divine, she stood near him
but I did not see her as she stood there.

She says,
“My heart and my mind grew weak,
the bracelets on my hands
and the golden mekalai on my waist grew loose.
The roaring of the ocean increases the pain of my love. (46)
and the cool moon sheds its hot rays on me.
How is it their nature has changed?
The sweet breeze carrying the fragrance of the blossoms
on the southern king Pandiyan’s mountain Pothiyam,
mingled with the smell of sandal wood and the pollen of flowers
blows making all the people of the world happy.
But to me that fresh breeze is as if burning air were streaming on me.
As the andril bird in a nest made of screw pine flower on a palm tree
calls her beloved male bird with her small voice
it is like a sword splitting open my chest.
What can I do? “

She says,
“Kama has a sugarcane bow in his arms that are strong as stone.
He bends it, flexing his arms, and shoots flower arrows (47)
at me with my chest as his target.
There is no one to protect me from him.” (48)

She says,
“I am innocent.
What is the use of my being a woman, my beauty and my breasts
if I cannot embrace the golden chest of the lord
who shines like a golden hill
and is the beloved of Lakshmi?

If my breasts do not embrace the lord of Thirukaṇṇapuram
my breasts and my beauty will become like a blooming creeper
that withers spreading its fragrance in vain
in a stony forest in a dry land

All these things are burden for me.
Is there anyone who knows a remedy to
stop this pain of love that keeps increasing?( 49, 50)

The sound of the bells tied on the necks of the cows
in the evening is sweet for most people, (51)
but to my ears it is as cruel as the sound of a killing spear.
Tell me how I can save myself from this pain, tell me. (52)
The cloud-colored lord
whose chest is adorned with a fragrant thulasi garland
gave me this love sickness.” (53)

The heroism of the Lord and how she riding on madal after
telling the power of Thirumāl. (54 - 78)

She says,
“He released the beautiful crescent moon from his curse,
built a bridge on the ocean to go to Lanka,
shot his arrows and fought with king Rāvaṇa in a cruel battle
made his ten heads decorated with golden crowns fall to the ground
and sent him to the golden world in the sky.” (54).

Hiraṇyan and the man-lion.

She says,
“Hiraṇyan with his strong hands
fought with thousand-eyed Indra, king of the gods
and the gods and took over Indra’s world
and the golden world of the gods.
Our god with a discus in his mighty hand
took the form of a lion (55)
went to Hiraṇyan with fiery eyes and fought with him,
pulling the Asuran by the hair,
sitting him on his thigh,
and splitting open his chest with his sharp claws.

God in the form of a boar

“When the earth goddess was hidden
in the bottom of the ocean by an Asuran,
our god, the dancer, took the form of a boar,
went into the ocean and brought up the earth goddess
on his sharp murderous tusks. (56)

Thirumāl churning the milky ocean with gods and Asurans.

“Using Mandara mountain as a churning stick
and the snake Vasuki as the rope,
he churned the milky ocean
and the bright sun, moon and all shining things
in the sky swirled around as he churned.
The generous god took the sweet nectar from the ocean,
gave it to the gods in the sky
and removed their affliction. (57)

God in the form of a dwarf

“Taking the form of a dwarf whom no one could recognize
he went as a bachelor to the golden sacrifice of king Mahābali. (58)
He cheated the heroic king, melted his heart by pretending to be a sage.
He asked the king,
‘O king, I want three feet of land
and I will measure the distance with my feet.’
Before the dwarf could finish speaking,
the king said, ‘I have already given that.’
At those words, (59)
the god grew tall and his crown, shining like lightning,
touched the sky and his ankleted feet crossed over all the seven worlds.(60)
All the gods and the Asurans saw him and trembled
as his feet went upwards and took over the wide world and the sky.
He cheated Mahābali with his feet and made all the world his own.” (61)

She praises the Divyadesams where the god stays and worships him

“He, the beloved of the goddess with a lighting-like waist,
fights in the war like a bull.
He stays on the golden mountain of Thiruviṇṇagar
and he is the god of the flourishing Kudandai
where the Ponni river brings jewel and leaves them on its banks.
Majestic as a red coral hill,
he is the god of Thirukkkuṛunguḍi in the Pandiyan country.
He is the generous god of Thiruthaṇcheṛai. (62)
my sweet nectar and the god of Thiruvayalāli
surrounded with beautiful water where swans sleep.
Strong as a mountain, he is the god of Thiruyevvuḷ,
and generous as the kaṛpagam tree,
and the god of Thirukkaṇṇamangai surrounded with strong forts.
He is lightning, the bright sun and moon
and the god of Thiruveḷḷaṛai.
As precious as gold, he is the god of Thirukkallaṛai.
Gold and emerald, a fighting bull, he is the god of Thirupuṭkuzhi.
He, the god of everlasting Srirangam
shines like a precious diamond. (63)

He, the beloved of Lakshmi, stays in Thiruvallavāzh.
Never born, he is the god of Thirupperur.
He lies on Adisesha on the ancient ocean,
He is a faultless shining jewel and he stays in my mind always.
He is the lord of Thiruviḍaventhai,
the Māyavan, the god of Thirukkaḍalmallai, (64)
worshipped by the gods in the sky

He is the strong god of Thiruthangāl,
the essence known by no one, a pearl.
He took the form of a swan, fish, man-lion
and he is the divine Vedas whose meaning no one knows.
He swallowed all the worlds in ancient times. (65)
He is the god of everlasting Thiruviḍaikkazhi
who drank the milk from Putana as she screamed, (66)
the shining god of Thiruvazhundur
where swans look for food in the wet mud.
He, my dear lord, stays in south Thillaichithrakuḍam, (67)
the clever god of Thiruvenkaṭam where clouds move with lightning.
He, a king and the beloved of Lakshmi, stays in Thirumālirunjolai
carrying a discus that kills his enemies. (68)
He has the form of a man-lion in Thirukkoṭṭiyur,
a flood of sweet nectar and the god of Thirumeyyam,
the good Andaṇan of Thiruvindaḷur,
the man-lion of Thiruveḷukkai in Thirukkachi
surrounded with strong forts.
He is the young god of Thiruppāḍagam, (69)
the god of Thiruvekkaa sunk in deep yoga.
He is the god of Thiruvuragam,
the strong bull of Thiruvaṭṭapuyagaram
and the Esan who stays in my heart. (70)

He, the god of the gods,
is the light of Thirumuzhikkaḷam
and the god of Thiruvādanur giving food to all.
He is past, present and future, (71)
the god of Thiruneermalai and the four everlasting Vedas.

He is Tamizh flourishing in Thiruppullāṇi in the Pandiyan country and he is Sanskrit.
He is the beloved of Lakshmi and shines like the moon,
the god of Maṇimādakkoyil in Naagai,
and the god of Thiruchengāḍu surrounded by the ocean. (72)
I worship the god Kaṇṇan,
the lord of Thirukkaṇṇapuram
and of Maṇimāḍakkoyil in southern Thirunaṛaiyur.”

She says,
“He is as strong as a bull with arms like mountains.
I will go and see him, folding my hands and worshiping him.
I will tell him how I feel,
if my dear lord does not give his grace
holding me close to his chest, (73)

I will go to the villages where girls with lightning-thin waists,
Vediyars and sages live
and tell the kings with spears that kill enemies in battles
and all the crowds of people
and the people who live in all countries
about all the things he has done to me.” (74) .

She says,
“When he went to the cowherd village,
stole butter and yogurt churned and kept
by beautiful fish-eyed cowherd women,
and ate them and filled his stomach full,
the women caught him and tied him to a mortar.
When he took the form of a bhudam
and ate all the food that the cowherds had kept for Indra, (75)
Indra grew angry, brought a storm,
and the lord carried Govardhana mountain
as an umbrella and protected the cowherds
and the cows from the storm.

When Kaṇṇan went to Duriyodhana’s assembly
for the Pandavas as a messenger,
he was disgraced by the Kauravas.
He danced on a pot as drums were beaten
and beautiful women saw looked on in enjoyment,
exclaiming, ‘How could he dance so wonderfully?’

When Surpankaha, the princess of Lanka, Ravana's sister,
fell in love with Rama, took the form of a beautiful woman
and came to the forest and told Rama that she loved him, (76)
Rama was angry and cut off her nose.
He also killed the mighty Thāḍagai (77)
when she came to fight with him.

MADAL

I will think of all these deeds
and ride on horse made of palm leaves, the maḍal,
of a flourishing palm tree.” (78)

## 23. Thiruvāymozhi - Nammāzhvār (2791 – 3892)
2791. O my heart!
      The matchless god of the gods in the sky
      who has unlimited goodness
      never grows tired of protecting the world.
      Removing my ignorance he gave me abundant knowledge.
      Worship his shining feet that take away all sorrows.

2792. The ageless lord who is full of goodness
      and keeps Nānmuhan on a lotus on his chest
      removes the faults in your mind.
      There is no limit to what he can think
      and he is not attracted by any feelings of the senses.
      Whatever happens does not affect him.
      He is in my soul and he is ageless.

2793. I approached the unique lord
      who is full of goodness, endless, omnipresent and formless.
      The earth and sky are his forms
      and no one knows what he has and what he does not have.
      I approached him and joined with him.

2794. The omnipresent god is this man, that man, the man over there,
      this woman, that woman, the woman over there,
      this one, that one, this thing, that thing,
      these and those over there.
      Who is he? What is he?
      The god who is good and evil is our own.

2795. People think variously,
      “This one is my god, that one is my god.”
      They will reach the feet of the god they choose according to their fate
      and he will give them all things that they want.

2796. He stands, sits, lies and wanders,
      does not stand, does not sit,
      does not lie and does not wander.
      No one knows what his nature is but he has only one nature
      and he is the mighty one.

2797. The shining one is the Vedas, the wide sky,
      the mighty wind, water, earth, and all the things in the world.
      He hides himself in the bodies and lives of all creatures
      and is omnipresent.

2798. The highest lord swallowed all the worlds
      and burned the three forts of his enemies.
      As Shiva he destroyed the world
      and he taught the Vedas to Nānmuhan and the gods.
      Even the gods in the sky wonder about his nature.

2799. If one believes he exists, he exists.
      If one believes he has a form, he does.
      If one believes he has no form, he has none.
      He has both natures, “he is and he is not,” and he is omnipresent.

2800. He pervades the water of the cool wide ocean,
      all the worlds, the vast sky
      and all the places that no one knows.
      He is hidden in everything that shines,
      the sun, moon and stars
      and he swallowed all of them and spat them out.

2801. Saḍagopan of Thirukkuruhur
      composed a thousand pāsurams worshiping the feet of the lord
      who is the sky, the strong wind, water, earth,
      the rainbow and the everlasting mountains.
      If devotees learn and recite these ten pāsurams
      they will reach moksha.

2802. Give up all the desires
      that you have for earthly things
      and surrender your life to the god, the lord of moksha.
      That will take you to moksha.

2803. Our earthly bodies will go away
      like lightning from the earth one day,
      and they come and go in a second.
      If you know this, you will only think of him, the everlasting one.

2804. Give up utterly any desire
      that is for yourself or the things you own,
      and join and worship him.
      There is nothing equal or higher than he in life.

2805. The things that are in the world
      and the things that are not in the world are his forms.
      Give up your desires, grasp his wonderful, matchless form
      and worship him.

2806. If you give up desire for worldly things
      you will reach moksha.
      The only help that you should have in this world
      is the desire to join him.

2807. O my soul, give up all your desires,
      approach him and become one with the lord.
      He is in all things in the world
      and does not have any desire.
      There is nothing without him.

2808. If you understand
      that all the things in the world are contained in him,
      you will realize that you yourself are in him
      and you will join him.

2809. Remove any desire from your mind,
      any desire to say something,
      any desire to do something.
      Join him and become one with him.

2810. Removing your desires for this world,
      if you only think of him always when you live on this earth,
      when you leave your body you will join him.

2811. Countless souls of the world
      unlimited in their knowledge
      and shining as a part of him will join the strong feet
      of the famous Nāraṇan.

2812. Saḍagopan of southern Thirukkuruhur
      surrounded by beautiful ponds filled with water
      composed a thousand pāsurams
      and these are ten wonderful pāsurams among those.

2813. The clever lord, the beloved of Lakshmi,
      stole butter that was churned by Yashoda
      and was so simple that he allowed Yashoda to punish him
      by tying him to a mortar.
      He is easy for his devotees to reach
      but hard for others to attain.

2814. The everlasting faultless almighty
      who has no births
      removes the delusion of his devotees
      and gracefully gives them moksha.
      He stays in all hearts
      and is outside and inside of everything.

2815. He, the highest one
      and is easy for his devotees to reach,
      is the path of dharma,
      the creator and the destroyer of the world,
      all the gods in the sky
      and all the creatures of the world.
      Who knows the māyā of Nāraṇan
      whose nature is excellent?

2816. He, the light of knowledge,
      has a thousand names
      and any name that is conceivable, yet he has no name or form.
      No one knows who he is or what his nature is. Is he not a mystery!

2817. The six schools of religions agree
      that he is faultless and has no beginning or end.
      O devotees, if you follow the path of penance
      and leave all worldly desires,
      having only the belief that he is your god,
      the desires of your senses will go away.

2818. O devotees,
      even if you reach the state of having no desire,
      you cannot know who he is.
      Worship the gods Hari, Ayan and Shiva
      and learn to recite their names many times
      and you will come to know and your mind will understand
      that there is only one god.

2819. Even though people say that the powerful gods
      Nāraṇan, Nānmuhan and Shiva have one or many forms,
      if you worship them in your mind and meditate on them
      you will find that they are only Nāraṇan himself
      and you will do good deeds.
      The day you come to know that he is the only god,
      that will be the best of all your days.

2820. If you worship him every day
      you will become faultless
      and the bad karma that you have collected will leave you
      and your mind will become pure.
      Keep worshiping his ornamented feet every day.
      Even when you die, it is best to die worshiping him.

2821. Shiva, the destroyer of the three forts,
      stays on his left side and Nānmuhan,
      the creator of the world with heads in all four directions,
      stays on a lotus on his navel.
      If you search for him,
      he is in this world and inside your mind.
      If you would describe him, the entire world is in his stomach.
      This is how he loves to confuse you.

2822. The dark-colored lord is mightier than the sky,
      and he makes even the wise gods confused
      with his faultless knowledge and māyas.
      He did not grow tired
      even when he measured the earth and the sky—
      I will praise him without growing weary,
      I will embrace and bow to him.

2823. Saḍagopan of Thirukkuruhur
      that flourishes with beautiful groves
      composed a thousand pāsurams
      about him who churned the milky ocean with roaring waves
      as the other gods worshiped him.
      If devotees learn and recite these ten pāsurams
      they will not be born again
      and they will go to heaven and stay with the gods.

2824. She says,
      “O crane, you have lovely wings, be kind to me.
      If you and your mate with beautiful wings
      feel sorry for me and say, ‘Oh, oh!’
      and go as my messengers to him
      who rides a strong-winged eagle,
      do you worry that he might put you in a terrible cage
      and you could do nothing?”

2825. She says,
      “O cuckoo birds, what will happen to you
      if you go as my messengers and tell of my love sickness
      to the beautiful lotus-eyed lord?
      I cannot serve under his divine feet
      because I did not do good karma in my previous births.
      Is it right that I should not be able to join him in this birth
      because I did not try in my last birth?
      Is that my fate?”

2826. She says,
      “O swans, you walk softly with your mates
      because you have good luck.
      He went as a dwarf, begged the Asura king Mahābali at his sacrifice
      and cheated him by taking the earth from him.
      Isn't he a thief?
      Go and tell him, ‘There is an ignorant girl.
      She feels that she must have done much bad karma.
      Her mind is confused and she is fascinated with you.’”

2827. She says,
      “O beautiful blue andril birds,
      the dark-colored one doesn’t know how I suffer for his love.
      He doesn’t come to me and tell me, ‘Don’t worry.’
      What can I say to tell him how I love him?
      Go and tell him whose nature is so wonderful and sweet
      that she will not survive
      if she has to be apart from him anymore.
      O andril birds, will you help me or not?”

2828. She says,
      “O lovely small kurugu birds,
      you search for food in the fields filled with water where fish swim.
      Nāraṇan has created all the seven worlds and protects them.
      Won't he give me his grace and protect me also?
      Won’t you go see him and tell him of my love
      and show kindness by returning
      and telling me what he said?
      I will wait, my eyes filled with tears,
      until you return and tell me what he said.”

2829. She says,
      “O bees with beautiful lined bodies, be kind to me.
      He is generous, and he carries a discus.
      Go, see him and tell him, ‘She loves you
      but you do not give your grace to her.
      Come just one day to her street riding on your eagle
      before she loses her life.’
      What have I done wrong
      that he does not want to give me his grace?”

2830. She says,
      “O young parrot, go to Neḍumāl as my messenger.
      I suffer like someone trembling in a cold wind
      that makes your bones hurt.
      Thirumāl does not give his grace
      and he doesn’t understand that I haven’t done anything wrong.
      Go to him and say, ‘What has she done wrong?
      Why can she not come and join your divine feet?’
      What would be wrong if you told him that?
      Aren't you the bird that I have raised?
      You are young and you should help me.”

2831. She says,
      “O small puvai bird, I told you to go as a messenger
      and tell Neḍumāl of my love sickness,
      but you didn’t tell him and my body has grown weak
      and lost its shining color and beauty.
      Go now and find someone to feed you,
      putting sweet food in your mouth as I used to do.”

2832. She says,
      “O cool wind that passes over the dew,
      the god created people to bring flowers that do not wither
      and place them at his flower-like feet.
      Why does he make me suffer and be apart from him?
      I don’t know what to do. Did I do bad karma?
      Is this right? Go and tell him how I suffer.”

2833. She says,
      "O ignorant heart, our dear one has a discus in his hands
      and rests on a snake bed on the ocean.
      He creates births, bodies, people, moksha and water on the ocean.
      If you see him, tell him, ‘Though we have bad karma
      we will not leave him until we join with him.’”

2834. Saḍagopan of Thirukkuruhur
      surrounded with flourishing fields swarming with bees
      composed a thousand andadi poems
      praising our Kaṇṇan, the lord of the seven worlds.
      If devotees learn and recite these ten pāsurams
      they will have the good fortune of going to heaven
      and joining the gods.

2835. I have done much bad karma.
      I call to you, the god of the gods in the sky
      and the most ancient one in all the seven rich worlds, saying,
      “O thief! You stole butter and ate it all!”
      and I praise you, saying,
      “You are my father, the heroic chief of the cowherds.
      You conquered the seven young bulls
      to marry Nappinnai whose smile is like blooming jasmine.”
      I think of you and suffer and suffer.

2836. Melting in their hearts the gods in the sky think of you,
      the Māyon, the seed of all things in the world,
      and worship you with garlands, water,
      sandal paste and fragrant incense.
      Won’t your excellence be spoiled
      if the gods use only earthly things to worship you?

2837. He created the divine Nānmuhan and told him,
      “You should create all the gods in the sky,
      all with their own duties,
      the sages and all creatures in the world.”
      He measured the world and the sky with his divine feet
      and he is so far away that all knowledge
      and all the directions cannot reach him.
      He is the mother of all lives but no one knows his form.

2838. The lord with a unique form,
      the seed of the three gods, of all the gods in the sky,
      of the sages and all other creatures,
      resting on the snake bed Adisesha
      on the water-filled ocean that he created,
      is the Māyon, the god of Vaikuṇṭam,
      and he is dear to me.

2839. O sapphire-colored Madhava,
      you are a bright light for the gods in the sky
      and on your chest you embrace the innocent doe-eyed Lakshmi.
      O Govinda, who shot a stone from your bow
      and hit the hunched back of Kuni,
      I have done bad karma.
      Give me your grace, Madhusudana,
      so that I will be able to join your divine feet
      that are like flowers that drip with honey.

2840. O Kesava, you are the lord of the gods in the sky,
      the chief of the cowherd clan of the village,
      and you destroyed the seven mara trees flourishing with branches.
      You, the Māyavan, are the remedy for the fruits of my bad karma.
      O Sridhara, heroic Madhava, I am your slave
      and I melt with devotion and long to reach you, saying,
      “Your nature is wonderful. You have thousands of names!”

2841. The lord Kaṇṇan, Thirumāl adorned with a thulasi garland,
      removes the troubles of his devotees if they reach him.
      I, his ignorant slave, cry out and cry out that I want to see
      the lord who is hard for even the wise to know.
      Is there anything I could do more than worshiping him?

2842. In ancient times you swallowed the seven worlds
      and spat them out and when you were a small child
      you ate butter in a house where cowherds lived.
      O Māyon, do you think that butter can cure your stomach
      when it is upset because you ate mud?

2843. When the cheating devil Putana came as a mother
      and fed him her poisonous milk,
      he, the Māyan, changed it into nectar and drank it.
      He, the matchless chief of the gods in the sky,
      the beloved of Laksmi, the goddess of wealth,
      the mother of all lives of the world, is the lord of all.
      I have joined him and I will not be separated from him.

2844. He is the light of high knowledge,
      the inner soul of all life
      and he has a form yet is formless.
      He dwells in the sky and in the underworld
      and destroyed my good and bad karma and my desire for this illusory world.
      Our Neḍumāl, the life of all creatures,
      makes my mind think only of him.

2845. Saḍagopan of everlasting Thirukkuruhur praised him saying,
      “You are the dark-colored one! You are the wonderful Māyavan!”
      He composed a thousand poems
      that Tamil scholars and singers learn to praise him.
      If devotees learn and recite these ten pāsurams well
      they will not have any trouble in their lives.

2846. O devotees,
      you bathe him with pure water, show him fragrance,
      sprinkle flowers on his feet and sing his praises,
      wanting to join him in moksha,
      but the path to join him is to think of him always
      and not be separated from him.

2847. He is adorned with a beautiful cool thulasi garland
      that drips with honey.
      Do not wonder what service you can do
      for the ancient god of the Vedas,
      just do what you can do—
      that is the best service you can give him.

2848. My mind does not leave him ever, the highest lord.
      He does not consider one person high and another low
      and accepts everyone and my mouth praises him with songs,
      and my body dances for him as if it were possessed.

2849. My body dances as if possessed
      and I bow and worship
      the lord whom the gods in the sky worship and praise,
      extolling his superior nature.

2850. He is nectar for those who keep him in their minds
      and does not think anyone is good or bad
      but gives his grace to all.
      He does not hate anyone or like anyone
      but helps all whether they expect something from him or not.

2851. Our Neḍumal, sweeter than nectar,

2945.The lord with large eyes as beautiful as lotuses,
a mouth as sweet as a fruit and red as a lotus, feet as lovely as lotuses,
a divine body as pure as gold, with a conch and a discus in his hands
and wearing garlands, ornaments and a sacred thread on his chest,
came, entered my heart and gave his love to me.

2946. He has divine body shining like the sun in the sky,
      lovely eyes and hands like beautiful lotuses,
      and he keeps Thirumagaḷ on his chest, Nānmuhan on his navel
      and Shiva as a part of his body.
      I have no place on his body but he has entered my heart.

2947. He has a lotus mouth as sweet as a fruit
      and eyes, feet and hands like beautiful lotuses.
      He shines like a bright hill
      and all the everlasting seven worlds are in his stomach.
      There is nothing in the world that is not inside him,
      and he has entered in my heart.

2948. He, precious like a emerald hilll, is in all things.
      His eyes, hands and feet are like fresh lotuses
      and he is as sweet as a nectar that will never become bitter
      on any day, any month, any year
      or any time until the end of the world.

2949. He is the nectar that will always be sweet,
      a dark cloud that has entered my heart.
      Even red coral cannot compete
      with my dear Kaṇṇan’s lovely red mouth.
      His eyes, feet and hands are like lotuses
      and he wears a long garland, a tall crown,
      an oṭṭiyāṇam around his waist and many other ornaments.

2950. He of many names and bright forms is adorned with many ornaments
      and his qualities are too many to conceive.
      He has wonderful knowledge and rests on a snake bed.
      He is the joy of seeing, tasting, hearing, touching and smelling.

2951. He rests on a snake bed on the milky ocean
      killed seven bulls to marry Nappinnai
      whose lovely arms are like bamboo
      and he destroyed the seven mara trees
      in groves where honey drips.
      His golden crown is adorned
      with a cool thulasi garland tied with flowers.

2952. The omnipresent four-armed one,
      as strong as a bull, wears a golden crown and a cool thulasi garland.
      He has entered my heart and forgiven my faults.
      I do not have the words to praise him—
      tell me how I can describe him.

2953. Shining like a dark diamond,
      he is the soul within my soul.
      With his endless fame he, neither male nor female,
      is sweet nectar, moksha that is so hard to attain,
      and the fragrance of alli flowers.

2954. He is not male, not female,
      and he is not an ali, who is neither.
      No one can see him.
      He neither is, nor is he not.
      When a devotee wishes to see him
      he will appear in whatever form the devotee wishes
      or he may not be there.
      To describe the dear lord is very hard.

2955 Saḍagopan of Thirukkuruhur
composed a thousand andādi pāsurams on him,
our father who danced the wonderful kuḍakuthu dance,
whom no one can describe.
If devotees learn these ten pāsurams and recite them well
they will reach Vaikuṇṭam.

2956. O lord of Vaikuṇṭam colored like a blue sapphire,
      you are a naughty divine dwarf,
      nectar that has entered my heart and remains there always,
      and a strong bull worshiped by the gods.
      You remove the troubles of your devotees,
      and destroy the Asurans,
      and though you stay in Vaikuṇṭam, you are with me.

2957. He swallowed all the worlds leaving nothing behind
      and he kept them in his stomach.
      Changeless, he is a flood of knowledge,
      a faultless bright light and nectar for all.
      There is no place on this earth
      that is not seen by the lotus eyes of Kaṇṇan.
      He has entered my heart.

2958. His eyes are as beautiful as lotuses
      and the gods worship him as their lord.
      He, the dear one, adorned with fragrant flower garlands
      shining like a golden mountain,
      gave me the good fortune of approaching him and worshiping him.
      I dance happily thinking of him always.
      He, the generous one, gave me his grace
      to sing beautiful pāsurams that praise him.

2959. You, the generous Madhusudanan,
      my emerald hill and my father, gave me the good fortune
      of thinking only of you. How could I leave you?
      I praised your fame that is like a flood,
      danced and sang with joy
      and all my sickness and troubles went away.

2960. O my father, you rest on the five-headed snake Adisesha
      on the milky ocean in yogic contemplation.
      I escaped my troubles
      and you destroyed all my cruel karma.
      Now I have become your slave forever—
      how could I ever want anything else?

2961. I thought and thought of you
      and praised you in songs and danced
      and all the bad karma of my former births went away.
      You took the form of a man-lion
      and split open the chest of Hiraṇyan when he disgraced you.
      I am your slave. There is nothing that I cannot do.

2962. What is there that I cannot do?
      He who swallowed all the seven worlds
      came and joyfully entered the heart of me, his slave,and will not leave me.
      The terrible troubles that I have will go away.
      He protects me and saves me
      and I will not go to cruel hell in all my seven births.

2963. Born in many births again and again,
      I have reached your feet and my heart is happy
      as if it had plunged into a divine flood of bliss.
      O father who ride on a flying eagle
      you fought many Asurans, and you defeated and destroyed them.
      O dear one, do not go away from me.

2964. O my father, you are the god of Thiruvenkaṭam.
      You destroyed Lanka shooting one arrow and made all the seven maramara trees fall.
      You are nectar, adorned with bunches of beautiful cool thulasi garlands.
      O young one, strong bull among the gods,
      you have entered my heart—where will I go now?

2965. You are the past, present and future,
      and you are my father and mother and my life.
      I have reached you and will not leave you
      who are the lord of the three worlds
      that praise your ancient fame,
      O highest one, adorned with fragrant thulasi garlands,
      lord of the cool Venkaṭam hills.

2966. Saḍagopan of famous southern Thirukkuruhur
      composed a thousand andādi pāsurams
      praising the wonderful lotus-eyed Kaṇṇan
      whose hair is adorned with beautiful thulasi garlands.
      If devotees learn these ten pāsurams and sing them
      they will be the devotees of Kesavan.

2967. The lord Kaṇṇan with a beautiful form is a dark diamond
      and the lord of the gods in the sky.
      Whether they are rich or poor,
      Kesavan gives his devotees
      faultless lives for all their seven births.
      Everything happens on his earth
      because of our lord, our father Nārāyanan.

2968. Nāraṇan is the lord of the seven worlds,
      the creator of the Vedas,
      the cause, action and karma of the world, and he is my father.
      Our lord Madhavan is beautiful, worshiped by all the gods,
      and he broke the tusks of the elephant Kuvalayābeedam.

2969. As soon as I said the word Madhavan
      he came, entered my heart
      and gave me his grace
      so that no trouble will come to me.
      He is the nectar that destroys all evil,
      the lotus-eyed lord strong as a mountain
      and sweet as faultless sugar,
      and he, Govindan, is my father.

2970. My dear Govindan dances on a pot saying, “I am Gopalan!”
      and makes the gods sing and dance with him.
      My father, the strong lord who accepted me
      and removed all my faults and karma,
      gave his grace to me and to my friends and relatives
      and made us join him for all our seven births.

2971. Our father Madhusudanan
      who has beautiful lotus eyes, feet and hands
      and a divine body like a dark shining mountain,
      carries in his hands a conch bright as the moon
      and a discus that shines like the sun.

2972. I sing and dance eon after eon saying,
      “I have no refuge but you, Madhusudanan,
      and I do no work except to praise the lord.”
      He comes before me in all my births
      and gives me his grace because of my good fate.
      I have joined my father Thirivikraman.

2973. You, the mighty lord who took the form of a dwarf,
      granted me a mind to praise and worship your lotus feet eon after eon
      saying, “You, with beautiful lotus eyes, a red mouth sweet as a fruit
      and teeth white as marble are Thirivikraman, my father.”

2974. I praise your feet and worship you saying,
      “You, a dwarf with the color of an emerald
      and eyes as beautiful as lotuses are the father of Kama.”
      You gave me a pure mind, removed the troubles of birth
      and destroyed the evil thoughts in my mind.
      O Sridhara, what can I give you in return?

2975. I praised you saying,
      “You, Sridharan, have beautiful lotus eyes.”
      I was anxious and frightened day and night,
      my eyes were filled with tears, and I sighed and sighed,
      but you entered my heart and took away my bad karma.
      O my Rishikesa, every day I will keep you in my mind
      and my joy will always increase.

2976. My dear Rishikesan, the lord of the gods in the sky,
      destroyed the Rakshasa clan in Lanka.
      O heart, even if you are confused
      and do not know who the lord is,
      keep Padmanabhan firmly in your heart, bow to him
      and know surely that he is the almighty.

2977. The highest lord Padmanabhan,
      the Damodaran, god of the gods in the sky,
      dark as a cloud, sweet as nectar, generous as the Karpaga tree,
      stronger and wonderful than other gods
      and the creatures of the world
      who stays in Thiruvenkaṭam hills
      took me and gave himself to me.

2978. His devotees worship him saying,
      “He is the ancient lord and he swallowed all the seven earth.
      Is it possible for someone to know Damodharan, our lord?
      Even Nānmuhan with heads facing in all four directions and Shiva
      were not able to reach the feet or head of the ocean-colored lord.”

2979. Sadagopan of southern Thirukkuruhur
      composed a garland of a thousand Tamil pāsurams
      on Kaṇṇan, a precious jewel and bright light,
      Neḍumāl, the lord of the gods in the sky.
      If devotees learn and sing these twelve pāsurams
      they will reach the feet of the highest one.

2980. He rests on the snake bed Adisesha
      and embraces Lakshmi on his chest.
      He is moksha and the lord of all,
      and he is the beloved of the earth goddess and the goddess of wealth.
      He is the boatman for those who wants to cross the ocean of birth.

2981. If devotees join the matchless lord adorned with a thulasi garland
      who saved the elephant Gajendra
      when it was caught by a crocodile in a cool blooming pond,
      the troubles in their lives will go away
      and he will remove the ocean of sorrowful births for them
      and grant them moksha, a dwelling that has no sorrow.

2982. He keeps Nānmuhan, the creator of the world, on his navel,
      Shiva, the destroyer of the world, on the left part of his body
      and he embraces lovely Lakshmi, the goddess of wealth, on his chest.
      The lord exists everywhere and in everything you see in the world,

2983. O devotees, if you control your five senses and the pleasures they give
      and praise the divine qualities of the strong lord who killed the Asuras,
      and remain with him always, you will enter
      the endless moksha that is faultless goodness.

2984. The matchless everlasting god of the gods,
      the faultless one who protects his devotees in all the three worlds
      from their sorrowful births that come ceaselessly
      and from all trouble in their lives,
      took the forms of a horse, turtle, fish
      and human to protect this world from evil
      is my teerthan.

2985. When Arjuna saw the same garland
      on the head of Shiva that was on the feet of the faultless lord
      who measured the world,
      he realized that Kaṇṇan is the real god.
      Who can praise the excellence of the lord,
      adorned with beautiful thulasi garlands?

2986. As a dwarf the lord who rests on a snake bed on the ocean
      measured the world and the sky with his two feet.
      He split open the earth, went to the underworld as a boar
      and brought up the earth goddess
      and he swallowed the earth and spat it out.
      Who can understand the things
      that he does out of love for the earth goddess?

2987. Is there any way someone can see our dear Kaṇṇan, our Esan?
      Even though he swallows the whole world
      it is not be enough for him.
      He is omnipresent in all places,
      in the souls of all the creatures of the world
      and in all the heavens in the sky.
      There is no place where he is not.

2988. Prahladan the son of Hiraṇyan said,
      “Kaṇṇan is everywhere,”
      and his father opposed him saying,
      “See, he will not be here in this pillar,”
      but the moment he broke open the pillar
      Thirumāl came out as a man-lion and killed him.
      Who can understand the power of him
      who took the form of a lion?

2989. I saw the dark cloud-colored Kaṇṇan,
      the god of the divine world of the gods,
      of moksha, hell, the middle world,
      the root and seed of all things
      who pervades everything but also stands alone.

2990. Saḍagopan from the flourishing Pandya country
      filled with groves where bees swarm
      composed a thousand Tamil pāsurams with music
      to the dear lord with a dark body and bright eyes.
      If devotees learn these ten pāsurams and recite them well
      they will reach moksha in the sky.

2991. O dear lord , you saved the suffering elephant Gajendra from the crocodile.
      I do not wish to ask about wonderful moksha,
      I only want you to put your divine lotus feet on my head.
      This is the only thing I, your devotee, want.

2992. You, my father, colored like a dark diamond are a bright light.
      Give me the wisdom so I may reach your feet
      that no one can approach.
      Do not wait long.
      This is the only thing I always want from you.

2993. O highest lord Kaṇṇan,
      you carry a discus in your hand
      and give me your grace so I will not do evil deeds.
      Even when I die and phlegm fills my throat
      give me your grace so that
      I will praise you without forgetting you.

2994. I want him to give me grace saying,
      “Be my devotee always.”
      I want him to enter my mind making me himself
      and staying there without ever leaving.
      If I receive the grace of Kaṇṇan and make him mine
      and that is the most wonderful thing I could ever have.

2995. I do not mind
      whether I reach moksha, the heaven of the gods, or hell
      when my life leaves my body,
      but I will worship the dear unborn lord
      who takes many births in this world
      only to give his devotees his grace.
      I will not forget him ever and I will be happy.

2996. O lord who created the gods and give them happiness,
      you are the knowledge and ignorance of the world,
      the light that gives joy to all, a blooming flower.
      I want to worship you joyfully with my mind,
      my words and my deeds always.
      Come happily to me so I may worship you.

2997. Come, I want to stay beneath your divine lotus feet
      never moving from there.
      You have not given me your grace so I may reach your feet
      and you have not entered my heart.
      Come and stay in my heart always and in all situations.

2998. You, worshiped by faultless sages who are the learned in the Vedas
      are as sweet as a fruit made of jaggery
      If you will always be my father and stay in my heart,
      I will not ask you for anything else.

2999. I did not understand myself
      and thought only of myself and my possessions,
      but now I know that I am you and all that I own is yours.
      O lord, you are a bull among the gods
      and all the gods in the sky praise you.

3000. You conquered the seven bulls
      and are the bright light
      that burned and destroyed famous Lanka.
      Do not rely on my efforts
      but make me join your golden feet soon
      and do not make me go anywhere else.

3001. Saḍagopan of Thirukkuruhur
      composed a thousand faultless pāsurams
      on the highest one who carries a heroic discus.
      If devotees learn and recite these ten faultless pāsurams
      they will reach moksha where there is no suffering.

3002. Before you grow old and your youth goes away
      it is good to go to the temple
      where Māyon shines in Thirumalirunjolai
      surrounded by fresh flourishing groves.
      Going there, worshiping him without holding back X
      and dancing is the best thing you can do.

3003. The purpose of your life
      is to go to that temple and worship him
      in Thirumalirunjolai hills
      where the moon shines on the tops of the peaks
      and the roaring sound of the conches
      in the beautiful lord’s temple
      is louder than the music of the dances
      of lovely young women.

3004. O heart! Doing useless things is not fruitful.
      The purpose of your life is to go to the divine hill
      of Thirumalirunjolai surrounded by beautiful groves
      and to worship the cloud-colored lord there.

3005. The right thing is to go to the divine Thirumalirunjolai
      where clouds that drop rain move around the famous hills
      and worship the lord
      who carried Govardhana mountain
      to save the cowherds and the cows from the storm
      and remove the bad karma of all people.

3006. Do not increase your karma doing bad things in your life.
      Go to the temple in Thirumalirunjolai
      surrounded by pure beautiful springs
      and worship him who carries the discus.
      That is the dharmic path that you should take.

3007. Do not do bad deeds
      but think of doing good deeds.
      He who stole butter from the pot kept in the uri
      stays in the temple in Thirumalirunjolai
      where deer play with their fawns.
      It is good to think of him and worship him with devotion.

3008. Think only of doing good deeds and you will not go to hell.
      The lord who took the form of a boar and split open the earth
      stays in the temple of Thirumalirunjolai
      where the faultless bright moon shines.
      If you circle that hill,
      goodness will abound in your life.

3009. Do not do bad things and spend your life in vain.
      Go around the temple of Māyavan every day
      where the gods come and circle the hills of Thirumalirunjolai.
      Get into the habit of circling that hill
      and it will bring you good fortune.

3010. Do not think it is just a custom to circle the temple.
      If you circle the temple in Thirumalirunjolai
      where strong male elephants live together in groups
      and worship the lord who killed the devil Putana
      when she came to feed him poisonous milk,
      bad karma will not come to you
      and you will be successful in whatever you do.

3011. Do not steal and gamble thinking
      that you will gain something.
      The lord who taught the Vedas to the sages
      stays in the temple in Thirumalirunjolai where beautiful peacocks dance.
      To go to that mountain where beautiful flowers bloom
      should be the object of your life.

3012. The generous Saḍagopan of Thirukkuruhur
      composed a thousand good pāsurams
      about the famous lord whose purpose was to create this world
      and who gives his grace to all.
      If devotees learn and recite these ten poems
      they will reach his feet.

3013. Is it your bright face that makes your crown shine?
      Is it the bright light of your feet that makes them bloom like lotuses?
      Is it the brightness of your golden waist that gives light
      to your clothes and your precious ornaments?
      Tell me, O Thirumāl.

3014. You are highest shining lord!
      A lotus cannot be compared
      to the beauty of your eyes and feet,
      and pure gold cannot be compared to the brightness
      of your divine body.
      All the praises of you that this world utters are merely meaningless.

3015. O Govinda, I do not have the ability to praise you
      who are the highest unique light
      and who created the world,
      swallowed it and kept it inside you.
      There is no other brightness that can be compared with you,

3016. The people of this world do not know
      how to worship your beautiful lotus form.
      You created many religions
      for the people of the world to follow,
      but you are interested only in the thulasi garland that you wear.
      Don't you think this large world will suffer without you
      if you do not save its people and take care of them?

3017. You have a bright body that is like a beautiful flower
      that you acquired without any austerities.
      You who are the past, present and future are profound wisdom
      and no boundary can include all the places where you are.
      You give your grace in all ages to the world.
      How can I describe your power?

3018. Your hair is adorned with flowers and a fresh thulasi garland
      and Lakshmi stays on a lotus on your chest.
      All the Vedas and the sastras that are recited by the sages
      and everything in all the worlds
      have been created only by your grace.
      What can I say to praise you?

3019. In the beginning you created Nānmuhan from your navel
      and said to him, “Create the world surrounded with oceans.”
      Even if famous Shiva and the other shining gods praise you
      they cannot do justice to your venerable and marvelous fame.
      Many devotees praise you.

3020. You are wise,
      your knowledge does not diminish or grow,
      you have a faultless body
      and you are whole and not whole.
      If Indra the king of the gods worships your feet
      won’t the brightness of your lotus feet grow dull
      because he lacks the words to praise you?

3021. Riding on Garuḍa, you appeared
      carrying a sharp-edged discus in your right hand
      to save the elephant Gajendra from the crocodile
      when he called you for help.
      When your devotees worship you with their faultless knowledge,
      do you think if you give your grace to them
      your brightness in this wide world will diminish?

3022. The lord Shiva with matted hair adorned with the crescent moon,
      Nānmuhan and Indra know you are the lord and praise you
      who are a bright light and a blooming flower.
      You are the inner meaning of the four Vedas,
      and you created this world, swallowed it and spat it out
      and measured it at Mahābali's sacrifice.
      Is this not a wonder?

3023. Saḍagopan of flourishing Thirukkuruhur
      where many famous and victorious Vediyars live
      composed a thousand faultless pāsurams
      and worshiped and praised the lord,
      the true wisdom, the giver of Vedas to the sages.
      If devotees learn and recite these ten poems
      they will not be born again in this world surrounded by roaring oceans.

3024. When will I leave this body that you gave me
      and be rid of the troubles that are the result of my karma?
      When will I join you who have the color of a cloud
      and created the world surrounded by oceans?

3025. When will the time come
      when I join you who took the form of a dwarf
      and measured the world
      and worship your wonderful divine feet,
      free from the fruits of my old karma?
      I suffer in many births because of your many māyas.

3026. O father,
      tell me the way to remove the bad karma
      that I have collected in many births
      and show me the path to reach you
      who drove the chariot for Arjuna
      and destroyed all the armies on the battlefield.

3027. You are the bright light of wisdom
      that spreads everywhere in both good and bad places.
      O my father, give me your grace so I may
      be freed from the desires of this world
      and join your feet, living the good life of serving you.

3028. You, with the lovely color of a kāyām blossom, are my father.
      Even though it seems you entered my heart,
      you have not helped the confusion of my mind.
      If this is what you do how can I come and join you?

3029. I have not thought of what is good or bad to do—
      I have done things that are wrong and enjoyed them
      without thinking of you ever. O highest one,
      creator of thousands and thousands of lives,
      when will the time come when I can attain your golden shining feet?

3030. O heart, we lived on this earth
      and never knew what true wisdom is,
      collecting bad karma that plunged us into births.
      When can we reach Kaṇṇan, the true wisdom,
      the bright light that spreads everywhere and always?

3031. I have not stopped doing bad things,
      and I have not constantly worshiped your ankleted feet,
      You, Kaṇṇan, praised from ancient times,are my bright divine light.
      I am calling you to see you. Where are you?
      I will come there and call you.

3032. You grazed the cows and protected them
      and measured the world at Mahābali's sacrifice.
      For many ages I have not known the good paths of life—
      confused, I, have continued to do bad things.
      I have been calling and calling you.
      When will I see you, my father?

3033. When the messengers of Yama come and throw out their snares,
      I will find and worship him
      who is known to all through the wise sastras
      and he will come and remove all the suffering they bring.
      I will see Kaṇṇan, the knowledge of all arts,
      and be saved as my life joins its true soul.

3034. Saḍagopan of southern Thirukkuruhur
      where cuckoo birds sing in the groves
      composed a thousand faultless musical pāsurams
      on him who contains all the souls of the world inside himself.
      If devotees learn and recite these ten pāsurams
      they will not suffer from the desires of their senses
      because that will remove the suffering that the senses give.

3035. We should join the father of the father of my father
      who is a bright beautiful light
      staying in the Thiruvenkaṭam hills
      where resounding waterfalls descend
      and do faultless service for him as slaves as long as we live.

3036. The gods in the sky and Indra the king of gods
      come and worship the dark cloud-colored lord of everlasting fame
      who, protecting my family for seven generations,
      stays in Thiruvenkaṭam where beautiful flowers bloom.

3037. Māyan, the highest ancient one of limitless fame,
      the god of the gods in the sky with lovely lotus eyes,
      a mouth red as a sweet fruit, shining like a dark jewel
      stays in the Thiruvenkaṭam hills
      where springs are filled with clear water.

3038. If I say he is the god of the gods in the sky
      that is hardly great praise for him, the lord of Thiruvenkaṭam.
      I am a mean person, without goodness,
      yet he gave me his love even though
      I have given nothing back to him, the divine shining light.

3039. Is it enough praise for him
      who is nectar for skilled Vediyars and the creator of the Vedas
      who stays in the Thiruvenkaṭam hills of faultless fame
      if I say that he is a bright light
      and the ancient lord worshiped by all the worlds?

3040. Because the devotees who live in the Thiruvenkaṭam hills
      perform service to the devotees of our lord,
      doing only good for others, it is our duty to worship them
      even if they suffer in their lives because of their bad karma.

3041. The gods in the sky and the king of gods Indra
      go to the Thiruvenkaṭam hills carrying beautiful flowers,
      water, lamps and incense to worship the lord.
      If we go there, that majestic hill will give us moksha.

3042. If we go to the divine Thiruvenkaṭam hills
      where the mighty lord stays,
      the highest one who measured the world
      and carried Govardhana mountain
      to protect the cows from the cold storm,
      and if we worship him, just that will remove our karma.

3043. If devotees worship his lotus feet
      keeping him in their minds
      and praising him with their tongues,
      the lord of divine Thiruvenkatam,
      the cowherd, will take away their old age
      when they grow weary and sick
      and remove their future births.

3044. Before you become old and weak
      and the end of your days comes,
      go to Thiruvenkaṭam, precious as gold,
      surrounded with groves
      blooming with flowers that swarm with bees.
      See the lord who rests on a snake bed,
      and worship his divine feet.

3045. Saḍagopan of Thirukuruhur surrounded by flourishing groves
      composed a thousand faultless pāsurams
      praising the lord who measured the earth with his feet.
      If devotees learn and recite these ten poems
      they will live with fame on this earth
      and the world will praise them.

3046. Should I say that you have matchless fame,
      or that you are the beautiful one unequalled on the earth?
      Should I say you shine in the cool ocean,
      or that you are hot fire?
      Should I say you are wind
      or that you are the sky that covers the earth?
      Should I say you are the sun and the moon
      or that you are the everlasting one? What can I call you?

3047. I do not know what to call you.
      Should I say you are a mountain
      or that you are the rain that nourishes the world?
      Should I say you are the shining stars or the arts?
      Should I say you are wisdom?
      You are the lotus-eyed Kaṇṇan praised by the whole world.

3048. Should I say you are the lotus-eyed lord
      or that you have a mouth red as coral?
      Should I say you are the shining sun
      or that you have the dark color of kohl?
      Should I say you embrace Lakshmi on your chest
      or that you carry a conch and a discus in your hands?
      You are a precious diamond.

3049. Should I say you are a precious ruby
      or that you are pure gold?
      Should I say you are the best pearl from the ocean
      or that you are a faultless diamond?
      Should I say you are a faultless beautiful lamp
      or that you are ancient brightness?
      Should I say you are the ancient one of the world?
      You are my everlasting father, Achudan, the pure one.

3050. Should I say you are Achudan, the pure one
      or that you are the remedy for the karma of your devotees?
      Should I say you are the nectar that came from the milky ocean
      or that you are sweet jaggery?
      Should I say you are food with its six tastes
      or that you are the taste of ghee?
      Are you the taste of honey? Are you the taste of fruit or milk?

3051. Should I say you are milk or the fruit of the Vedas?
      Should I say you are the moral and religious books
      or that you are the music that I love to hear?
      Should I say you are a precious thing above all these
      or that you are the result of karma?
      Should I say you are Kaṇṇanor that you are Maal?
      Should I say you are Māyan? You are the ancient one..

3052. Should I say you are the chief of the gods
      or that you are the lord of the gods in the sky?
      Should I say you are the joy of the gods in the sky
      or that you yourself are all the gods?
      Should I say you are faultless wealth or that you are faultless heaven?
      Should I say you, colored like a bright sapphire, are faultless moksha?

3053. Should I say you have the color of bright sapphire
      or that you are Shiva with the moon in his matted hair
      who is praised by his devotees as the unique one?
      Should I say you are Nānmuhan?
      You are my father adorned with flowers and thulasi garlands.
      You are Kaṇṇan and Māyan
      and you created all the worlds through your grace
      and the world praises you.

3054. I do not know how to worship him,
      the Kaṇṇan, the Māyan, the god with no end,
      the Achudan who churned the milky ocean
      and took the nectar from it,
      the lord who rests on Adishesha in deep yoga
      the Maal who swallowed the world and spit it out.
      He is all things and he is everyone in the world.

3055. He is all things and all creatures and in their feelings,
      abiding in all people whenever they are in need.
      All the five senses do not know him who never grows weary.
      The soul has no desires and if someone understands his own soul,
      he will join him because the lord himself is the soul.

3056. Saḍagopan the generous poet of Thirukkuruhur
      composed a thousand pāsurams on the cloud-colored lord
      adorned with cool garlands that swarm with bees.
      If devotees learn and recite these ten pāsurams,
      surrounded by the gods, they will enjoy the pleasures of moksha.

3057. The dark cloud-colored Kaṇṇan
      gave his grace to the elephant Gajendra
      when it was caught by a crocodile in a pond
      in a grove blooming with flowers that swarmed with bees.
      What is the use of those who do not get up, dance, jump,
      praise and sing the greatness of our lord?
      Tell me, O devotees living in this world surrounded by the cool ocean.

3058. Thirumāl destroyed the strong Asurans,
      who, wearing heroic anklets, killed the people of the world
      surrounded by oceans and ate them.
      If you do not bathe, sing, dance, and praise Thirumāl,
      you will be born on the earth again and suffer
      because you have collected bad karma.

3059. He carried Govardhana mountain
      and protected the cows from their affliction.
      Those who do not jump and dance,
      roll on the ground, and praise always the dear lord
      will go to hell and suffer.

3060. The lord Sridharan who has a beautiful pearl-like mouth,
      killed seven strong bulls to marry Nappinnai
      whose hair was adorned with fragrant flowers.
      What is the use of those who are born as sages
      if they, not singing, dancing, kneeling and bowing their heads,
      wander about without praising the lord?

3061. The ancient lord shining in the sky
      left his divine form in heaven and was born on the earth
      to defeat Kamsan when he afflicted the sages.
      What can people do if they do not sing, praise, dance and worship him
      before the sages, the learned of all the sastras?

3062. The lord who rests on the ocean, sweet as a fruit, sugarcane juice,
      jaggery, honey and nectar, matchless and without birth,
      was born on this earth to save his devotees.
      If all creatures born in various forms as humans, animals and others
      worship him with songs and dance without ever growing tired
      they will receive the wisdom of understanding all things.

3063. If people merely eat well and get fat, never thinking of him,
      what can they do to the good devotees
      who worship the lord with tears,
      melting in their hearts with devotion for him
      who gave his grace to the five Pandavas
      and destroyed the hundred evil Kauravas.

3064. Our father stays in the northern Thiruvenkaṭam hills
      where flourishing cool waterfalls descend with abundant water.
      Devotees who repeat his many names
      and wander everywhere and dance
      while the people of the world mock them
      and laugh at them saying they are crazy
      will be worshiped by the gods in the sky.

3065. Even if devotees do yoga and think in their minds,
      that their soul and he are the same
      they will not be able to join him,
      but those who, without expecting any benefit,
      think only of the highest lord of the whole world
      worshiped by the gods in the sky
      and who sing, dance and prattle his names will join him.

3066. O devotees, think of the lovely-eyed sapphire-colored Maal,
      the cause of everything who is our actions and the result of our actions
      and the lord of the gods.
      Banishing ignorance, keeping him in your mind
      and melting in your hearts, dance, prattle on and praise him
      without holding back and without being proud.

3067. Saḍagopan from cool flourishing Thirukkuruhur
      surrounded with good fields
      composed a thousand pāsurams praising the famous lord Achudan,
      the father of the gods in the sky,
      the lord who takes away the evil nature of his devotees,
      removes their desires and makes them serve him.
      If devotees learn these ten pāsurams and recite them,
      their bad karma will go away.

3068. Beautiful lotus-eyed Kaṇṇan surrounded with bright light
      is shining wisdom and the three gods, Nānmuhan, Shiva and Indra.
      He swallowed all the seven worlds
      and spat out the earth, sky, people, gods
      and all other things and created this world again.

3069. Worship the lotus-eyed Kaṇṇan,
      the destroyer of all the sins of his devotees
      who is the most ancient of all the three gods
      and who, as Rama, carried a victorious bow,
      burned Lanka in the south and destroyed the Rakshasas.
      He, the god of the gods, rests on the wide ocean
      and removes the curse of all.

3070. The highest one, the divine light,
      the handsome young lord colored sapphire blue
      and praised by the gods in the sky,
      danced the kuravai dance on a pot
      and rests on Adishesha on the ocean.
      Praise him in your mind night and day without ceasing.

3071. I and others like me tell you,
      “Keep Māyavan and his grace in your mind and worship him.”
      How can we describe his greatness?
      Even Indra the king of the gods,
      Nānmuhan and Shiva the great one his matted hair
      think of his lotus feet as they wander about,
      praising and worshiping him always.

3072. Dark-colored Kaṇṇan, the god of the gods with lotus eyes
      and curly hair that wears a shining crown,
      is the wind that blows, the wide sky,
      the mighty earth, the oceans surrounding the earth,
      fire that burns, the sun and moon and all creatures of the world.

3073. Though he has no beginning or end
      he owns everything that has a beginning and end.
      He came as an angry man-lion, killed Hiraṇyan
      and gave his grace to his son Prahaladan who worshiped his feet.
      The lovely-eyed Maal
      is the smell, form, taste, touch and sound of the world
      and a bull among the gods in the sky.
      I will not have any other as my refuge
      for all my seven births except him.

3074. If you worship with a pure heart the sapphire-colored lord
      who dances the Kuḍakuthu
      and is sweet nectar, the shining light that embraces my dear life
      and the sweet fruit tasted by the gods and sages,
      your troubles will not be with you even for a moment.

3075. I have no refuge except the son of Dasaratha,
      who is the karma that gives pleasures and sorrows to all,
      yet is neither pleasure nor sorrow,
      the imperishable, the light that shines on high.
      He swallowed all the seven worlds and spit them out
      and he is poison for the messengers of Yama
      who come to take people’s lives.

3076. He, more ancient than the three gods
      Indra, Nānmuhan and Shiva,
      is my father, my mother and my refuge.
      He is everything, yet he is not everything.
      O people of the world, do not be afraid and worry, saying,
      “He is this one or he is that one.”
      The ocean-colored god will take whatever form you think of
      when you contemplate him in your heart.

3077. When will my eyes see the feet
      adorned with sounding anklets
      of the ocean-colored Kaṇṇan,
      my dear life, a diamond for the gods in the sky,
      the highest light that rests on a snake bed
      who rode the chariot for Arjuna in the terrible war
      when the Pandavas could not fight and gave them the victory.

3078. Saḍagopan, the chief of Thirukuruhur,
      a part of the fertile country of the Pandiyan king
      surrounded with groves that swarm with bees,
      composed a thousand pāsurams with music
      on the god of gods in the sky who is hard for the eyes to see
      and easy for the mind to understand..
      If devotees learn these ten pāsurams and recite them
      they will become the devotees of Kaṇṇan
      who gives grace to all creatures of the world.

3079. Those who have the fortune of being the devotees
      of the highest, beautiful lotus-eyed lord, the shining bright light
      who rests on the sweet milky ocean
      will be my lords in all my births and they will rule me

3080. He, Kaṇṇan, the highest, the lord of the world,
      our father with four arms and the color of a pure sapphire rules us all.
      The devotees who worship folding their hands before my dear lord's feet
      are my masters and I will serve them in all my births.

3081. He, my dear father who is wise and carries a golden discus,
      is adorned with fragrant thulasi garlands
      and is praised by the world and the sky.
      See, the devotees who worship the feet of the lord
      are my masters and I will serve them in all my births.

3082. He wears precious garments,
      a lovely necklace on his neck,
      a golden thread around his waist, and a golden crown on his head
      and many ornaments on his body.
      See, the devotees of the devotees of divine Nāraṇan
      are lords for me in all my births.

3083. Our father, the lord of good devotees
      gave nectar to the gods so their troubles would go away.
      The devotees who prattle on praising other devotees
      who prattle on praising our god will protect us in this birth
      and in all future births.

3084. Kaṇṇan, our father, the highest of all the gods,
      colored like a pure sapphire, gives us his grace,
      shines like a bright light, carries a discus,
      and is adorned with a fragrant thulasi garland.
      Those devotees who worship him in their hearts
      will take care of us without ever tiring
      and protect us in this birth and in all our future births.

3085. Our father gives his grace to his devotees
      so they will not be born again, bringing them to moksha
      and keeping them beneath his feet so they can worship him.
      I worship the devotees who praise his devotees—
      they are my friends who will protect me and forgive all my faults.

3086.The lord who created the world
and embraces on his chest the goddess of wealth is our friend.
Even the gods in the sky do not understand him.
In all our births, we will worship even those
who stay in the most sinful hell if they praise him.

3087. Even those who were born in castes lower than the four varnas,
      those who are Chandalas without the respect of others,
      are gods for me if they are the devotees of his devotees
      and if they keep in their hearts the highest sapphire-colored one
      with a discus in his right hand.

3088. We are the devotees of the devotees of the devotees
      of the devotees of the devotees
      of our father, the faultless one,
      who swallowed the world as a dear child
      and slept on a banyan leaf
      and measured the world as a dwarf.

3089. Saḍagopan of southern Thirukuruhur
      composed a thousand pāsurams on him, the highest,
      who destroyed the hundred Kauravas
      and gave his grace to the five Pandavas.
      If you learn these ten poems that praise his devotees,
      you will not be born again.

3090. My heart always praises you saying,
      “All the three worlds worship you who wear a crown.
      and praise the fame of your feet that measured the world.
      You churned the deep milky ocean
      and ride an eagle carrying an eagle banner.
      You, colored like a cloud,
      are the tallest among all the gods in heaven.”

3091. My mouth always praises you, saying,
      “You, the poison that burned cool Lanka,
      the dwarf who cheated Mahābali
      and took the earth from him,
      are my refuge and you stay in my heart.”

3092. My arms want to embrace you,
      who removed the curse of the crescent moon,
      the lord of the gods in the sky praised by the sastras,
      the sweet child of a cowherd who stole butter from the huts of the cowherds.

3093. My eyes want to see you truly,
      the highest one resting on the snake bed Adisesha
      as I worship and embrace you every day
      and every minute with my arms without leaving you.

3094. My eyes want to see him as he was
      when he went as a dwarf to Mahābali to take over the earth
      riding on the eagle Garuda.
      My ears want to hear the noise of the wings
      of Garuḍa that sound like the singing of the Sama Veda.

3095. O lord, with a golden discus who stay in this world,
      I want to recite the poems that are sweet as fruit and honey
      which I composed to praise your fame as my heart praises you. Give me your grace.

3096. You, sweet nectar, are my soul,
      my ruler riding on the eagle Garuda
      carrying a shining discus. I am a sinner.
      Even though I have called for you a long time,
      saying that I want see you, suffering in my heart,
      I cannot see your form.

3097. O lovely lord who are the past, present and future,
      when will the day come that I see you,
      the lotus-eyed lord with a beautiful body dark as kohl
      whose beautiful nature attracts my soul?

3098.When will the time come that I join you,
the mighty god riding on an eagle?
You are a thief who cheated Mahābali
when you went to him as a dwarf and asked him,
“O Mahābali, give me three feet of your land and I will take it,”
and you deceived Kamsan and destroyed the valor of Vāṇasuran
and cut off his thousand arms.

3099. O generous one,
      when two Asurans came as large marudam trees,
      you went between them and destroyed them.
      How long can I sing and praise you,
      prattling on with my garlands of words
      and staying forever in this world,
      longing to see your ankleted feet?

3100. Saḍagopan of flourishing Thirukuruhur
      composed a thousand poems on the lord
      who measured the world
      and whom all creatures prattle on in their desire to see.
      If devotees learn and recite these ten poems
      they will reach the highest heaven.

3101. If I say this it may be a mistake,
      but I will still say it, listen.
      I won’t give anyone any of the sweet poems
      that I composed myself for the lord.
      In my poems I will only praise my dear father
      of Srirangam where the bees sing, “tenna, tenna.”
      This I promise.

3102. What is the benefit of composing poems on people
      who only respect wealth
      and think it is the only important thing in life?
      They don’t understand that the only true thing in the world
      is our dear lord, our father who stays in Thirukkurunguḍi
      with abundant ponds and with flourishing fields.

3103. O poets, why do you compose
      wonderful poems on common people
      and make yourself cheap
      without praising the lord of the sky
      who shows you the way to reach moksha
      age after age unceasingly?


3104. O poets, think!
      People do not live forever.
      How long will the wealth last that you receive
      composing poems praising them?
      If you praise and sing the greatness of the father of the gods in the sky
      who is adorned with a shining diamond crown,
      he will accept you as his devotee
      and give you his grace so you will not be born again.

3105. O poets, you praise wicked people to get their corrupt wealth
      and lose your integrity. This is a useless thing to do.
      The faultless, generous lord who has the color of sapphire
      will give you whatever you want.
      However much wealth he gives, it will never become less.
      Come, compose pāsurams praising the generous lord..

3106. O poets, come. You work hard and live
      and you know the rich will not be rich always.
      If you compose wonderful poems on the gods you like,
      still your words will go to Thirumāl,
      adorned with a shining beautiful crown.

3107. There is no limit to the generosity and fame
      of the god praised with a thousand names—
      I will not praise anyone but him.
      If anyone in this world praises a miser saying,
      “You are as generous as the rain
      and your arms are strong as mountains,” that is just a lie.

3108. I will sing his praise and worship
      the feet of the lord of boundless fame,
      the beloved of Nappinnai with beautiful bamboo-like arms.
      What can I say to the people who believe in this illusory world
      and do not put their minds on god?

3109. I praise only the generous lord with a discus
      who grazes the cows and belongs to me.
      Saying, “I will give you a happy life in this world
      and you will attain moksha,” he grants me moksha.
      I do not want to praise any people in my poems.

3110. He made this body that stays for many days
      and after it leaves it returns to the world, taking many births.
      I want only to praise him and compose poems about him—
      will he accept poems composed by anyone but me?

3111. Saḍagopan of Thirukuruhur, praised by all,
      composed a thousand pāsurams on the lord
      who is worshiped by all the gods in the sky.
      If devotees learn these ten famous pāsurams
      and know them well they will not be born again in this world.

3112. Carrying a conch, discus, bow, shining sword and a strong club
      and riding on an eagle, he came to the earth in many forms,
      fought with the strong Asurans, killed them in battle
      and saved the earth from its trials.
      I am his devotee and, praising him,
      I will not have any difficulty in my life.

3113. The bright, sapphire-colored Kaṇṇan
      who conquered the Asurans riding on dark-beaked Garuda
      rests closing his beautiful lotus eyes
      as if he were performing yoga
      on the snake bed Adisesha on the faultless wide ocean.
      Praising his divine fame and singing and dancing,
      I will have no trouble in my life.

3114. The lord is endless joy,
      as sweet as jaggery, honey, nectar, good milk, fruit and sugarcane—
      no one is better than he or equal to him
      who wears a cool beautiful thulasi garland in his hair that drips with honey.
      Since I became his slave my mind has never been apart from him.

3115. Along with Shiva, the destroyer of three forts,
      his son Karthikeya and Agni, Vaṇasuran came to fight
      with the lord who carries a golden discus
      and rides on Garuḍa that fights with his wings,
      and when the Asuran and his helpers lost and fled,
      the Māyavan gave protection to Vāṇāsuran.
      I have embraced the cowherd, the lion, Achudan who carries a golden discus
      and I will have no trouble in my life.

3116. The lord who shines like a bright light
      drove his chariot and went to heaven
      without any difficulties, crossing over all the worlds with famous Arjuna
      and a Brahmin who had lost his children,
      and he brought the Brahmin’s children back to earth in one day.
      No trouble will come to me, his slave, in this world.

3117. The Māyan, the highest lord,
      has no sorrow, only excellence
      that shines like an undimming bright light.
      He came to the earth as a man and experienced sorrowful births.
      Worshiping him who gives divine grace to the earth,
      I will never know trouble.

3118. The lord who is sorrow and happiness,
      all the actions of the world,
      all the things on the earth,
      cruel hell that has no joy,
      good, sweet moksha in the sky,
      and all the creatures that survive on this earth
      plays with this whole illusory world and enjoys himself.
      I am his devotee and I will never know trouble.

3119. Our lord, Māyan, Kaṇṇan
      who is joy without any sorrow,
      unlimited beauty and bright light,
      limitless wisdom, our mother,
      does all the illusionary actions of the world.
      I worship his feet and I will never know any trouble.

3120. Our strong lord adorned with thulasi garlands
      the bright shining form of wisdom,
      our almighty who took many forms and did many magical deeds
      is without sorrow.
      He swallowed all the seven worlds,
      Shiva who laughs, Nānmuhan,
      and all the other gods and people and all creatures
      and he keeps them inside himself.
      I am his slave and I will have no difficulty in my life.

3121.Our shining Māyan, Kaṇṇan,
unique and omnipresent, wise, tireless, formless,
the moon and the sun,
light that spreads everywhere
and the five elements of earth, water, fire, sky and wind
cannot be known by the five senses.
I worship his feet and I will never have troubles.

3122. Saḍagopan of Thirukuruhur
      composed a thousand poems on the famous Kesavan,
      the faultless lord.
      O devotees, learn and recite these ten poems
      and he will give you cities, countries, chariots and moksha
      and make you the kings of all the three worlds.

3123. If the matchless kings who rule this world
      lose a war with their enemies, they will become beggars,
      and when they beg for food wicked dogs will come and grab their begging pots.
      The only way to escape from the troubles of this world
      is to worship the feet of divine Narayaṇan.

3124. The rich kings who ruled this earth
      and ordered other chieftains,
      “Give tribute and survive!”
      will leave the women they enjoyed,
      go to a cruel forest and hide and suffer
      if their enemies conquer them in war and take their lands.
      You should at once worship the feet of Thirumāl
      adorned with beautiful shining crowns—
      that is the only way to escape the troubles of this world.

3125. The kings whom chieftains bow to, touching their feet,
      and the kings who have drums that sound like thunder
      resting in their courtyards,
      may lose everything and their lands may become dust.
      At once you should think of the feet of Kaṇṇan
      adorned with a fragrant thulasi garland and worship him.
      That is the only way to escape the troubles of this world.

3126. We know that even the kings
      who ruled this world for many years and yugas
      and are more than the grains of sand on the seashore
      have perished, leaving them no house to live in.
      We have never seen anything else happen to them.
      Worship his feet who killed the rutting elephant
      with legs as strong as palm trees and you will be saved.

3127. Even kings who enjoy women with soft beautiful hair
      lying on lovely, cool beds, begging them,
      “Give us your grace!” may lose all their wealth and their clothes
      and wander as women shame them because they become poor.
      Praise the names of Māyavan
      the shining sapphire-colored lord and survive.
      That is the only way to escape the troubles of this world.

3128. We all know that we do not live forever in this world
      and die like the bubbles that arise when rain falls on the earth.
      No one can say that for all their life
      they were strong, without problems or sickness.
      If you want to survive, become the devotee
      of the highest lord who rests on the ocean.

3129. The rich may eat food with all the six tastes
      and then eat more when their beautiful beloved women
      serve them with lovely soft words,
      yet even they may become poor and beg those women saying,
      “Give me some food!”
      If you want to be saved
      praise the wonderful nature of the lord
      whose head is adorned with a thulasi garland.

3130. If the generous kings who rule the world happily
      as people praise them abundantly do not think of the lord,
      they will lose all their wealth and kingdoms.
      The only way to escape the troubles of this world
      is to praise the divine names
      of the lord who rests on the snake bed on the ocean.

3131. Even though people may go to heaven
      if they have renounced the desires of this world
      and the wealth of the earth, controlling the desires of their five senses,
      ignoring their bodies and doing tapas,
      they will be born again on the earth if they do not think
      of the highest one with an eagle banner.
      If you do not want to be born again, worship his feet
      and you will reach his heaven, Vaikuṇṭam.

3132. Sages may control all their desires for the world
      and think only of moksha, but they will not attain Vaikuṇṭam
      unless they worship the faultless lord and hold to him.
      They may think of him with love but that will not give them his grace
      or let them not be born again.
      Moksha is to approach him, the faultless one,
      and to grasp him without leaving him.

3133. Saḍagopan of Thirukkuruhur
      surrounded by blooming clusters of flowers
      composed a thousand beautiful poems
      worshiping the feet of Kaṇṇan.
      If devotees learn and recite these ten songs
      they will survive on this earth without troubles
      and reach Vaikuṇṭam.

3134. Her mother says,
      “He swallowed all the seven worlds
      and slept on a banyan leaf without any worries
      when he was a baby.
      My innocent vine-like daughter
      is fascinated with the thulasi garland
      that adorns his two feet and wants it—
      how can she get it? Surely, I must have bad karma.
      What can I do to make my daughter happy?”

3135. Her mother says,
      “The lord dances the kuravai dance
      with cowherd girls with thin vine-like waists
      and plays mischievously with them.
      My beautiful doll-like daughter
      says that she wants the fragrant pretty thulasi garland
      that adorns his divine feet.
      I have done bad karma
      and do not realize that he is the almighty
      and his garland is not easy to get.
      What can I do?”

3136. Her mother says,
      “He measured the world with his feet
      as the gods and the wise sages worshiped him,
      chanting the Vedas and adorning him with many fresh garlands.
      My daughter, wearing a garland in her hair,
      worries and says, ‘Get me the pure thulasi garland
      precious as gold that adorns the divine feet of the highest lord.’
      I have done bad karma to see my daughter worry like this.
      What can I do?”

3137. Her mother says,
      “My daughter who has beautiful round arms says always,
      ‘Bring me the fresh thulasi garland
      precious as gold on the feet of the highest lord
      whose devotees praise his faultless fame,
      prattling on about the many differences that other religions have.’
      I have done bad karma. What can I do?”

3138. Her mother says,
      “My lovely daughter worries every day and says,
      ‘He fought and conquered seven bulls
      for the sake of embracing the arms of Nappinnai.
      He grazes the cows and he dances the Kudakuthu dance.
      Bring me the beautiful fresh thulasi garland on the feet of the lord.’”

3139. Her mother says,
      “My lovely daughter has fallen in love with him and says always,
      ‘When an Asuran took the beautiful earth goddess and hid her,
      the lord in ancient times took the form of a boar,
      split open the wide earth and brought her back.
      Bring me the fresh thulasi garland as precious as gold on the feet of the lord.’”

3140. Her mother says,
      “The lord keeps beautiful Lakshmi on a lotus
      on his wide chest that is adorned with thulasi garlands.
      My daughter lovely as a vine is fascinated with him
      and longs for the fresh thulasi garland on his feet.
      O girls with shining foreheads, see my beautiful daughter!”

3141. Her mother says,
      “My daughter longs for the fresh beautiful thulasi garland
      that spreads fragrance and adorns the feet
      of him who shot his arrows and burnt Lanka for his wife Sita, beautiful as a vine.
      O lovely girls, I am worried. What can I do?”

3142. Her mother says,
      “O friends, you have also have given birth to daughters.
      What can I say about the innocent one that I gave birth to?
      Night and day, she says, ‘Conch, discus, thulasi garland.’
      This is all she says—what can I do?”

3143. Her mother says, “What can I do?
      She is my innocent daughter, my precious jewel.
      Whatever I say, she doesn’t listen.
      She doesn’t come near me either.
      O friends, she says, ‘He is adorned with shining ornaments.
      I want the thulasi garland on the feet of Kaṇṇan
      to wear on my soft breasts ornamented with golden jewels.’”

3144. Saḍagopan of famous and rich Thirukkuruhur
      composed a thousand musical pāsurams praising Kaṇṇan’s feet
      that remove the sicknesses that afflict people.
      If devotees learn and recite these ten pāsurams
      they will join the group of gods in the sky.

3145. Even though I do not sprinkle flowers and water
      on your feet and worship you, my heart is the sandal paste
      that I smear on your soft flower-like body.
      You fought with seven bulls
      to marry Nappinnai whose mouth is red as a kovai fruit,
      your bow destroyed the king Ravana of Lanka surrounded with strong forts
      and you broke the tusks of the strong elephant Kuvalayabeeḍam.

3146. O my father,
      you are the matchless lord who swallowed the earth and spit it out
      My heart is the sandal paste that I smear on you,
      my words are the garland with which I decorate you,
      my poems are the silk clothes for you
      and the way I fold my hands and worship you
      are the shining ornaments for you.
      You are the matchless lord
      who swallowed the earth and spit it out

3147. O Narayaṇa! You are only god,
      the two gods—the sun and the moon.
      the three gods—Shiva, Vishnu and Nānmuhan and all the gods,
      and you are the five elements—water, fire, wind, earth and sky.
      Though you are formless you rest on the middle of the ocean
      and you climbed on the heads of Kalingan and danced.
      I keep you in my heart and all my troubles have gone away.

3148. You are the Māyan
      who drank the devil Putana’s milk and killed her,
      you are Vamanan and you are Madhavan.
      Even if I do not worship you with cool flower garlands,
      my life is the cool beautiful garland
      that I give you to adorn your tall crown.

3149. My life is the garland that adorns you
      and my love is a golden light for you.
      Your crown, countless ornaments and beautiful clothes
      are all only my love
      and the praises that all the people of the three worlds utter
      are my devotion for you.
      You are our dear god Kaṇṇan with a discus in your hands.
      Give your grace to the world.

3150. Even though you do not come when I shout out,
      calling you and saying,
      “O Narayana! You have a discus and a white conch in your hands,
      and you swallowed the world and spit it out!”
      I keep the beautiful sounding anklets that you wear on your lotus feet
      as an ornament on my head.

3151. As a beautiful dwarf you went to Mahābali's sacrifice,
      grew tall and measured the worlds with your long strides.
      When devotees fold their hands
      and worship your feet ornamented with sounding anklets,
      you the Māyavan are with them.
      Even though I do not worship you with water and fragrant flowers,
      your divine shining form that is praised by the Vedas is in my heart.

3152. Your form is the light of knowledge
      that shines over all the seven wonderful worlds.
      My soul is yours and your soul is mine.
      How can I describe you and tell what your nature is?

3153. You are the highest one,
      the divine light without any falsehood.
      When will I reach the shores of the flood of your unlimited fame?
      I am filled with love for you but I cannot describe you.
      All good devotees praise you loudly and I praise you with them..

3154. I praise him and all the seven worlds praise him,
      yet even if all praise him
      they do not utter enough words to praise his limitless fame.
      I praise him because he is as sweet as honey,
      milk, jaggery, and nectar for me, and I will be saved.

3155. Saḍagopan of Thirukkuruhur of the southern kingdom
      surrounded by fields blooming with beautiful lotuses,
      realizing that the only way to be saved is to worship his feet,
      composed a thousand faultless pāsurams
      praising his feet adorned with shining anklets.
      If devotees learn and recite these ten poems
      they will stay in this world happily and rule heaven.

3156. Her mother says,
      “My daughter fell in love with the lord.
      She touches the earth and says,
      ‘This earth was measured by Vamanan.’
      She points her finger at the sky and says,
      ‘That is Vaikuṇṭam.’
      As she thinks of Kaṇṇan her eyes fill with tears
      and she says, ‘He has the color of the ocean.’
      O lord, you have fascinated my daughter.
      O girls ornamented with bangles! What can I do?”

3157. Her mother says,
      “My daughter folds her bangled hands and says,
      ‘He is our beloved and he rests on this ocean.’
      She points to the red sun and says,
      ‘This is a form of Sridharan.’
      She stands sorrowfully, her eyes filled with tears,
      and says, ‘Nāraṇan!’
      O lord, she, soft like a small doe, looks divine.
      I don’t know what to do.”

3158. Her mother says,
      “My daughter who has the fragrance of a thulasi garland
      looks at the red fire and says, ‘He is indestructible.’
      She embraces the strong wind and says, ‘This is my Govindan.’
      I have done bad karma.
      My little doe-like bangled girl does so many things,
      but I can’t understand even one of them.”

3159. Her mother says,
      “My daughter points to the shining moon and says,
      ‘That is the bright sapphire-colored one.’
      She looks at the tall hills and calls out loudly,
      ‘O Neḍumāl, come!’
      If the rain pours down, she says,
      ‘O Naraṇan come!’ and dances.
      In so many ways he has fascinated
      my beautiful daughter, as precious as a jewel.”

3160. Her mother says,
      “My daughter embraces calves
      and says that Govindan grazes them.
      She runs behind a slithering snake and says,
      ‘This is his bed.’
      I don’t know when this trouble will end.
      I have done bad karma.
      The mischievous Māyon has fascinated my beautiful daughter—what can I do?”

3161. Her mother says,
      “If a dancer carries a pot,
      my daughter runs and says, ‘Govindan is there.’
      If she hears the melodious sound of a flute,
      she is fascinated and says, ‘Māyavan is playing the flute.’
      If she sees butter that the cowherd women have churned,
      she says, ‘This is the butter that he has eaten.’
      He drank the poisonous milk from the devil Putana—
      how could my lovely vine-like daughter be so crazy about him?”

3162. Her mother says,
      “Like a crazy person, my daughter says,
      ‘All the worlds were created by Kaṇṇan.’
      If she sees people wearing a nāmam,
      she runs near them and says,
      ‘Here are the devotees of Neḍumāl.’
      If she sees a fragrant thulasi garland with flowers,
      she says, ‘These are the garlands of Nāraṇan.’
      Whether she is in a state of knowing everything,
      or in a state of knowing nothing,
      my precious girl loves the ornamented feet of Māyon.”

3163. Her mother says,
      “If she sees famous kings,
      my daughter says, ‘I have seen Thirumāl.’
      If she sees something blue, she jumps and says,
      ‘He is Thirumāl and he measured the world.’
      If she sees divine temples, she says,
      ‘These are the temples of the ocean-colored one.’
      Whether she is afraid of something or just stricken with love,
      she wants the ankleted feet of Kaṇṇan.”

3164. Her mother says,
      “If my daughter sees sages
      she says that they are forms of him
      who swallowed all the worlds.
      If she sees large dark clouds she jumps and says,
      ‘They are Kaṇṇan!’ and feels very happy.
      If she sees a herd of cows grazing on the land,
      she goes behind them and says,
      ‘The dear Kaṇṇan is here!’
      Māyon has made my precious daughter crazy
      and weary with fascination and love for him.”

3165. Her mother says,
      “My daughter is fascinated with him.
      She looks for him in every direction.
      She looks into long distances to see whether he is coming.
      Thinking of him she sweats and she sighs
      and her eyes are filled with tears.
      Tired, she says, ‘O Kaṇṇan!’ and she calls him, ‘O dear lord, come!’
      I have done bad karma.
      What can I do for my innocent daughter?
      She is stricken with such ardent love!”

3166. Saḍagopan of rich Thirukkuruhur
      composed a thousand songs on Kaṇṇan
      who removes bad karma.
      If devotees learn and recite these ten songs,
      they will get good karma and go to Vaikuṇṭam
      and all in the sky will worship them.

3167. I decorate him with garlands of songs,
      the strong lord who loves me like my mother,
      the ruler of all the seven worlds with his unique scepter
      who split open the mouth of Asuran Kesi
      when he came as a horse.
      I worship him saying, “I praise you! I praise you!”—
      there will be no trouble for me in all my seven births.

3168. I keep him in my mind,
      the god of the gods in the sky
      who holds beautiful dark-eyed Lakshmi on his chest
      and I decorate him with garlands of songs
      and worship him with music.
      All the terrible sicknesses of this world
      will not come to me.

3169. Achudan, the god of the gods,
      with beautiful lotus eyes and faultless qualities
      gives endless happiness to all.
      I have praised him for endless ages
      with garlands of songs
      and received endless joy worshiping him.

3170. My father, our dear god
      who rests on the wide ocean
      and rides a beautiful soft-feathered eagle
      removes the karma of his devotees
      if they approach and worship him.
      I praised him with garlands of songs
      with my tongue and reached him.
      I do not know how my soul, the supreme soul,
      guides me in my life.

3171. The lord is my mother who showed me many good paths
      and our father, a bull among the gods in the sky,
      who taught the Vedas to the sages.
      I find joy praising my dear god with garlands of pāsurams
      and all my karma vanishes faster than a swift wind.

3172. I worship the dark-colored god of the gods in the sky
      who has big lovely eyes and a white nāmam on his forehead
      with garlands of songs of divine words.
      Is there anything I could ever have that is better
      than receiving him in my heart?

3173. I have the fortune of praising with garlands of pāsurams
      the only one god on the earth, the ruler of all the worlds,
      the matchless unequaled lord
      who protected the cows and the cowherds
      from the storm by carrying Govardhana mountain as an umbrella.
      There is nothing I do not have.

3174. I have the fortune of composing garlands of pāsurams
      on the lord whose feet are adorned with cool lotuses.
      He is the god of me, of the people of the world,
      of the gods in the sky and the joy of Lakshmi.
      Who, even in the wide sky, could be my equal?

3175. He who carries a curved conch in his handsome left hand
      and danced on a pot is the king of the sky.
      He stays in the sky with the gods,on the earth, in the underworld,
      and in all the eight directions, never leaving any of those places.
      I compose poems to praise the lord and I will never have troubles.

3176. He rests on the ocean, swallowed the earth and spat it out,
      measured the world, and split open the ground
      and brought the earth goddess from the underworld.
      He shows his form to the gods in the sky,
      and, married to Nappinnai, he has the might to rule all the worlds.
      I am fortunate that I can compose beautiful Tamil poems
      that are a flood of pleasure for his devotees.

3177. Sadagopan, the son of Kāri Māran,
      composed a thousand pāsurams on the divine lord
      of the beautiful cool Thiruvenkaṭam hills
      where the rain never fails to pour.
      If devotees worship the goddess Lakshmi
      who stays on a fragrant lotus flower
      their karma will go away.

3178. Her friends say,
      “O mothers, where can we find someone to cure the sickness
      of our beautiful friend with a shining forehead?
      We have just found out what is troubling her—
      she is fascinated with him who drove Arjuna’s chariot
      and gained victory for the five Pandavas,
      conquering the Kauravas in battle.”

3179. Her friends say,
      “ O mother, you are confused without knowing
      the reason for her sickness.
      Her suffering is not caused by the Anangu or another small goddess.
      When she was playing in the water
      she fell in love with the great one without knowing it.
      If you say, ‘conch, discus!’
      so she can hear it clearly, her sickness will go away
      and she will get better just today itself.
      This is the best remedy for her.”

3180. Her friends say,
      “O mother, Listen to what I say:
      ‘The female priest said that if we worship the Anangu
      her sickness will go away. Don’t listen to her.
      Don’t do this or that ritual, don’t offer meat and toddy.
      If you praise the ankleted feet of Māya Pirān
      whose head is garlanded with thulasi,
      that will be the best remedy for her sickness.’”

3181. Her friends say,
      “O Mother, the female priest says,
      ‘The cure for your daughter’s sickness is to offer different kinds
      of rice to the gods,’ You listen to her
      and offer black rice and red rice to the Anangu.
      What is the use of that?
      If you say the name of the highest lord
      who swallowed all the seven worlds and spat them out,
      you will cure her sickness.”

3182. Her friends say,
      “To cure the sickness of the girl with large eyes like kuvalai flowers,
      a red mouth like a kovvai fruit and a pale body,
      don’t dance with the Anangu.
      Say the divine name of him
      who killed the angry rutting elephant Kuvalayābeeḍam
      and put on her forehead the divine red powder of the highest lord
      and her sickness will go away.”

3183. Her friends say,
      “O mothers! Don’t worship the Anangu and dance all day.
      That won’t cure her sickness, it will only make it worse.
      Bring the dust of the feet of the devotees
      of the sapphire-colored god and put it on her.
      Try this. It is the only cure for your daughter,
      nothing else will help her.”

3184. Her friends say,
      “O mothers, you offer goats and liquor
      to the Anangu and worship her thinking
      that will cure your beautiful daughter.
      You dance the Thuṇangai dance until your arms hurt.
      What is the use of seeing a donkey eating his food
      and looking at his lips when you are hungry?
      Bow to the devotees of the Māyappirān who recite the Vedas well.”

3185. Her friends say,
      “O mothers, go to those who know the sastras well
      and ask for their advice.
      You should worship the divine feet of the god of gods as they tell you
      but you are not doing what they say to cure her sickness.
      It is wrong to say and do bad things.
      Drinking liquor, dancing the Anangu dance with loud music
      and beating drums is wrong and shows you are not decent.”

3186. Her friends say,
      “O mothers, you say many mean things
      and dance the Anangu dance
      as a man from a low family beats the drum,
      but I know all this is a false way of trying to cure her sickness.
      Think of the lord Kannan and bow to his ankleted feet
      and that will cure her sickness,
      and it will protect you in all your future births.”

3187. Her friends say,
      “O mothers, your daughter doesn’t think of any god except Kaṇṇan,
      but you say whatever you want and dance until your arms hurt.
      Praise the everlasting king of flourishing Dwarapati
      who is praised by all the Vedas.
      Praise him, bow to him and dance.”

3188. Saḍagopan from rich Thirukkuruhur of ancient faultless fame
      composed a thousand poems on the pure sapphire-colored god.
      If devotees learn and recite these ten poems
      sing, dance and worship the lord
      they will have no trouble in their lives.

3189. Even though I have no goodness,
      whatever I do is important.
      If all the time I live, I raise my hands above my head
      and call you loudly, saying,
      “O lord of wisdom, Nārāyaṇa, you swallowed the earth,”
      won't you come to me so I can see your beautiful body?
      Call me and give me your grace.

3190. You are a Māyan and a thief.
      If I shout night and day and call to you, saying,
      “You, the generous one, give a faultless, endless flood of joy to all.
      You took the form of a dwarf and measured the world,”
      won't you come, show yourself to me
      and give me your grace?

3191. I have done so many bad deeds
      that their results will never be exhausted.
      Even though I melt in my heart
      and call and call you loudly, saying,
      “O my father who measured the whole world,
      you are Damodharan,”
      you don’t come to me so I can see you.
      You don’t say even one word to me,
      even, “You are a sinner!”

3192. I call you and prattle on, saying,
      “O my father, you have a pure, beautiful golden body.
      Come and stand before me with your twinkling lotus eyes.”
      I am shameless and have no pride.
      What is the use of my prattling on
      and calling you, most famous one?
      Even the god of gods in the sky cannot see you.

3193. I say “O my father, you carry a strong discus.
      You, the mighty one, churned the deep milky ocean.
      Could I ever see all your four arms?”
      and my eyes fill with tears and my soul is sad.
      Pitiful, I long for you and call you saying,
      “Come at once!”

3194. You are inside my body and soul,
      and in everything outside me.
      There is nothing without you
      and you abide pervading everything.
      I know well that I have no wisdom,
      but I look and look for your presence
      and long to see you, praise you
      and ask you to come to me.
      Is this because I am foolish
      and my tongue does not know what to say?

3195. I understand you who wear fragrant thulasi garlands
      and you understand me.
      I become stronger and stronger knowing you
      the faultless one, full of wisdom.
      I keep you in my mind
      and have stopped my ignorant thinking
      that made me be born again and again. I found you.

3196. O king adorned with beautiful thulasi garlands.
      we your devotees carry flowers that bloom in all the eight directions
      sing, dance and praise you happily.
      Come so that we may fold our hands
      and worship your divine feet.
      Come so that I may see you.

3197. I have not fed the hungry or given water to the thirsty.
      I have not controlled my five senses
      or plucked flowers at the right times to worship you
      as devotees are supposed to.
      My ignorant heart loves you but I have bad karma and I am tired of it.
      I am searching for you—
      where can I find you with a discus in your hand?

3198. O highest god with a discus in your hand,
      I bow to you and my eyes are filled with tears.
      I have done bad karma, and I search for you and suffer, unable to find you.
      You are the form of wisdom and the bright light of the Vedas.
      I want to see you with my eye of knowledge and embrace you.

3199. Māṛan Saḍagopan of southern Thirukkuruhur
      lovingly composed a thousand faultless Tamil poems praising the lotus-eyed god.
      If devotees learn and recite these poems,
      dance and sing and worship the lord, they will go to Vaikuṇṭam.

3200. She says,
      “On his incomparable body he bears Shiva who rides on a bull
      and Nānmuhan whose four heads face the four directions
      while the goddess Lakshmi stays on his chest.
      He used many weapons and destroyed many clans of his Raksasa enemies.
      The beautiful pallor of my body is useless if it does not attract him.”

3201. She says,
      “The lovely gold-colored Lakshmi shining like a diamond
      stays on a lotus on his chest
      and he carries a discus in his strong hands
      that destroys the powerful weapons of his enemies, the Asurans.
      He accepts me as his devotee and makes me do his service.
      The beautiful Māyan has taken my innocent heart and it will be free of trouble.”

3202. She says,
      “Coming as a mother, the ignorant devil Putana
      gave her poisonous milk to Kaṇṇan the small wise child
      and he drank it and killed her.
      The tall Māyan, the highest, has strong mountain-like arms
      and rests on a snake bed.
      If he does not love me what is the use
      of my being a chaste woman?”

3203. She says,
      “Wanting to embrace the bamboo-like arms
      of beautiful, chaste Nappinnai,
      Kaṇṇan fought with seven bulls and killed them to marry her.
      When he was born as a cowherd
      he carried a flute and a grazing stick
      and wore an orange dress with bells tied on his waist.
      What is the use of my tender pale shoot-like body
      if Kaṇṇan does not love me?”

3204. She says,
      “When his wife Sita with a voice as sweet as a parrot’s
      and a body the color of a tender shoot
      was imprisoned in Lanka by Ravaṇa
      the god went to the Rakshasas’ Lanka as Rama,
      burned it down and brought her back.
      What is the use of my being intelligent
      when the lord adorned with a fragrant blooming thulasi garland
      gives his abundant grace to the people of the world
      surrounded by the ocean but does not love me?”

3205. She says,
      “The wise god Māl taught all the Vedas to the faultless sages,
      went to Mahābali as a small dwarf and like a thief took over all his lands.
      What is the use of my lovely shining body if it does not attract the naughty Kaṇṇan?”

3206. She says,
      “He took the faultless form of a bright lion,
      angrily split open the broad chest of Hiraṇyan and felt joy.
      He carries a conch and a discus that shines like fire
      and he has a bright sapphire-colored body.
      The god who shines forever does not love me.
      What is the use of my curved bangles?”

3207. She says,
      “He blew his loud, curved conch,
      and if his enemies did not obey him, he fought with them,
      burned their lands, conquered them
      and relieved the distress of the people of the world.
      He is praised by Shiva who is beyond the understanding of people,
      Nānmuhan and Indra the king of gods.
      If he is not attracted by my mekalai belt
      what is the use of my wearing it?”

3208. She says,
      “He who rests on Adisesha and makes the world flourish
      cut off the arms of heroic Vanasuran, the famed father of Usha
      adorned with a heavy mekalai ornament that pained her waist.
      My body is useless if he has no desire to embrace it.”

3209. She says,
      “On his body he has Shiva in whose matted hair the Ganges flows
      and he destroyed the strong Asurans cutting their bodies into pieces
      as if they were debris fallen from a mountain and then felt joy.
      What is the use of my body if he does not desire it?

3210. Saḍagopan of broad Thirukuruhur
      composed a garland of a thousand faultless pāsurams with music
      about the god who ate yogurt and butter
      and swallowed all the seven worlds where many creatures live.
      If devotees learn and recite these ten poems
      they will be saved from their terrible births
      and attain Vaikuṇṭam.

3211. What a pity.
      It is the nature of the world that our enemies should be happy
      and our relatives should suffer and be distressed.
      O god, you are compassionate.
      You churned the milky ocean for the gods.
      I worship your ankleted feet. Give me your grace
      and take me to your place so I may serve you.

3212. What a pity! It is the nature of the world
      that people lose their wealth and when they die
      their relatives fall on their bodies and cry.
      I do not know how to escape the suffering of this world.
      O father resting on a snake bed, I cry out to you.
      Think of me and come to me, your devotee, quickly
      and take me to your world and let me join your feet.

3213. I see the terrible nature of the world and cannot bear it.
      People die leaving their fame, families, friends,
      relatives, their wealth and their lovely wives
      whose hair is garlanded with flowers swarming with bees.
      O god with the color of the ocean,
      do not think of me as you did before.
      Call me and make me join your feet so I may serve you.

3214. The world’s nature is a terrible thing.
      Even if someone does not want it,
      wealth may come to him, urging him to take it,
      and then destroy him like fire.
      O generous sapphire-colored god,
      give me your grace so I may come to you
      and worship your ankleted feet.

3215. All creatures that are born, live and wander
      in this world surrounded by the water-filled oceans
      get sick, grow old and die only to be born again and suffer.
      Is there any hell worse than this?
      What is this terrible nature of the earth?
      O sapphire-colored god, give me your grace
      and take me to you. Do not refuse me.

3216. The world’s nature is a terrible thing.
      People fight with each other, imprison others, hurt them
      and even kill them, not thinking it is not right
      or dharmic to do such deeds.
      O lord, adorned with fragrant thulasi,
      I am your slave and have done bad karma.
      You are sweet nectar to me.
      Call me to you and give me your grace.

3217. In the world, all the things that do not move
      and those that move are you who are my mother,
      yet you are not any of those things and you stand alone.
      Do not make me stay in this cruel world
      that gives sickness, old age, birth, death and many sorrows.
      Call me, your slave, to your place and keep me with you.

3218. You created this large world, swallowed it
      and spat out the earth, water, fire, sky and wind,
      and in the same way you created the world again.
      Now you make me stay in this world where the gods live.
      When will you take me from here?
      Take me to your shining world and make me join you
      so I may worship your divine feet.

3219. You bring the devotees who worship you
      from the earth and let them live beneath your feet adorned with sounding anklets.
      If the gods do not do what is right,
      you make them not to worship you in the sky
      and make them live on the earth.
      I, your slave, know that. O god resting on a snake bed,
      you made me give up my desires and worship your divine feet
      that others cannot find. I see you now.

3220. I have realized that the five pleasures of the senses—
      seeing, hearing, touching, smelling, and eating—are not good
      and I have seen how you and the goddess Lakshmi
      lovely with her shining bracelets
      have joined together and given me your grace,
      and so I have become your slave and reached your divine feet.

3221. Saḍagopan of flourishing Thirukkuruhur
      composed a thousand Tamil pāsurams on him
      describing how devotees could join the feet
      of Nāraṇan, Kesavan, the highest light.
      O devotees, learn these ten pāsurams
      and you will join his divine feet.

3222. When there was nothing,
      he created Nānmuhan, the gods, the world of the gods,
      the world and all the creatures in the world.
      Our ancient god stays in rich Thirukkuruhur
      filled with palaces as large as mountains
      and patios studded with diamonds.
      Why do you search for other gods?

3223. Our lord of matchless fame
      who abides with love in the temple
      of beautiful Thirukkuruhur filled with patios and palaces
      created you and he created all the gods you worship.
      O devotees from all parts of the world,
      go to Thirukkuruhur, sing and dance and praise the god.

3224. There is no other god equal to the highest god
      who created all the gods, many worlds,
      swallowed it all and spat it out,
      and who measured the world at the sacrifice of Mahābali
      and brought the earth from the underworld as a boar.
      O people of the world, even though you know this
      you do not understand his power. He stays in Thirukuruhur
      and all the other gods bow down their heads to him.
      Come and praise our lord.

3225. He is the lord of famous Shiva praised by all,
      Nānmuhan and all other gods.
      You know this is because he made the head of Nānmuhan
      fall from Shiva’s hand and released Shiva from his curse.
      The Lingayats say wrong things about our highest god
      of Thirukuruhur surrounded with large beautiful walls.
      What do they gain by doing that?

3226. O Lingayats, Jains, Buddhists, Sakyas,
      and others praised in the Purāṇas!
      You argue strongly about your religions and worship your gods,
      but he is in your souls and in all your gods.
      He stays and shines in Thirukuruhur
      where abundant good paddy blows in the wind as if fanned.
      He is the shining god of all religions. This is no lie. Praise him.

3227. Even though you praise other gods
      he protects you without caring that you are praising them,
      but he takes only his devotees because if all reach moksha,
      there will be no one left in the world.
      This is the māya of the powerful lord who stays in Thirukuruhur
      where good paddy and lotuses grow from the earth.
      Understand this and find out the right way to live.

3228. O devotees born in many births,
      you have searched for other gods, sung their praise,
      danced and worshiped them in all the ways described in the sastras
      but you have found no success.
      Our ancient lord carries an eagle flag and stays in Thirukkuruhur
      where the gods in the sky gather and praise him.
      Go and be his slave.

3229. The grace of Nārāyaṇan
      is what made the dancing god Shiva save Markandeya
      when he came and asked him to rescue him from Yama.
      That ancient lord stays in Thirukkuruhur
      surrounded with fences where the tālai flowers bloom
      like white herons in large ponds.
      Why do you go to other places and search for other gods?

3230. None of the six religions
      or any other religious texts know who god is.
      Our ancient god of beautiful Thirukkurukur
      surrounded with flourishing fields
      has entered your heart and stays there.
      Keep him in your heart—that is the path that will save you.

3231. The faultless lord contains in himself
      all that is and all that will be,
      all the worlds, all the gods and everything else.
      The lord who took the form of a dwarf
      and who dances the divine kudakkuthu dance
      stays in Thirukkuruhur surrounded by flourishing paddy
      and sugarcane fields. Let us serve him.

3232. Māran Sadagopan of rich Thirukkuruhur,
      the devotee of the lord with a fresh garland
      of fragrant makizham flowers on his chest,
      lovingly composed a thousand pāsurams
      for the god with a discus in his hand
      If devotees learn and recite these poems
      and know them well they will surely reach Vaikuṇṭam.

3233. I lied, praising you and saying,
      “You are a precious blue sapphire. You carry a discus.”
      I wandered and wandered
      and you thought I was truly praising you
      and gave me your grace.
      If it is my fate to receive your grace, no one can prevent it,
      O my lord Kaṇṇan! Tell me. Tell me please.

3234. I praised him, the faultless jewel
      who went between the two marudam trees,
      saying, “You are honey and sweet nectar.”
      I said only a few things praising him
      yet my dear lord entered my heart and became one with me
      and now the sky and this wonderful earth are all mine.

3235. I wanted to be involved in the pleasures of the world
      but I praised you with false words and said,
      “You are the generous lord. You have the color of sapphire.”
      Now I no longer want to cheat you.
      My devious mind has come to know you
      who rest on the flood of water and I am saved.
      I will not leave you. What is there for me but you?

3236. What should I do?
      Even though I said, “I will not leave you,”
      I was a thief and could not stop my mind
      from enjoying the pleasures of the world
      and I didn’t think of you.
      I can’t approach you making my hard heart soft and shedding tears
      and I can’t leave this life on the earth.
      O Kaṇṇan, take away my sins, call me and give me your grace.

3237. I can’t approach my dear lord Kaṇṇan,
      sweet as nectar, the precious jewel of the gods in the sky
      who put life in my body and tied it tightly
      with the ropes of ignorance and karma.
      I am covered with a body that is a skin-covered wound.
      Who can release me from it?
      O lord, you are the only one. Save me.

3238. My lord with beautiful lotus eyes,
      a red mouth, four strong arms,
      and a shining body like a dark jewel
      carries a discus in his beautiful hand
      that establishes dharma.
      When I saw him the evil and good karma
      that troubled me went away.

3239. The lord carrying a discus is dear to me.
      Where is he? Who am I?
      If any sinner has a good fate, the lord gives his grace to him.
      I folded my hands above my head and worshiped him crying out,
      “O lord, you took away the suffering of the elephant Gajendra!”
      and I became a true devotee of him, the highest god.
      He joined me with him.

3240. Māl worshiped by the gods in the sky
      and the sages on earth has come
      and entered this slave’s mind and now stays there firmly.
      From now on for me he is father, mother, good children,
      abundant wealth and lovely fish-eyed women.
      No one else is dear to me anymore.

3241. When I shivered on the ocean of birth
      like a boat that was sinking
      and worried how could I get help,
      the wonderful lord came in a beautiful form
      with a divine discus and a conch in his hands,
      gave his grace to me, said,“I will protect my devotee!”
      and became one with me.

3242. When I said, “O lord, you rule me,” to the cloud-colored lord
      who took the forms of a fish, turtle, man-lion, dwarf,
      of a boar in the forest and of Kalki,
      he was happy and gave me his sweet grace and became one with me, his slave.

3243. Sadagopan of Thirukkuruhur
      surrounded by beautiful flourishing fields
      composed a thousand lovely Tamil poems
      on our dark lotus-eyed Kannan.
      If devotees learn and recite these ten lovely poems
      they will shine and reach the feet of the lord.

3244. Let the world flourish! Let the world flourish!
      Let the world flourish!
      The evil curses of all creatures are destroyed
      and there is nothing for Yama who gives suffering and hell to people.
      See, the poverty of everyone will disappear.
      We the devotees of the ocean-colored one
      gather together, sing and dance.

3245. The devotees sing songs and dance praising the Madhavan
      adorned with lovely cool garlands swarming with bees.
      They jump around and shout, saying,
      “We saw, we saw, we saw things that are sweet to the eyes.
      O devotees, come, all of you. Worship, worship!”

3246. The evil Kaliyuga has passed and Krthāyugam has begun
      and all the gods and devotees come to the earth.
      Their hearts are filled with floods of abundant joy
      and the devotees of our dear ocean-colored, cloud-colored lord
      sing and praise him and wander all over the earth.

3247. The lord rests on the wide ocean
      and his devotees wander about
      as if everyone had ignored all other religions
      except Vaishnavism everywhere on the earth.
      They roll on the floor, sit, stand, walk, bend,
      fly, sing many songs, dance and act as if they were in a play.

3248. O creatures of the world!
      If you have been born as Asurans or Raksasas,
      there is no way you can survive even if eons and eons pass.
      There is only one thing I know that you must do in this world,
      and that is you must become devotees
      of the lord Vaikundan and remain in his māya.

3249. The lord who carries a discus came to the earth
      to remove the diseases that kill people,
      and enmity, hunger and all other evil things.
      His devotees wander all over the world,
      sing good songs, dance and jump.
      Keeping your mind in devotion,
      if you go and worship those devotees you will be saved.

3250. The other gods that you worship in your heart
      will not be able to protect you, and even if they do,
      it is because of the grace of lord Kaṇṇan.
      See, Mankadeya, the witness, was saved by Shiva
      and that is because of the grace of our god.
      You should not doubt this.
      There is no other god but Kaṇṇan.
      Whomever you worship, realize that he is a form
      of the god Kaṇṇan and worship him.

3251. The divine lord, the chief of the gods
      who embraces Lakshmi on his chest
      gives many duties to other gods,
      and people living on the earth praise those gods.
      O devotees, do not hate anyone in this world,
      but worship good people, sing songs
      and praise the devotees of the lord, and you will be saved.

3252. Many sages and devotees in this world
      worship the god Achudan
      with flowers, fragrances, lamps, sandal paste and abundant water,
      reciting the Vedas according to the sastras.
      Go and worship those devotees and you will be saved.

3253. The three gods, Shiva who laughs, Nānmuhan and Indra,
      and all other gods come to the world, join together
      and worship the divine god Kaṇṇan.
      O devotees who are everywhere in the world,
      go together and worship him
      and there will be no suffering in this Kaliyuga.

3254. Sadagopan, Kāri Māran of southern Thirukuruhur
      of the Pandiyan country that flourishes with fields,
      composed a thousand famous pāsurams on Māyapiran Kaṇṇan,
      the shining lord who gives his grace to his devotees
      and protects them from the troubles of Kaliyuga.
      If devotees learn and recite these ten poems,
      the faults in their minds will go away.

3255. She says,
      “O my friend, he is a faultless light, his mouth is red
      and he shines like a beautiful sapphire.
      I love the ancient god with a faultless nature—
      I have lost my mind to him. How long I can suffer like this?
      The village will gossip about my love soon.
      O friend, what can I do?”

3256. She says,
      “O friend, what can the gossip of the village do to me?
      I have lost myself to the love of my dear lotus-eyed Kaṇṇan
      and my body has lost its beautiful color, I am weak,
      and my red mouth and dark eyes have become pale.”

3257. She says, “O friend, he kicked Sakatāsuran
      when he came as a cart,
      and he drank the milk of the devil Putana.
      I have lost my chastity to my love for him.
      Wherever I go or wander I talk only of him
      and no other words come from my mouth.
      You are my only dear friend.
      What can the gossip of the village do to me?”

3258. She says, “O friend,
      the village gossip is like food for the plant of my love,
      and mother’s words are like water poured on it to make it thrive.
      The abundant love that our cruel cloud-colored Kaṇṇan
      placed in my heart has grown as large as the sea.”

3259. She says, “O friend, he is the tall Nedumāl, Māyan,
      who measured the world with his feet.
      Even though he is unkind and cruel and hard to know
      my useless heart thinks only of him. Alas!
      O beautiful friend with a waist as thin as a tuṭi drum,
      what do you think our mother will do
      if she knows about my love?”

3260. She says,
      “O friends, what if mother does what she wants?
      And what if the village gossips as it wants?
      Why should it bother me?
      I am caught in the love net of the sapphire-colored Vasudevan,
      the king of rich Dwarapuri, the ancient god of gods.”

3261. She says, “O beautiful friend with wide hips,
      my good heart is caught in the love net of the lord
      who carries a discus in his hands
      and rests on the ocean with rolling waves.
      I want to see him and bow bending my head at his feet.
      If I could worship him like that I would not worry
      even if I did so in front of my lovely friends.”

3262. She says, “O friend,
      our dear lord drank milk from the breasts of the devil Putana
      and he killed the elephant Kuvalayabeedam.
      When Sakatasuran came as a cart our god kicked it and destroyed him,
      and when an Asuran came as a bird our god split open his beak,
      He smiles beautifully with his red mouth that is like a thondai fruit.
      O friend, when will we join him and make our mother ashamed?”

3263. She says, “O friend,
      the god of the gods took my shyness and chastity
      and my heart went to him in the distant sky.
      Friend, this is my promise.
      I will tell all the world the mischievous deeds that he did
      and let everyone gossip about us. I won’t worry like other girls
      but I will ride on a madal, the palm-leaf horse.”

3264. She says, “When I ride on a madal
      and wear the cool thulasi garland with its pure petals
      of the dear god with a discus in his lovely hands,
      the women on our streets will say
      that I have no shame and gossip loudly about me.”

3265. Saḍagopan of Thirukuruhur,
      surrounded with fragrant groves,
      composed a thousand andādi poems
      praising the dark god Kaṇṇan colored like the roaring ocean.
      If devotees learn and recite these ten poems
      they will truly reach divine Vaikuṇṭam.

3266. She says, “The whole village is sleeping.
      The entire world is covered with deep darkness.
      All the creatures in the ponds are calm and the night grows long.
      The powerful one swallowed all the worlds and rests on a snake bed
      but he has not come to see me. I have done bad karma.
      Who will come and save me from the sorrow of love?”

3267. She says, “Who is there to come and save me?
      Darkness covers the deep ocean, the earth, and sky,
      unremitting and terrible. My Kaṇṇan,
      colored like a kāvi flower, has not come and I am pitiful.
      O my heart, you don’t help me either.”

3268. She says, “O heart, see, you are no help.
      The long night grows longer, like an eon,
      and the dawn does not come.
      My god Kahusthan who carries a strong bow,
      fights with his enemies and destroys them
      has not come. I have done bad karma
      and have been born a woman.
      I do not even know how to die.”

3269. She says, “The shining sun does not want to rise,
      thinking, ‘I don’t want to see the suffering
      of women, born on this earth.’
      Our god has a red mouth and large eyes.
      He is strong as a dark bull and measured the world.
      That beautiful one has not come.
      Who can take the sorrow and love sickness from my mind?”

3270. She says, “Who is there to help me?
      My mothers and friends do not think of my suffering
      and sleep through the long night.
      The cloud-colored Kaṇṇan has not come.
      I have done bad karma.
      People may remember my name to gossip about me.”

3271. She says, “The love I have for the god
      gives terrible pain to my heart.
      This night that seems like an eon doesn’t let me close my eyes.
      The eternal god Māyan who carries a discus in his hands has not come.
      Who can save my life here where the night is so long?”

3272. She says, “Who will save me now?
      The dark night passes slowly like an eon, drop by drop.
      The god Kaṇṇan with a pure white conch and a discus
      has not appeared. I have done bad karma.
      O gods, what can I do?”

3273. She says, “O gods, what can I do?
      As the dark night comes it is truly like seven eons and I feel weak.
      My dear god Kaṇṇan with a discus in his hand has not come.
      The cool breeze blows burning like the hot sun.”

3274. She says, “O gods, what can I do?
      The long night moves slowly and burns me like hot fire.
      The sun on his beautiful tall chariot
      with his hot rays has not yet appeared.
      Our precious lotus-eyed god has not come.
      Who will remove the sorrow of my heart?
      I am melting away with the sickness of love.”

3275. She says, “I am melting away with the pain of my love.
      Like me, the darkness in the wide sky melts away, drop by drop.
      The dear god who once measured the world has not come,
      yet the world rests, saying nothing at all about him.”

3276. Sadagopan of Thirukkuruhur surrounded with lovely groves
      composed a thousand andādi poems praising the divine lord
      who meditates, pretending to sleep on the milky ocean.
      If devotees learn and recite these ten pāsurams,
      how could they not be able to reach Vaikuṇṭam?

3277. She says, “O my mother, why are you upset with me?
      Ever since I saw Nambi, the god of Thirukurungudi,
      my heart thinks only of his conch,
      discus, lotus eyes and his sweet red fruit-like mouth.”

3278. She says, “O mothers, don’t be upset with me.
      Try to understand how I feel.
      Ever since I saw Nambi, the god of Thirikurungudi
      in the southern land surrounded with beautiful groves,
      my heart thinks only of the shining thread on his chest,
      his earrings, Lakshmi on his chest, his lovely ornaments
      and his four arms, and I see only them everywhere.”

3279. She says, “O mothers, you are upset with me and say,
      ‘You stand around not knowing what to do.
      You get confused sometimes. You worry a lot about something.’
      Ever since I saw Nambi of Thirukurungudi
      surrounded with mountain-like palaces,
      his victorious bow, club, sword, discus and conch
      appear before my eyes and don’t disappear,
      and they stay in my heart and don’t go away.”

3280. She says, “O mothers, you all get upset
      because my eyes don’t stop shedding tears.
      Ever since I saw Nambi of Thirukurungudi
      surrounded with groves that drip with honey,
      his cool thulasi garland, his golden crown, his lovely form,
      his matchless silk clothes and the sacred thread on his chest
      are always before me. I am pitiful.”

3281. She says, “O mothers, you say to me
      ‘You look everywhere for him and are worried and upset.’
      Ever since I saw the marvelous and famous Nambi of Thirukurungudi,
      his bright form, his mouth sweet as a thondai fruit,
      his long eyebrows and his perfect lotus eyes have taken over my life.
      I am a pitiful indeed.”

3282. She says, “My mother thinks,
      ‘This girl will bring disgrace to our family’
      and doesn’t let me go see him.
      Ever since I saw Nambi of Thirukurungudi surrounded with groves,
      his lovely long nose, lotus eyes, sweet fruit-like mouth,
      his blue body and four arms have filled my heart with love.”

3283. She says, “Mother thinks,
      ‘My daughter will bring disgrace to our family’
      and doesn’t allow me to go and see him.
      Ever since I saw Nambi of famous Thirukurungudi
      he, with a discus in his hands,
      has entered my heart with his tall golden body
      shining like a flood of light.”

3284. She says, "O mothers, you are upset
      thinking that I am suffering
      as I cover my lovely face with my hands.
      Ever since I saw Nambi of Thirukurungudi
      filled with palaces over which clouds float,
      his beautiful lotus eyes, his small waist, his lovely form,
      his thick long hair and his long arms appear in front of me. I am pitiful.”

3285. She says, “O friends and mothers, you are upset with me
      and say that I don’t listen to you but do as I want.
      Ever since I saw Nambi of Thirukurungudi filled with everlasting palaces,
      that ancient lord adorned with a tall crown on his head
      and with ornaments with precious jewels
      has entered my heart as if he were sugarcane juice,
      milk and nectar and doesn’t leave.”

3286. She says, “Mother thinks,
      ‘My daughter is utterly in love with him’
      and doesn’t allow me to go and see my beloved.
      The Nambi of Thirukurungudi who shines like a bright light
      has faultless fame. As soon as I saw him, he entered my heart,
      surrounded by a flood-like crowd of gods worshiping him.
      I don’t know how it happened—my heart rejoices.”

3287. Sadagopan of rich Thirukurungur,
      composed a thousand pāsurams on the lord
      with a discus in his divine hand whom no one has seen
      and worshiped him with fresh fragrant flowers,
      prattling and telling his praises.
      If devotees learn and recite these ten poems
      they will be true Vaishnavas
      in this world surrounded by deep oceans.

3288. My daughter says,
      “I am the creator of the world surrounded with oceans.
      I am the world surrounded by oceans.
      I am the ruler of the world surrounded by oceans.
      I split open the world surrounded by oceans.
      I swallowed all the worlds.”
      Has the lord of the world surrounded by oceans entered her body?
      What can I tell to the people of this world surrounded by oceans?
      I do not understand all that she learned in this world.

3289. My daughter says,
      “There is no limit to what I have learned.
      Whatever people learn is from me.
      I have created learning for people.
      I am the results of learning.
      I am the meaning of learning.”
      I am worried that the lord of learning has entered her heart
      and that is why she is saying all these things.
      What can I tell the learned ones
      about all these things my daughter says of learning?

3290. My daughter says,
      “I am all the lands that can be seen.
      I am the wide sky that people see.
      I am the fire that people feel.
      I am the wind that all feel.
      I am the oceans that people see.”
      Has the ocean-colored god entered my daughter’s heart?
      What can I tell the people of the world
      if they ask me why she is saying these things?
      What my daughter says is strange.”

3291. My daughter says,
      “I am all the acts that happen now.
      I am the acts that will happen in the future.
      I am the acts that have been done and are in the past.
      I myself experience the results of my acts.
      I create the people who act.”
      I am worried that the lotus-eyed Kaṇṇan
      has entered her heart and that is why she says these things.
      Her mouth is sweet as a fruit and she is as gentle as a young doe.
      What can I tell the good people of this world about my daughter?

3292. My daughter says,
      “I am protecting everyone and keep them on the right path.
      I carried Govardhana mountain without effort.
      I killed all the Asurans without exception.
      I saved the Pandavas using all my cleverness.
      I didn’t grow tired churning the ocean of milk.”
      Has the ocean-colored lord entered her heart?
      What can I tell the people of this world about my daughter?
      How can I tell all these things that my daughter tells me?

3293. My daughter says,
      “I carried bamboo-covered Govardhana mountain.
      I conquered the seven bulls.
      I graze the calves and milk-giving cows.
      I protect the herd of cows.
      I am the chief of the cowherds.”
      I am worried that the god of gods has entered her heart.
      What can I tell her friends whose eyes are as sharp as spears
      about my young daughter?

3294. My daughter says,
      “I have no relatives.
      All in this world are my relatives.
      I create relationships.
      I destroy relationships.
      I am the relative of relatives.”
      I am worried that Māyan who has no relative
      has entered my daughter’s heart.
      What can I tell our relatives
      about what my innocent daughter says?

3295. My daughter says,
      “I am the three-eyed lord and all the sastras praise me.
      I am the four-headed Nānmuhan and I am praised by all.
      I am the king of the gods and all praise me.
      I am the sages and they all praise me.”
      I am worried that the cloud-colored god
      praised by all has entered my daughter’s heart.
      What can I tell this world that says bad things,
      gossiping about my beautiful vine-like daughter?

3296. My daughter says,
      “I have no bad karma.
      I myself am bad karma.
      I give bad karma to all.
      I remove bad karma also.
      I destroyed the cruel Rāksasa Ravana in Lanka.”
      I am worried that the god who carries the heroic Garuda flag
      has entered my daughter’s heart.
      I am a pitiful mother.
      What can I tell the gossiping people of this world
      about my beautiful vine-like daughter?

3297. My daughter says,
      “I am beautiful paradise.
      I am evil hell.
      I am the highest shining heaven.
      I am the flourishing lives on this earth.
      I am the only ancient beautiful one.”
      I am worried that the dark cloud-colored god
      has entered my the heart of my daughter
      whose beautiful hair is decorated with flowers.
      What can I tell the people who adorn themselves with jewels
      and come and gossip?

3298. Saḍagopan of Thirukuruhur
      of the flourishing famous Pandian country
      composed a thousand pāsurams on the beloved of Lakshmi,
      the earth goddess on a lotus,
      and Nappinnai, the dear gentle girl of the cowherd clan.
      If devotees learn and recite these ten pāsurams
      they will obtain much wealth in this world
      and they will be the devotees of Thirumāl
      and have the fortune of worshiping his feet.

3299. However much tapas I may have done,
      I am not wise and will never be able
      to do anything without your grace.
      My father, our god, rests on a snake bed
      and stays in auspicious Srivaramangalam
      where lotuses grow in the mud among the good paddy.
      O lord, you are the highest god—
      there is no god higher than you.

3300. I can do nothing there,
      I can do nothing here.
      My only desire is to see you, but there is nowhere I can have that.
      My father with a conch and discus in your hand,
      destroyer of Lanka, who stay in Srivaramangalam
      where tall palaces studded with jewels touch the moon,
      I am lonely. Give me your grace.

3301. You with an eagle flag and a discus,
      the dark cloud-colored god of the sky,
      abide giving your grace in Srivaramangalam
      where many Vediyars live who know well
      all the four Vedas that are sources of wisdom.
      I was useless and you gave me worth and made me your slave.
      I do not know what I can give to repay you.

3302. You, my father, who fought a magical war with the hundred Kauravas
      when they opposed the Pandavas and you destroyed them
      and who split open the earth and brought forth the earth goddess.
      abide in Srivaramangalam
      where wise men know the Vedas well
      and recite them always and perform sacrifices.
      I want to reach you. How can I call you to come?

3303. You with a dark-colored body
      enter among all your enemies as one of them
      and perform many tricks to defeat them.
      Your devotees fold their hands and worship you
      in Srivaramangalam where Vediyars always perform sacrifices—
      that is something I myself have seen.
      How can I call and reach you?

3304. O my father, my lord of the sky and my ruler always,
      who became a boar and split open the earth,
      you are Vanamamalai, god of cool Srivaramanagalam
      surrounded by mango groves dripping with honey
      where your devotees fold their hands and worship you.
      O Kaṇṇan, jewel that shines like a diamond,
      come and give your grace to me, your slave,
      so I may worship you.

3305. You, the tender shoot of the gods in the sky,
      came, entered my heart and gave me your grace.
      You, the first father and mother of this world,
      who swallowed all the seven worlds,
      are god of Srivaramanagam where Vediyars whose work is pure
      recite the Vedas and perform unceasing sacrifices.
      You have endless fame. Do not leave me.

3306. I know well that you have created the five illusionary senses
      that keep people away from you,
      and I am worried that you will keep me away from you
      and make me fall into a happiness
      that is only the unclean mud that the five senses give,
      O lord who split open the beak of the Asuran that came as a bird,
      you stay in Srivaramangalam where the sun shines
      on the palaces studded with shining jewels.
      O father, no one can tell who you are, ever.

3307. You split open the beak of the Asuran,
      you entered between the two marudam trees and destroyed the Asurans
      and you are a thief who defeated the seven bulls
      and shine like a dark diamond.
      My father, who abide in Srivaramangalam
      where wise Vediyars live,
      knowing well and reciting the divine four Vedas,
      give me your grace so I may survive.

3308. Whom do I have except you?
      You, the divine lord of the gods,
      gave me your feet as refuge
      but I have nothing to give back to you.
      My life is yours.
      Adorned with a fresh fragrant thulasi garland,
      you stay in flourishing Srivaramangai
      where abundant good paddy and sugarcane grow in the earth.

3309. Sadagopan of Thirukkuruhur
      surrounded by groves blossoming with bunches of flowers
      composed a thousand poems
      worshiping the feet of the divine god of the gods,
      Thirivikraman, Nāraṇan.
      If devotees recite these ten pāsurams every day
      they will become sweet nectar for the gods in the sky.

3310. You are my sweet nectar.
      O Neḍumāl, this slave’s body dissolves, melts
      and becomes water with love for you
      who shine and rest beautifully on the water in Thirukuḍandai
      surrounded by the ocean with rolling waves
      where rich paddy plants blow in the wind like fans.
      O my father, I saw you there.

3311. You, my ruler strong as a bull,
      take whatever form you please with your pure form.
      You close your beautiful lotus eyes
      and rest in divine Kuḍandai
      where lovely red lotuses bloom on fertile water.
      What should I do?

3312. What can I do in this life?
      Who is my refuge?
      What do you want to do with me?
      I will not go to anyone to tell my troubles except you
      who rest in Thirukuḍandai surrounded by strong walls.
      Give me your grace so that I, your slave,
      may spend all the days of my life worshiping your feet.

3313. No one can describe you or your measureless fame.
      You have no end. O god, lord and owner of all the world,
      you rest on the water in Kuḍandai where many good people live.
      Yearning to see you, I look at the sky, cry and worship you.

3314. I cry for you, I worship you, I dance for you, prattle and sing.
      Looking for you and yearning to embrace you,
      I feel shy and lower my head.
      O lord with lovely lotus eyes, you rest on the water in Kuḍandai
      surrounded by beautiful flourishing fields.
      Show me how I, your slave, can join your feet.

3315. Even though I know how to remove the fruits of my bad karma
      I am still involved in the pleasures of my five senses.
      How long can I live like this away from you?
      O king of the gods in the sky,
      resting on the water in ancient, famed Kuḍandai
      you are the sweet music of the yazh,
      you are nectar, you are the fruit of knowledge, you are a lion.

3316. You are the lion king, a shining golden light,
      a dark cloud with lovely eyes,
      a coral mountain as bright as fire,
      my father with have four arms.
      You, the Thirumāl of divine Kuḍandai ,
      accepted me as your slave
      and I do not want to be apart from you ever.
      I cannot stay in this world any more.
      Give me your grace so I will not be born again on this earth.

3317. I do not know whether you wish
      to take away my sorrow or not,
      but I have no refuge except you with your round discus
      the wonderful Māyan resting on the water in Kuḍandai.
      When my body grows weak and life leaves my body,
      give me your grace to hold to your feet tightly,
      not leaving them and joining you.

3318. O my father, you, the lord of the everlasting gods,
      make me accept you and keep me beneath your feet.
      As the everlasting world sings praises,
      you, the great ancient god, rest on the water in divine Kuḍandai
      where the waves bring precious diamonds
      and leave them on the banks of the river.
      Come to me, I yearn to see you.

3319. You, formless, are my Maayan and divine nectar,
      living sweetly in the heart of me, your slave.
      Ruling me, you have removed the karma
      that seemed impossible to remove
      and you have made me your devotee, O god of divine Kuḍandai.
      How can I suffer any more in this world?

3320. Sadagopan of Kuruhur took refuge in the feet of the lord
      and composed a thousand pāsurams sweeter than the music of the flute
      to the god who drank milk from the devil Putana and killed her.
      If devotees learn and recite these ten pāsurams
      they will be like Kama, the god of love,
      for women with lovely doe-like eyes.

3321. She says, “O friends with beautiful doe-like eyes,
      the god, our king, stays in Thiruvallam
      surrounded by groves where the fragrance of jasmine spreads
      and kamugu trees grow tall and touch the sky,
      flourishing and dripping with honey.
      Every day I suffer with my bad karma.
      When will the day come when this slave of the god can join him?”

3322. She says, “O friends, what do you get by making me suffer?
      He is our dear lord of Thiruvallam
      where the breeze blows through fresh madhavi plants,
      mahizham flowers and punnai trees
      that bloom with golden blossoms and spread their fragrance.
      When will the day come when I, a slave of the dear lord,
      can worship his feet?”

3323. She says, “O friends with flowers in your hair,
      he is our dear lord of flourishing Thiruvallam
      where the divine sound of the Vedas
      spreads like the roaring of the waves of the ocean
      and the smoke of sacrifices rises above the palaces.
      When will I be able to see every day
      the ankleted feet of the dear god?
      I grow weak longing to see him.”

3324. She says, “O friends, why do you make me worry every day?
      What do you get from that?
      My god rests on the river on a snake bed
      in Thiruvallam where tall kamugu trees with long green leaves,
      jack trees, coconut trees and banana trees
      grow tall and touch the tops of the palaces with porches.
      My life is with that dear god.”

3325. She says, “You are my dear friends and you worry about me.
      He is the god of Thiruvallam where the dark smoke of the sacrifices
      performed by the good Vediyars rises up and hides the sky.
      He is sweet as jaggery, fruit and nectar and shines like a bright light.
      He has made me sick with love.
      When will my eyes see him?”

3326. She says, “O lovely friends with mouths as sweet as fruits,
      I have done bad karma.
      When will I see the lotus feet of the god
      who took the divine form of a beautiful dwarf,
      went to Mahābali’s sacrifice and measured the world and the sky,
      the god of Thiruvallam where flourishing trees
      with branches that touch the sky grow on the rich seashore
      and bees swarm singing with lovely voices
      and cool breezes blow everywhere?”

3327. She says, “O friends as lovely as dolls,
      our lord who swallowed the world is the god of Thiruvallam
      where lovely lotuses and sengazhuneer flowers
      blooming on the wide rippling pond
      look like the shining faces and eyes of women.
      When will I join the beautiful ornamented lotus feet
      of the dear god?”

3328. She says, “O friends with beautiful foreheads,
      when will I worship every day without ever leaving them
      the ornamented feet that measured the world?
      He stays always in rich Thiruvallam
      surrounded by fields, rich flowering ponds,
      sweet sugarcane and good paddy plants
      that grow everywhere and wave in the breeze.”

3329. She says, “O friends, when will the day come
      when I see and worship the god of Thiruvallam
      where lined bees drink honey and sing like babies,
      sounding like the music of the yaazh and flute in the cool groves?
      When will I receive the divine grace of the god with a discus in his hands
      and join him and be happy so that my bangles stay on my arms?”

3330. She says, “O friends,
      when will I have good karma and join the god?
      He is the lord of beautiful Thiruvallam
      where the earth and the sky worship him to receive his divine grace.
      A thousand good Vediyars live there
      and praise the names of our dear god Narayaṇan.
      He gives his good grace to all.”

3331. Sadagopan of southern Thirukkuruhur
      that gives good life to all composed a thousand poems
      praising the feet of our divine god
      who is worshiped with a thousand names.
      If the devotees of Thiruvallam
      learn and recite these ten pāsurams,
      if they are born in this world they will have happy lives.

3332. O best of gods, born magically and raised as a man,
      you did many tricks in the Bharatha war for the Pandavas
      and helped them conquer the Kauravas.
      All that magic and all those tricks enter my heart and make me melt.
      You are the bright light that did all those tricks. When will I join you?

3333. You conquered the seven bulls to marry Nappinnai,
      when the Asuran Kesi came as an illusionary horse
      you split open his mouth,
      and you danced the kuravai kuthu with girls whose long hair
      was decorated with lovely flowers dripping with honey.
      No one can say whether your actions are this,
      that or something in between,
      but whatever they are, they hurt me.
      You are the ancient lord!
      When will I come and join you?

3334. O god, when you were a child
      you drank the poisonous milk from the breasts of the devil Puthana
      when she came wearing flowers in her lovely hair.
      You kicked and killed Sakatasuran when he came as a cart,
      and when you stole the butter and ate it,
      your mother Yashoda hit you with a stick
      and you stood in front of her as your lotus eyes filled with tears.
      When I think how you stood and cried, it hurts my heart.

3335. You disguised yourself in many different ways,
      entered the places of your enemies and conquered them.
      You made the Asurans fight each other with your tricks and killed them.
      Shiva with the Ganges flowing in his matted locks is not different from you.
      When I think of all your deeds
      they enter my heart and make my life melt.

3336. You ate the food that the cowherds served
      for Indra the king of the gods.
      You carried large, beautiful Govardhana mountain
      as an umbrella and protected the cows from a storm.
      You swallowed the earth and spit it out.
      When I think of all your magical deeds my heart melts like wax in fire.

3337. Your standing, sitting and lying forms
      are hard for me even to imagine—
      you have a form yet you have none.
      I think of all your magical deeds again and again.
      In which form can I think of you,
      the shining light that swallowed the earth?
      Tell this sinner how to think of you.

3338. You came to me as a shining light,
      as darkness, as truth and as the false.
      You, a dark diamond, hide
      and do not show me who you are and I suffer yearning to see you.
      Come and show me your divine form one day
      so my eyes may see you and find joy.

3339. You rest on the ocean in a divine reclining form
      and Nanmuhan staying on a beautiful lotus on your navel
      creates the world and its creatures through your grace.
      When I hear of all your supreme matchless deeds,
      my heart melts and my eyes shed tears like a waterfall.
      What can this slave do?

3340. You went to Mahābali’s sacrifice, begged for two feet of land
      and took the sky and the earth with two steps.
      When I hear these great deeds of yours my heart melts.
      I have done bad karma—when can I reach you?

3341. Joining the gods you churned the milky ocean
      and then, disguised as Mohini, you cheated the Asurans
      so they would not get the nectar, and you distributed it to the gods.
      O lord resting on a snake bed, you entered my heart and melted my soul.
      Tell me how can I come and join you?

3342. Sadagopan Maaran of Thirukkuruhur,
      worshiping the god every day
      and thinking that his only refuge is the lord resting on a snake bed,
      composed a thousand poems praising the god.
      If devotees learn and recite these ten pāsurams well
      they will reach Vaikuṇṭam and be happy always.

3343. She says, “O kurugu birds,
      you come in the morning every day
      and wander in the flourishing backwaters.
      Go and see the lord whose mouth is as sweet as a fruit.
      He carries a discus and stays in Thiruvaṇvaṇḍur
      where the good paddy grows tall.
      Fold your hands and worship him
      and tell him that I have done bad karma
      and I suffer from love for him.”

3344. She says, “O large cranes,
      you wander here with your beloved mates.
      Go and see our dear lord who swallowed all the worlds,
      the god of cool Thiruvaṇvaṇḍur
      where the Vedas are recited loudly
      when the Vediyars perform sacrifices.
      Bow to his feet and tell him how I suffer from his love.”

3345. She says, “O flock of birds, you all come together
      and fly around everywhere on these fields.
      Go and see the dear god with a whirling discus in his hand.
      His mouth is as sweet as a fruit
      and he is the lord of beautiful Thiruvaṇvaṇḍur flourishing with wealth.
      Fly down to the ground, bow to him
      and tell him how I, his slave, suffer with love for him.”

3346. She says, “O lovely swans, you join your mates
      and plunge into happiness without any worries.
      Go and see Neḍumaal, the ocean-colored Kaṇṇan,
      the god of flourishing Thiruvaṇvaṇḍur
      where the sound of the Vedas spreads everywhere.
      Make him understand that there is a girl
      who suffers and melts with love for him.”

3347. She says, “O lovely swans,
      you know how it is to fight and make up with your mates
      and you wander together happily without being apart from them.
      Go and see our dear lord
      whose head is adorned with a cool beautiful thulasi garland
      and who stays in Thiruvaṇvaṇḍur
      where the waves bring conches and pile them on the shore.
      Go and bow to him, fold your hands and praise him for me also.”

3348. She says, “O beautiful cuckoo birds on your punnai trees,
      I praise you and implore you.
      He is the highest god of the gods in the sky,
      he carries a powerful discus in his beautiful hands
      and he is the lord of divine Thiruvaṇvaṇḍur
      where valai fish frolic in the muddy water.
      Go see him and tell him how I suffer from his love.
      Bring me his reply so my pain will go away.”

3349. She says, “O lovely parrot, go directly, without wandering,
      and enter Thiruvaṇvaṇḍur where my god stays
      surrounded by shores with red sand
      and groves blooming with lovely flowers.
      He has a dark color, a red mouth, lovely eyes,
      reddish hands and beautiful feet
      and he carries in his hand a shining discus for fighting and a conch.
      That is how you can recognize him.
      Tell him that I love him.”

3350. She says, “O lovely little puvai bird,
      my god has large beautiful lotus eyes, long hair, four strong arms,
      and a dark divine body the color of thick clouds.
      He stays in rich Thiruvaṇvaṇḍur
      surrounded by mahizh, punnai, nyazhal and cherunti trees.
      See him, tell him of my love and then return and tell me what he has told you.”

3351. She says, “O swans living among lotus flowers,
      the god, the tricky Māyan, Nedumaal, Kaṇṇan, stays in Thiruvaṇvaṇḍur
      where conches are blown in the morning.
      I have done bad karma. Go, see the lord and worship him.
      Talk to him secretly and tell him how I am suffering.”

3352. She says, “O swarm of bees flying around fragrant flowers,
      I would ask a favor of you.
      The god who destroyed the forts of Lanka
      of the Rakshasa king Ravana whom no enemies could subdue
      stays in Thiruvaṇvaṇḍur on the bank
      of the northern Pampa river that flows with abundant water.
      Go and tell that victorious hero that I am still alive.”

3353. Sadagopan of Thirukuruhur composed
      a thousand poems with music on the god,
      the cunning thief who went to Mahābali as a dwarf
      adorned with a sacred shining thread
      and took over the wide world in two footsteps.
      If devotees learn and recite these ten musical pāsurams
      on the god of Thiruvaṇvaṇḍur
      they will be like Kama for women with waists thin as lightning.

3354. She says, “You are Māyavan
      and you burned the forts in Lanka of the king Ravaṇa.
      I am afraid when I see the girls
      whose waists are thin as lightning
      that you have cheated, loving them and leaving them.
      I know how you deceive.
      What are you going to do now to cheat me?
      O Nambi, give me back my ball and dice and then go.”

3355. She says, “O Nambi, go away.
      Your lotus eyes, red mouth and smile annoy us.
      We did so much tapas to love you
      but you just give us trouble.
      There are other girls, as lovely as peacocks,
      waiting to love you.
      They want to hear the sound of your flute.
      Go, graze your cows and play your flute
      and go to them. Please go away.”

3356. She says, “O Nambi, go and tell your lies
      to those who do not know how you cheat girls.
      Your big sweet fruit-like mouth and large eyes are dangerous!
      Who among the girls with round bamboo-like arms
      has enough tapas to receive your divine grace?
      You are the highest god who churned the large milky ocean.”

3357. She says, “You swallowed all the seven worlds
      and recline on a banyan leaf.
      Even the gods in the sky do not know your magic.
      O my highest lord, you are skilled at grazing cows
      while cowherd girls with large lovely spear-like eyes
      stay around you and play.
      Don’t try to play with me.”

3358. She says, “O Nambi, with a powerful, ancient discus,
      don’t lie and cheat us.
      All the world and the sky know your tricks.
      I want to tell you something.
      The girls who speak like babies
      with their honey-sweet soft words
      are upset and wait for your grace.
      Don’t play with our prattling puvai birds and our parrots.”

3359. She says, “There is no use making faces
      and doing tricks to make us think you love us.
      We have been with you for a long time,
      O highest god—is this is way you show your grace?
      There are many lovely women
      as beautiful as goddesses of the three worlds
      and worthy of your love.
      Don’t play with us.
      You play like this because you are young.”

3360. She says, “It is not right to grab the dolls
      that we hold in our hands to play with.
      O lord, Neḍumaal, faultless one
      who swallowed the world surrounded by oceans,
      even if you do something wrong, mistakes are mistakes.
      You play with us and cheat us with your sweet words.
      If my brothers hear what you say
      they won’t consider whether it is right or not to act.
      They will take sticks and come to fight with you.”

3361. She says, “Your form is like a flood of wisdom
      and, shining with endless fame,
      you create without fail both creatures that are intelligent
      and creatures that are ignorant.
      My friends are calling me to go play with them
      but you come and attract me with your love so I can’t join them.
      If people see me with you, what will they think?”

3362. She says, “You attract us with your large lotus eyes
      and you want us to fall in love with you, melting in our hearts.
      You kicked and broke our small play houses with your divine feet.
      That wasn’t fair.
      You didn’t just look at our play houses and the food we made for them,
      and you didn’t just stand there with your shining face and smile at us,
      but you kicked over our small play houses.
      That wasn’t right.”

3363. She says, “You have a shining crown and carry an axe
      that conquered and destroyed the kings of thirty-one generations.
      A bright, dark diamond, you created this wide world in ancient times
      and now you have been born among the cowherd families
      to give them moksha, but see, you are naughty
      and you always give us cowherd girls trouble.”

3364. Sadagopan of Thirukuruhur
      composed a thousand pāsurams with music on the god, our father, the dancer
      who cried when his mother Yashoda, the cowherdess,
      was angry with him because he stole butter and tied him up.
      If devotees learn and recite with their tongues these ten pāsurams
      they will have no troubles in their lives.

3365. I saw the omnipresent god who is poverty and wealth,
      heaven and hell, friend and enemy, nectar and poison.
      He rules me who stays in Thiruviṇṇagar
      where families live with abundant wealth.

3366. I saw the lord whom no one can see,
      who is joy and sorrow,confusion and clarity,
      anger and affection, heat and coolness.
      He rules me who stays in beautiful Thiruviṇṇagar,
      surrounded by water with clear waves.

3367. I saw the lord who is countries and cities, wisdom and ignorance,
      unmatched enveloping light and darkness, and the earth and sky.
      There is no good karma for anyone
      without praising the fame of the lord
      of Thiruviṇṇagar surrounded by palaces.

3368. I saw the lord who is virtue and sin
      joining and separation, remembrance and forgetfulness,
      all that is in the world, all that is not in the world,
      existence, non-existence and nothing.
      Find the sweet grace of Kaṇṇan, our dear god of Thiruviṇṇagar,
      the ruler of all the three worlds surrounded by strong palaces,

3369.I saw the god who is bad and good, black and white,
truth and falsehood. youth and age, new and old.
Our god in Thiruviṇṇagar surrounded by strong walls,
is the lord of the three worlds, and see, he will protect them all.

3370. The highest shining lord who is happiness and hatred,
      fame and infamy and Lakshmi and the inauspicious goddess
      is the god of Thiruvinnagar, the highest light
      who is in the three worlds but not of them,
      whom the gods in the sky come to worship
      and who abides in this sinner’s mind.

3371. The mischievous lord who is light and divinity,
      and purity and impurity stays in the world
      hiding himself but presenting himself to all.
      The gods from the sky come and worship,
      our god of Thiruviṇṇagar, bowing their heads.
      There is no refuge for anyone other than the feet of the lord
      who give boons to all.

3372. Kaṇṇan, my father, who is the ruler and refuge for the gods and all,
      cruel Yama for the Asurans and the protector of the good people
      abiding in the shadow of his feet and the enemy of the wicked
      stays in Thiruviṇṇagar and protects the southern direction.

3373. The matchless god of Thiruviṇṇagar
      surrounded with shining golden walls,
      my father and friend and the mother who gave birth to me,
      as precious as gold, diamonds and pearls,
      granted me refuge beneath his feet.

3374. Our lord
      who is shadow and sunlight, small and great,
      short and tall, things that move and do not move,
      and everything else
      stays always in Thiruviṇṇagar
      where the bees sing as sweetly as babies.
      I have no other refuge than his ankleted feet.

3375. Sadagopan of Thirukuruhur
      composed a thousand pāsurams on the lord
      who measured the world and the sky with his two feet
      and said, “O people of the world, see my feet!”
      If devotees learn and recite these ten pāsurams on Thiruviṇṇagar
      they will become the gurus of the gods in the sky.

3376. Our lord who danced the kuravai dance with the cowherd girls,
      carried Govardhana mountain to protect the cows
      and danced on the head of the snake Kalingan
      in the pond with churning water rests on a snake bed.
      I prattle night and day,
      telling all his magic deeds without stopping.
      What bad things can happen to me from now on?

3377.My heart melts and my time passes sweetly
when I think how he plays sweet music and grazes the cows
and how he married Nappinnai with lovely eyes like keṇṭai fish
and curly hair adorned with fragrant flowers
and when I think of the other magical deeds of the lovely lord.
When I can live loving the god like this,
what world could be my equal?

3378. The lord who gives his grace to all every day
      killed the matchless heroic wrestlers,
      grazed the herd of cows,
      and killed the angry long-trunked elephant Kuvalayabeeḍam.
      I think always and prattle on about these deeds
      and others like them of the radiant lord praised by all.
      He gives his grace to me every day—
      what suffering can there be for me now?

3379. The lord drank the milk of the cheating devil Puthana,
      kicked the cart and killed Sakaṭasuran when he came as a cart
      and cried when Yashoda tied him to a mortar.
      When I think of all the heroic deeds of the beautiful god of gods
      my heart melts and feels it is always with him.
      What more could I want?

3380. The lord was born as Kaṇṇan
      when the gods asked him to come and destroy the Rakshasas.
      While his mother Devaki suffered and cried,
      his father Vasudeva took him in the darkness
      to a cowherd village where he was raised
      to grow up and kill Kamsan with his cheating tricks.

      How could there be any enemy for me?

3381. The Māyan killed the Asuran
      when he came as a bird and split open his beak,
      killed seven bulls to marry Nappinnai,
      broke the kurundam trees that grew tall in the groves
      and measured the wide world at the sacrifice of Mahābali.
      Night and day I praise the magical deeds of my father.
      I will have no trouble in my heart.

3382. My father, my lord who showed his compassion
      by being born to help the wicked people of the earth,
      took any form he wished.
      Adorned with a forest thulasi garland on his chest,
      he came to the earth because he was angry at the evil Rakshasas.
      I think always of the magical deeds of my father, the lord.
      Who is there as fortunate as I?

3383. My god who amazed the world fighting many terrific battles
      cut off the thousand arms of Vaṇasuran
      and measured the earth and sky at the sacrifice of Mahābali.
      I know all the magical deeds of my father, the Māyan,
      and there is no distress in my mind anymore.

3384. Our dark-colored lord who swallowed all the seven seas,
      the seven mountains and the seven worlds
      drove the chariot for Arjuna with his māyam,
      carrying a discus in his right hand and a conch in his left.
      I prattle on, praising the dark-colored god with my tongue
      and that is all I want to do.

3385. My chief who made Arjuna fight in the terrible Bharatha war
      to remove the suffering of the earth, performed many magic deeds
      and, wearing the garland of victory, destroyed the Kaurava army

      who could be my lord in this world but he?

3386. Sagagopan of Thirukuruhur worshiped the feet
      of the lord Kesavan and composed a thousand pāsurams.
      The lord swallowed all the seven worlds,
      kept them in his stomach and at end of the world
      spat them out from his mouth.
      If devotees learn and recite these ten pāsurams
      they will become his faultless devotees.

3387. Her friends say,
      “O mothers! She worships Tholaivillimangalam
      filled with palaces studded with bright faultless diamonds.
      O mothers, you took her to Tholaivillimangalam
      and brought her back
      and now she has fallen in love with the god and says,
      ‘In his hands he carries a shining conch that produces pearls and a discus.
      His big eyes are beautiful as lotuses.’
      Her eyes, as beautiful as kuvalai flowers, fill with tears
      and she stands and cries.”

      “O mothers, you took your daughter whose soft words are sweet as nectar
      to Tholaivillimangalam where the noise of festivals is loud

      and her eyes are filled with tears and she melts with love for him.”

3389. Her friends say,

      You took her to Thirutholaivillimangalam
      on the banks of the Thamiraparaṇi river

      even though she didn’t want to return.
      She says, ‘He rests on the milky ocean roaring with waves.
      He measured the earth and the sky. He grazes the cows.’
      She prattles on and her long eyes are filled with tears.”

3390. Her friends say,
      “O mothers, look. You took her to Thirutholaivillimangalam
      where Vediyars who know all four Vedas live.
      After she returned she has forgotten how to be shy.
      She doesn’t want to listen to you but says,
      ‘All that I have learned and know is about the dark-colored Kaṇṇan.’
      She repeats this again and again, never growing tired.
      In her heart she is happy and melts for him.”

      and she thinks only of him.
      She constantly looks in the direction where god stays and worships him.”

3392. Her friends say,

      of the Thamiraparaṇi river where the fields flourish
      with good paddy and sugarcane wherever one looks
      and lovely red lotuses bloom everywhere.
      Every day your daughter looks in his direction.
      She doesn’t look anywhere else
      and her mouth says only the names of the diamond-colored god.”

3393. Her friends say,
      “O mothers, your daughter is as beautiful as a peacock
      and innocent as a small doe.
      She refuses to listen to anything we say
      but only repeats the word ‘Tholaivillimangalam.’
      Is this the fruit of the tapas that she did in her last birth
      or is it the magic of the cloud-colored god?
      She constantly speaks his divine name
      and talks of his discus, sword, club and conch.
      Her mouth can say only the god’s names clearly.”

3394. Her friends say,
      “O mothers, Thirutholaivillimangalam
      on the northern bank of the Thamirabaraṇi river
      is filled with the sound of the sacred Vedas,

      Ever since your large dark-eyed daughter began to worship the god,
      she has been saying ‘O lord, you have lotus eyes!’
      and her heart has melted and she suffers.”

3395. Her friends say,
      “O mothers, she worries every day and is afraid to say anything.
      Her eyes are filled with tears
      and when she calls out saying, ‘O dark diamond-colored god!’
      even the trees feel sorry for her.
      Ever since she learned the divine name of the city
      she has worshiped the god folding her hands
      and said, ‘That is Tholaivillimangalam of the god
      who split open the mouth of the Asuran that came as a horse.’”

3396. Her friends say,
      “O mothers, is she Nappinnai?
      Is she the lovely earth goddess?
      Is she beautiful Lakshmi?
      She was born on this earth—what magic is this?
      She calls to him loudly, ‘O Neḍumāl!’
      Her heart wants to hear the divine names of the lord of Tholaivillimangalam
      and she worships him bowing her head.”

      the dark cloud-colored Maal.”

3399. Her mother says,
      “The god who carries in his hands
      a conch, bow, sword, club and a discus

      and went as a messenger to the Kauravas for the Pandavas
      to ask for their lands.

      go to Thirukoḷur surrounded by flourishing fields?
      Tell me—I have done bad karma.”

3411. Her mother says,
      “My daughter’s puvai birds,
      green parrots, balls, wood dolls and flower baskets
      all join her in calling out the divine names of Thirumāl.
      Will my doll-like daughter reach Thirukoḷur surrounded by cool fields?
      What can she do if her lips that are like kovai fruits throb
      and her eyes shed tears like rain?”

3412. Her mother says,
      “My daughter, as beautiful as a young deer,
      decided to go, bending her soft waist,
      to flourishing Thirukoḷur where the god rests on the ocean.

      that she is a shameless girl and her character is bad
      or will they say she is good because she goes to see the god?”

3413. Her mother says,
      “My little daughter, as beautiful as a goddess,
      does not want to play with her toys and only worries and worries.

3414. Her mother says,
      “My daughter, soft as a young deer
      does not want to help me in the house
      and has gone to southern Thirukoḷur,

      as her long eyes fill with tears and she worries?”

3415. Her mother says,
      “My daughter says night and day ‘Neḍumāl!’
      as her eyes fill with tears
      and her heart fills with love for him.

      where the lord rests on the ocean.

      worry and fret, her eyes filling with tears and her heart melting,

      stays happily with her husband?
      Her heart sad, my young daughter has left me.”

3417. Her mother says,
      “When my daughter sees good things,
      she says, ‘This is for my Kaṇṇan!’
      and she thinks of her love for him.

      she walks to Thirukoḷur and doesn’t think of me.
      The village is filled with gossip about her.”

3418. Her mother says,
      “O gods, I cannot think of all the things she is doing.
      My young doe-like daughter with long eyes doesn’t stop even for a moment
      thinking of the lotus-eyed god, the ruler of the whole world.

3420. Her daughter says,
      “O birds who do good for others, would you do me a favor?
      I have done bad karma and I ask one thing of you.
      The dark cloud-colored Kaṇṇan who created all the worlds
      has taken my happiness away. Go and tell him how I suffer.
      If you help me you will reach moksha
      and rule the golden world there,
      and you will rule this whole world also.”

3421. Her daughter says,
      “O parrots, fly quickly and go to see the highest lord
      with a mouth as sweet as a fruit and a discus in his hand.
      Go and tell him that my love is true.
      If you do that I will keep you among my young friends
      whose long sharp eyes are decorated with kohl
      and feed you sweet rice mixed with ghee.”

3422. Her daughter says,
      “O bees who fly together in a swarm,
      won’t you taste the lovely shining flowers in my hair
      after tasting and drinking honey from the cool thulasi garland
      that the god wears who stood on a tall chariot on the battlefield
      and destroyed his enemies for the five Pāndavas, the rulers of Kuruksetra?”

3423. Her daughter says,
      “O thumbi flies that swarm around my mullai flowers
      and drink honey from them,
      if you go to drink the honey of flowers,
      be sure to see the king of the gods
      adorned with a cool thulasi garland
      that drips with sweet honey.
      Surely, I have done bad karma
      for he lied to me and left me.
      Ask him, ‘Is what you do fair? She loves you.
      What do you want from her to love her back?’”

3424. Her daughter says,
      “O parrots that I raised,
      I want to tell you something—come.
      I have done bad karma.
      The god that rides on cruel-eyed Garuḍa
      saw me and attracted my heart.
      If you see that lord who is generous as the Karpaga tree,
      with beautiful eyes, a color dark as a cloud and a red mouth,
      ask him, ‘Is what you do fair?’”

3425. Her daughter says,
      “O small puvai birds that I raised,
      I have done bad karma.
      The highest dark-colored Kaṇṇan
      with a shining sacred thread on his chest
      will not give the cool thulasi garland
      that adorns his long body to anyone but me.
      Wherever you fly say the words I have taught you.
      When you see him ask him, ‘Is what you do fair?’”

3426. Her daughter says,
      “The lotus-eyed god
      who split open the beak of the Asuran that came as a bird
      carries a discus and has the dark color of kaayam flowers.
      He is everything and everyone.
      O my friends lovely as dolls, I have done bad karma.
      Go and tell the god Madhusudanan of my love
      and ask him to take away my pain.”

3427. Her daughter says,
      “O white kurugu bird with faultless white feathers,
      have pity on me.
      I no longer have any love for my relatives.
      How many eons can I suffer?
      Go and see the king of gods adorned with a shining crown
      and a faultless dark color and tell him,
      ‘She doesn’t want to think of anyone but you, the faultless one.
      She is waiting for you to give her your grace.’”

3428. Her daughter says,
      “O flock of cranes searching for food
      and wandering near the rippling water,
      I have done bad karma. I have no refuge but him.
      Go and see the beautiful thick cloud-colored Kaṇṇan,
      the king of the gods in the sky, and tell him of my love sickness,
      and then come back at dawn and tell me what he said to you.”

3429. Her daughter says,
      “O swans sitting happily on flowers with your beloved mates,
      so close to them there is no space between you,
      go to my lord who has lovely Lakshmi on his chest
      and tell him, ‘Look at her condition. She suffers with love for you.’

      and then come back in the morning and tell me his answer.”

3430. Sadagopan of Thirukuruhur
      surrounded by fragrant blooming groves

      If devotees learn these ten pāsurams and recite them
      their hearts will melt for the god
      like soft sand in a spring.

3431. O lord, you are the ocean, earth, fire, wind and the wide sky,
      the bright sun and the moon, Shiva and Nānmuhan.
      I have done bad karma.
      One day please come to me carrying your sharp discus
      and your white conch as the earth and sky exult in joy.

3432. You, the magical one, my mother,
      took the form of a dwarf
      and measured the earth and sky at Mahābali’s sacrifice.
      Come to this earth one day
      and I will approach you, see you and dance happily.

3433. You come to this earth.
      walk, stand and sleep and protect the creatures of the world,
      staying here happily.
      I, your devotee, want to see you with the divine Lakshmi—
      I have grown tired waiting so long to see you.

3434. When Sakatasuran came as a cart
      with your feet you, the highest god, kicked and killed him,
      breaking the cart into pieces
      so the whole world would know your power.
      Show yourself in the sky one day,
      surrounded by Nānmuhan, Shiva, Indra and all the gods,
      so the whole world can see you.

3435. You, the god of the sky,
      who stand in the Thiruvenkaṭam hills
      and recline on the milky ocean
      have come to the earth in many forms.
      You abide, hiding yourself,
      and are above our thoughts and above the earth.
      You are in my soul and you stay there
      but you do not reveal your form to my eyes.

3436. Putting one foot on this earth
      and taking over all the land,
      you are the Māyon who took the whole earth at Mahābali’s sacrifice.
      I melt like wax in fire,
      suffering to see you and wandering in the world.

3437. You are all the actions of the world,
      the refuge for all creatures of the world,
      and the world and the soul on this earth.
      You have no form but you shine in all the ten directions.
      Give me, an ignorant one, your grace, O shining lord.

3438. I am ignorant—give your grace to me, your slave.
      O shining Neḍumāl, my wise soul,
      are you playing with me, cheating me and spoiling me?
      You shock my heart with your games
      but I know nothing but loving you.

3439. All my five senses hurt and shock my soul.
      Why do you play with me, a sinner, so much and make me suffer?
      You have measured the world
      with your beautiful lotus feet that grew into the sky.
      Won’t the time come soon when I can call you and join you?

3440. Pleasures in the world may shrink or grow,
      they may go away, the world may end and again arise,
      but O Māyon, even if I join you for a little time
      that is much better than all the happiness I can get in this world.
      I do not know when that time will come.

3441. Saḍagopan, the devotee of the devotees
      of the devotees of dear Thirumāl
      who know and think only of him

      are the form of the five elements
      fire, land, water. fire and wind.
      You who killed all the strong cruel Rakshasa tribes
      and burned their lands
      are the lord of Thiruvenkaṭam
      where lotuses red as fire bloom from the mud in springs,
      and my love for you is limitless.
      Give me your grace and bring me to your feet.

3444. O my father, highest one,
      beautiful cloud-colored Māyan who enchant everyone,
      you, sweet nectar and lord of the gods with unblinking eyes,
      have entered my thoughts,
      O god of Thiruvenkaṭam
      where a clear waterfalls descends beautifully
      scattering diamonds, gold and pearls.
      O highest one, give me your grace and bring me to your feet.

3445. O divine god, beloved of Lakshmi lord of Thiruvenkaṭam
      where sages and the gods in the sky love to worship you
      you shot fiery arrows like rain
      and killed the Asurans who troubled people in the forest.
      I have done bad karma.
      Give me your grace and bring me to your ankleted lotus feet.

3446. You are the mighty one who, shooting one arrow,
      destroyed the seven trees that were joined together,
      the ancient one who went between the Asurans
      when they came as two trees.
      You stay in Thiruvenkaṭam where a herd of strong elephants
      looks like a group of clouds,
      and you carry the mighty bow Charngam.
      When will I, your devotee, truly join your feet?

3447. You are the god of Thiruvenkaṭam
      where the gods in the sky come, praise and worship
      with their bodies, tongues and minds, saying,
      “When will the day come when we see
      the lotus feet that measured the world?”
      When will the day truly come
      when I, your devotee, come and join your feet?

3448. You are my nectar.
      and I, your devotee, enjoy worshipping you,
      the lord of the gods with an eagle flag.
      O highest one, with a beautiful mouth as sweet as a fruit,
      you, the god of Thiruvenkaṭam, are the remedy for cruel karma.
      I suffer wanting to see your feet every moment
      and I cannot bear it.

3449. Dark-necked Shiva, faultless Nānmuhan, Indra
      and beautiful fish-eyed women
      join together in Thiruvenkaṭam
      and worship you, saying “We cannot wait to see your feet!”
      You came to the earth as Maal and fascinated everyone.
      Won’t you come to us
      just as you have always come to the world?

3450. It seems as if you are coming,
      but you do not come to me.
      It seems you are not coming, but you do come to me.
      You who have lovely lotus eyes
      and a red mouth like sweet fruit or nectar are my life,
      the god of Thiruvenkaṭam
      where chintamaṇi jewels turn night into day.
      Alas, I am your slave
      and cannot be away from your feet even for a moment.

3451. You who rule all three worlds,
      my king, the lord of Thiruvenkaṭam
      loved by the matchless gods and sages,
      embrace Lakshmi who says,
      “I will not go away from you even for a moment.”
      Nothing compares to your fame.
      I, your slave with no other refuge,
      have come to you to sit beneath your feet.

3452. Sadagopan of Thirukuruhur flourishing with paddy fields
      composed a thousand pāsurams on the matchless lord
      of Thiruvenkaṭam who gives his grace, saying,
      “Come and sit beneath my feet and you will be saved.”
      If devotees learn and recite these ten pāsurams
      they will become the devotees of his devotees
      and reach and abide in moksha in the wide sky.

3453. You are the Māyan—no one knows who you are.
      You, the ruler of the three worlds praised by the gods,
      the nectar, my father, and my ruler
      are still intent on giving my body
      the feelings of the five senses even though they hurt me
      and do not let me reach your lotus feet.

3454. O dark cloud-colored lord,
      as sweet as sugarcane juice, divine nectar,
      lord of the Vedas with a shining discus
      that protects the world surrounded by oceans,
      you make my five senses rule me,
      hurting me night and day and attacking my goodness
      so I am unable to come to you.

3455. You, the ancient god adorned with a shining crown
      who created this wide world, swallowed it and spit it out,
      are the shining lord took the form of a boar
      and split open the ground and brought up the earth goddess
      when an Asuran took and hid her.
      Alas! What do you get by making the five senses hurt me
      and increasing my bad karma,
      preventing me from reaching your divine feet?
      O Madhusudana, I am your devotee.

3456. You contain all things and creatures of the world
      in your stomach and sleep on a banyan leaf as a child.
      See, you made my five senses hurt me
      and I could not reach your flower-like feet.
      I have done bad karma.
      and you are the remedy that can relieve me of my karma.

3457. O god of the gods in the sky
      who destroyed the terrible tribe of the Asurans with your heroic discus,
      you make the five senses hurt me
      and I do not know any remedy to counter the pain they give.
      Who can relieve me of that pain?

3458. You are the highest lord,
      and are in music, in poetry, and the devotion of devotees.
      I just live in this world—how could five senses
      that hurt even the devotees of the lord of the sky
      not hurt me if you do not worry about me?
      You are in my heart and in my eyes.
      Speak to me and tell me something
      to be rid of the feelings that the five senses give me.

3459. O father, when the gods could not churn
      the milky ocean with its roaring waves
      you helped them and churned it with them
      using the snake Vasuki and Mandara mountain.
      I am wicked and you are the nectar that I can drink.
      Unless you give me your grace,
      how can I conquer the five senses,
      the thieves that make me unstable?

3460. Give me your grace to worship your form
      and your discus, conch and club.
      You are the three gods, Shiva, Nānmuhan and Indra,
      my mother, my dear one,
      and the source of the gods in the sky.
      Before, you gave me the pleasures of the five senses
      and fascinated me with your magic
      but now you come as sweet nectar and utterly remove
      all the joy of my senses.

3461. You who are a highest light, the god Kaṇṇan,
      created all the worlds and the creatures
      that stand and move and all other things.
      You gave me a boon to destroy
      the pleasures of the five senses and bad karma they give
      that can destroy everyone in a family.

3462. You gave me the task of melting in love for you
      and worshiping your lotus feet,
      crying and saying, “You are the highest light!”
      The five senses stand everywhere and threaten me,
      O lord who churned the milky ocean and took nectar from it.

3463. Saḍagopan, a devotee of the devotees of the devotees
      of the devotees of the lord
      who creates the world, protects it and destroys it
      composed a thousand pāsurams on the god,
      our father who has three forms, Shiva, Nānmuhan and Indra,
      and on whose navel Nānmuhan stays on a lotus.
      If devotees learn and recite these ten pāsurams
      they will have no results of their karma, day or night.

3464. Her mother worries and says,
      “My daughter doesn’t sleep night or day.
      With her fingers, she wipes away the tears that drip from her eyes.
      She folds her hands, worships and says, ‘Conch and discus!’
      Tired, she says, ‘He has lotus eyes!’
      She says, ‘How can I survive without you?’
      and with her hands, she searches all over for you,
      O god of Thiruvarangam
      with abundant water where lovely kayal fish frolic,
      what did you do to make her like this?”

3465. Her mother worries and says,
      “ My daughter says,
      ‘You are my lotus-eyed Kaṇṇan. Why do you do this to me?’
      Her eyes fill with tears and she says,
      ‘You are the lord of Thiruvarangam
      surrounded by the ocean roaring with waves.
      What will I do?’ and she sighs and melts.
      She says, ‘I have done much bad karma
      and that is why you don’t come before me.
      Is that right?’
      O lord who swallowed the world and spat it out,
      what will happen to her?”

3466. Her mother worries and says,
      “My daughter doesn’t feel ashamed at all.
      She says, ‘You have the color of blue sapphire.’
      She looks at the sky and, fascinated, and she says,
      ‘You are unique and you destroyed
      the Asurans who gave fear to all people.’
      Her heart melts and she says, ‘No one can see you.
      Give me your grace so I may see you
      who are Rama of the Kahusta dynasty and Kaṇṇan.’
      O you who stay in Thiruvarangam
      surrounded by walls where flags fly,
      what did you do to fascinate her?”

3467. Her mother worries and says,
      “My daughter stays in one place
      without moving her hands and legs.
      Sometime she gets up and walks around.
      Fascinated with someone,
      she folds her hands in worship,
      says, ‘Love is trouble’ and sighs.
      In her delusion, she says, ‘You have the color of the ocean.
      See, you how difficult you are, you with the round discus in your left hand.
      Come to me.’
      You, a sage, stay in Thiruvarangam surrounded by flourishing water.
      What do you think you are doing to her?”

3468. Her mother worries and says,
      “My daughter, lost in thought,
      folds her hands, worships all the directions
      and says, ‘You stay in Thiruvarangam.’
      Her eyes fill with tears. Fascinated by you,
      she worships you and says, ‘Come to me.’
      She says, ‘Once, in the evening,
      you split open the body of Hiraṇyan.
      You are the sweet nectar that was churned
      from the milky ocean rolling with waves.’
      She thinks only you are her refuge and lives for you
      who have made her fall in love with you.”

3469. Her mother worries and says,
      “My daughter says,
      ‘He fascinated me and attracted my mind.’
      She says, ‘You are a real Māyan,
      a diamond and your red mouth is beautiful.’
      She says, ‘You stay in Thiruvarangam surrounded by cool water.’
      She says, ‘You are the ancient god of gods in the sky
      and you carry a strong sword, club, conch, discus and a bow.’
      O god who rest on Ādisesha, give her your grace.
      This is the only thing I ask you.”

3470. Her mother worries and says,
      “My daughter says,
      ‘You created sorrow and happiness,
      you are desire for those who have no desire,
      you carry the discus that destroys those who are evil,
      and you, Kaṇṇan, have the color of the ocean
      and rest on the ocean,’
      and she says, ‘You, my sacred temple, stay in Thiruvarangam
      surrounded by water where fish frolic.’
      She is my lovely daughter, soft as a tender shoot
      and her beautiful eyes are filled with tears.”

3471. Her mother worries and says,
      “My daughter says,
      ‘He who carried Govardhana mountain and protected the cows
      is a tender shoot for the gods in the sky.’
      She cries for him and worships him
      and her sighs are hot as fire.
      She says, ‘You have the color of kohl.’
      She just looks up without even blinking her eyes
      and says, ‘Where should I look to find you?’
      O lord of Thiruvarangam
      surrounded by flourishing ponds filled with water,
      what should I do for my lovely daughter?”

3472. Her mother worries and says,
      “My daughter says,
      ‘You embrace lovely Lakshmi on your chest.
      You are my life, the beloved of the earth goddess
      whom you brought up from the underworld
      taking the form of a boar and splitting open the earth.’
      She says, ‘You conquered seven bulls
      to marry the cowherd girl Nappinnai
      and you are her beloved husband.’
      O lord of the temple of south Thiruvarangam,
      I don’t understand what will happen to my daughter.”

3473. Her mother worries and says,
      “My daughter says,
      ‘I don’t see any end to my suffering.
      You are the ruler of all the three worlds,
      you are Shiva, whose matted hair is adorned with fragrant kondrai flowers,
      Nanmuhan and the lord of the beautiful the gods in the sky.’
      She says, ‘You stay in flourishing Thiruvarangam.’
      She was not able to approach his feet
      but now she has reached the feet of the cloud-colored god.”

3474. Sadagopan of Thirukuruhur on the bank of a river
      with abundant blue water surrounded by flourishing groves
      composed a garland of a thousand pāsurams
      on the feet of the cloud-colored god.
      If devotees learn these ten poems and recite them
      they will reach the blue sky with clouds
      and stay with the god in a flood of bliss.

3475. Her daughter says,
      “O mothers, the lotus-eyed god Kaṇṇan
      carrying a curved white conch and a discus
      entered my heart riding on Garuḍa.
      How can I describe how it was?
      The sound of the parrots, the divine sound of the Vedas,
      the loud noise of festivals
      and the sound of children’s play
      never stop in Thiruppereyil.
      When will I go and reach that place
      where the god stays giving his grace like a flood.”

3476. Her daughter says,
      “O my friends with dark, fragrant hair,
      O mothers, O people of the village,
      I cannot keep my heart with me.
      It has gone from me to Kaṇṇan
      and stays with him night and day,
      and I cannot bear being alone without my heart.
      He stays in southern Thiruppereyil
      filled with cool fields and blooming groves swarming with bees.
      My heart has fallen for the beauty of the sweet fruit-like mouth
      of the sapphire-colored lord of the gods in the sky.”

3477. Her daughter says,
      “O my friends, my heart rejoices!
      It has fallen for the beauty of the sweet fruit-like mouth,
      the long shining hair, the conch and discus and the lotus eyes
      of the one who stays in southern Thirupperur
      where festivals go on every day of every month.
      My heart has lost its modesty and chastity for our lord.”

3478. Her daughter says,
      “O mothers,
      my heart went to him to bring back the dark color that I lost,
      but it stays there with him.
      Who can I send to find out what has happened to it?
      The lord carrying the sounding conch in his hands
      stays in southern Thirupperiyil
      where the recitation the good Vedas spreads everywhere
      like the roaring sound of the ocean.
      I fell into his māyam. O mothers, what is the use of getting mad at me?”

3479. She says,
      “O mothers, our lord Kaṇṇan grew angry at Sakatasuran
      when he came as a cart and kicked and destroyed him,
      he drank milk from the breasts of the devil Putana,
      went between the two Raksasas when they came as marudu trees and killed them,
      and he threw the Raksasa who came in the form of a calf
      onto the other Raksasa who had taken the form of a vilam tree
      and killed both.
      O mothers, I have lost my chastity to him.
      You are angry at me—what will you do?
      He stays in Thiruppereyil where sweet fruits ripen in the groves.
      Take me there and leave me. Don’t wait.”

3480. Her daughter says,
      “ O mothers! My love is larger than the ocean.
      The dark cloud-colored god came to me
      but I couldn’t catch him who was so dear with my hands.
      Don’t wait too long.
      Take me to Thiruppereyil surrounded by water
      where the ruler of the world stays
      and the sound of the Vediyars reciting the four Vedas
      and performing sacrifices spreads without ceasing everywhere
      while paddy plants flourish waving in the wind.”

3481. Her daughter says,
      “O friend, the lord of Thirupereyil
      who destroyed Lanka in the south
      surrounded by large forts and the ocean
      entered my heart but I haven’t seen him for a long time now.
      O my friend, who is there to help me?
      No one is strong enough to call the god to my heart.
      How can I find anyone to do what I want?
      My heart thinks whatever it knows is the right thing.”

3482. Her daughter says,
      “O friend, when people see me,
      they get together and gossip about the love I have
      for the dark ocean-colored lord.
      Why should I worry about their gossip?
      My love for him is larger than this world filled with sand
      and the seven oceans and the wide sky.
      I will go to southern Thirupereyil
      surrounded by the ocean with its clear waves.”

3483. Her daughter says,
      “O friends, mothers, I will go there and stay—
      don’t try to convince me to stay here.
      Why do you want to stop me?
      My heart and my chastity don’t want to stay here.
      He, the dark ocean-colored lord Kaṇṇan
      who swallowed the world surrounded by the dark ocean
      stays in wonderful southern Thiruppereyil
      filled with flourishing paddy fields plowed by farmers.”

3484. Her daughter says,
      “ O friends, I will go to all towns and lands to find him,
      I am not ashamed at all.
      The god Makaraneḍumguzhaikkādar,
      the god on the earth for many eons,
      the Māyan who destroyed the Kauravas,
      the enemies of the Pāndavas,
      who has the color of a cloud and carries a matchless discus
      has taken my heart.”

3485. Sadagopan of beautiful Thirukkuruhur
      composed a thousand anthadi pāsurams on Achudan,
      the ocean-colored god
      who protects the earth and has many names,
      forms and deeds in every eon.
      If devotees learn these ten poems
      that praise the god of Thiruppereyil
      who holds a discus in his hand
      they will become his slaves.

3486. When he took the form of Thirivikraman
      and measured the world,
      his discus, his conch, his bow, his club and sword
      all appeared and everyone praised him everywhere.
      Our father’s head touched the sky
      and his feet touched the earth.
      This is the way the world and the eons appeared. CHECK

3487. At the time when our father
      churned the milky ocean to take the nectar,
      the sound of many rivers that are born in the mountains
      and fall down to the earth
      and the sound of the churning of the ocean with Mandara mountain
      and the loud sound of the snake Vasuki all spread everywhere.

3488. At the time our father
      took the form of a boar and split open the earth,
      the seven worlds stayed where they were without moving,
      the seven mountains stayed without shaking
      and the seven oceans did not rise and were still.

3489. When the world was ending
      our father swallowed the seven worlds,
      the oceans, the lands, the sky, the stars,
      fire, mountains, wind, moon and sun,
      protected them in his stomach,
      and when he spit them out
      everything in the world appeared again.

3490. At the time when our father
      fought in the Bharatha war,
      the sound of the strong warriors being killed,
      the sound of the trembling of the army,
      and the sound of all the gods
      as they came to see what was happening
      spread all over the world.

3491. When our father took the form of a man-lion,
      and fought with Hiraṇyan and killed him
      the red blood that came from the Asuran’s body
      looked like the red sky when the sun sets
      and the lord looked like a lion that came out of a mountain
      that had split apart.

3492. When our father fought in Lanka
      and killed the Raksasas,
      the arrows were piled up everywhere
      and a flood of blood flowed like a river or an ocean.
      The bodies of the hundreds of elephants that were killed
      piled up like a mountain.

3493. When Vānasuran who came to fight with the god
      lost the war and our father cut off his thousand strong arms,
      Murugan carrying a rooster flag,
      Agni, the god of fire
      and Shiva with an eye on his forehead
      who had come to help the Asuran
      and were all defeated in the battle.

3494. Our father created the earth,
      oceans, fire, wind, sky, mountains,
      sun, moon, rain, all creatures and things in the world
      and the gods in the sky.
      Everything in the world is only his creation.

3495. When there was a storm
      and the rain pounded down and the wind blew
      and the water in the springs increased and overflowed
      and the cattle that were grazing were terrified,
      our father carried Govardana mountain as an umbrella
      and protected the cows
      and they all hid under the mountain and were saved.

3496. Sadagopan, the devotee of our god,
      composed a thousand good pāsurams on our father,
      describing how the lord carried Govardhana mountain
      to protect the cows and cowherds.
      If devotees learn and recite these ten pāsurams
      they will be successful in all their endeavors.

3497. In this world that was created by Nānmuhan
      Rama gave his grace to everything,
      from the ants to the grass,
      and all the creatures and things in Ayodhya,
      that move and do not move.
      If the devotees want to learn the stories of the gods,
      will they learn any other story about them except Rama’s?

3498. At the time when the Rakshasas
      afflicted the people of many lands,
      our lord was born on the earth, suffered for humankind,
      searched for the Rakshasas, destroyed them
      and saved the people and gave them back their lands.
      Could anyone become the devotee of any other god
      after hearing of his heroic deeds?

3499. Kaṇṇan destroyed Sisupalan
      but gave his grace to that Asuran
      even though he had said many evil things about the lord
      that hurt the ears of listeners.
      When his devotees hear the compassion of the lord
      they will praise only him.
      If the people hear the story of Sisupalan
      and how he reached the feet of the lord through the god’s compassion,
      they will not want to hear the fame of any gods other than our Kesavan.

3500. In ancient times before the eon when there was nothing,
      the god created the good waters and Nānmuhan,
      the creator of the creatures of the world.
      Wise men do not become the devotees of any gods but Kaṇṇan
      if they have learned how he created
      the ancient world when the eon began.

3501. At the time of pralaya
      when the earth was submerged under the deep ocean,
      our god did not hesitate to take the form of a boar
      and bring the earth up from the underworld on one tusk.
      If anyone knows and understands this story of the boar,
      will he worship any god but the feet of the ankleted Māyan?

3502. Mahābali received abundant power
      because he was so generous to all,
      and he grew arrogant and afflicted the gods.
      When the gods went to the lord and asked for help
      the lord took the form of a dwarf and went to Mahābali,
      begged him for three feet of land,
      and measured the earth and the sky with his two feet,
      freeing the gods from the suffering Mahābali had given them.
      If devotees hear and understand his play,
      how he extended his hands
      and begged for land from king Mahābali,
      they will not become the devotees of any god but Kesavan.

3503. When Shiva with matted hair promised Markandeyan
      who wore flower garlands swarming with bees
      that he would save him from Yama,
      he saved him as he had promised and took him to our god,
      and Kaṇṇan gave Markandeyan everlasting moksha.
      If devotees know and learn this story of Markandeya
      they will not become the devotees of any god except Kaṇṇan.

3504. When Hiraṇyan performed limitless tapas and received many boons
      and caused much distress to the gods with his power,
      our lord came as a strong man-lion to the earth
      and tore open the chest of the Raksasa Hiraṇyan.
      If devotees know the magical power of our lord,
      they will not wish to learn anything except the excellence
      of our precious Kaṇṇan.

3505. The whole country knows that when the hundred Kauravas
      took everything the Paṇḍavas had by gambling and cheating them,
      Kaṇṇan went as a charioteer for Arjuna
      and destroyed the Karuravas’ army on the battlefield.
      If devotees know what happened in the Bharatha war,
      will they become the devotee of any god
      other than Māyavan, the god with magical power?

3506. He removes the troubles
      of birth, sickness, old age and death for his devotees
      and makes them join his feet and protects them.
      If devotees understand his compassion
      will they become the slave of any other god than Māyavan?

3507. Sadagopan of southern Thirukkuruhur
      composed a thousand pure pāsurams on Kaṇṇan.
      If devotees believe that Kaṇṇan will surely give them moksha,
      he will give them the land of everlasting happiness,
      and if they learn and recite these ten pāsurams
      they will become devotees with faultless minds
      in all the three worlds.

3508. Are you Padmanābhan?
      Did you create the three worlds?
      Did you measure the world and the sky
      with your lotus feet as a dwarf ?
      Are you the lotus-eyed Kaṇṇan?
      Are your hands as beautiful as lotuses?
      I am alone. When will I come and join you?

3509. You are our father
      who contain in your body
      the earth, water, fire, wind and sky
      that you have created — you are all of them.
      You are a dancer and you grazed the cows
      and protected them from the storm
      by carrying Govardhana mountain as an umbrella.
      Alas! When will I reach your divine feet
      that are praised by Shiva and Nānmuhan?

3510. You, the dancer with a cool thulasi garland and flowers in your hair
      who carried Govardhana mountain
      to protect the cows from the storm
      and who are Shiva wearing kondrai flowers in his matted hair
      and Nānmuhan the creator of the world
      came to me and became my dear life.
      When can I join you
      whose unlimited fame is praised by all.

3511. Where will I get to see you,
      the cowherd adorned with a cool blooming thulasi garland
      dripping with honey?
      You are the beautiful three worlds,
      the three-eyed highest Shiva and Nānmuhan,
      Indra with the heroic shining vajrayudam in his hand
      and the other gods in the sky.

3512. You are my mischievous cowherd, my dark diamond,
      the three worlds that were created by Nānmugan
      who stays on the lotus on your navel,
      a flood of light and my dear life.
      How can I find you in my heart and join you?

3513. I do not know how to reach the bright sapphire-colored lord
      who, with his shining feet, navel, hands, chest, eyes and mouth
      is as beautiful as a ruby
      as he stays with Lakshmi (with a dark diamond?) CHECK
      who sits on a blooming lotus on his divine chest
      wearing a red silk garment.

3514. On his navel is Nānmuhan, the beloved of the goddess of education
      and he is the lord of Indra who is the beloved of Indrani.
      Won’t I see him, the ruler of the sky
      who split open the earth to bring back the earth goddess
      and burned the three forts
      and who keeps beautiful Lakshmi on his divine chest
      while his body contains Shiva who shares half of it
      with Girija the daughter of the Himalayas?

3515. When he came to attack Lanka
      the Raksasas ran and hid in caves,
      looking like horses terrified at seeing a Yāli
      or like foxes that, seeing a lion, run screaming and hide.
      He flew on Garuda, fought and killed Māli
      and the other Raksasas so their bodies were piled up like hills.
      When will I see my lord?

3516. O heart, when can I see Rāma, the lion among the gods
      who destroyed the heroic lion-like Raksasa clan
      whose deeds were cruel
      and gave the kingdom of Lanka surrounded by the oceans
      to Rāvana’s brother Vibhishana before going back to Ayodhya,
      ruling the kingdom many years
      and finally going to the illustrious heaven in the sky?

3517. The mighty Kaṇṇan who is the highest divine light
      will give us moksha in Vaikuṇḍam, hard to reach.
      Raised as young child in a family of cowherds
      where he did many magical deeds,
      he killed Kamsan, as cruel as Yama,
      and fought with the terrible Kaurava army to help the five Pāndavas

3518. Saḍagopan composed a thousand pāsurams
      on the god with a discus who took the form of a lion
      and split open the body of the Asuran Hiraṇyan.
      If devotees learn these ten pāsurams and recite them
      they will be in heaven where beautiful women fan them
      and sing “Pallāṇḍu!”

3519. Her daughter says,
      “Are his two eyes Yamas
      that have come to take away the life of me,
      a poor women? I don’t know.
      Or are they the divine eyes of the lord Kaṇṇan
      who carries a shining discus? I don’t know.
      See, two things come and appear
      like fresh blooming lotuses before me.
      O my friends, mothers,
      what will I do? I suffer.”

3520. Her daughter says,
      “O mothers, what is the use of blaming me and scolding me?
      You just make me worry more.
      The divine nose of Kaṇṇan who ate so much butter
      entered my soul and shines like a bright light,
      but I’m not sure whether it is really his nose
      or a tall Karpaga creeper or a tender shoot.”

3521. Her daughter says,
      “Are his lips as red as a kovvai fruit?
      Are they lovely round coral stones?
      Have I done too much bad karma? I don’t know.
      The mouth sweet as a thondai fruit
      of the blue cloud-colored god
      appears everywhere in front of me
      and threatens my dear life.”

3522. Her daughter says,
      “Are the eyebrows of the lord two blue bent bows
      that take away the precious lives of lovely girls?
      Or are they the sugarcane bows
      of famous, everlasting Kama, the god of love?
      The eyebrows of the lord, the dear father of Kama,
      come to me and burn my precious heart and body.”

3523. Her daughter says,
      “Is the smile of the lord shining white lightning in the red sky?
      Are his teeth beautiful pearls that take away my life?
      I do not know.
      The smile of the lord who carried the Govardhana hills kills me.
      O mothers! I don’t know where I can go to survive.”

3524. Her daughter says,
      “See, the divine ears of the lord rests on a snake bed,
      adorned with beautiful earrings, ask,
      ‘What place is safe for the innocent girls who love the god,
      and what place is safe for the Asurans and the Raksasas
      from the god who is their enemy?’
      Those tender shoot-like ears burn me without stopping.”

3525. Her daughter says,
      “O mother, see,
      I don’t know any way to show you how I suffer from love.
      Is the white moon that rises every day
      poison for those who love someone?
      The divine forehead of the lord
      who has four beautiful strong arms
      takes away my life.
      Surely I have done bad karma.”

3526. Her daughter says,
      “Is the round circle of his faultless shining face
      a fresh-petaled lotus with a vine inside it,
      along with a coral, a bow, cool beautiful pearls,
      tender shoots and the cool crescent moon in the sky?
      It comes before me and kills me.
      I have done bad karma.”

3527. Her daughter says,
      “O mothers, is his hair a bundle of black threads,
      with luxurious curls parting the darkness with its stars?
      The beautiful sound of the flute of Maayan
      adorned with a fresh cool thulasi garland
      comes spreading fragrance and steals my dear life.
      You don’t understand my trouble,
      you just stand there and scold me.”

3528. Her daughter says,
      “He enters my yard holding his hands together,
      and circles around me.
      My heart has fallen in love with the bright crown
      of the dark shining diamond-colored lord
      that spreads its light in all the three worlds.
      O mothers, what do you want me to do?”

3529. Saḍagopan of Thirukkuruhur
      composed a thousand poems
      on the dark-colored Kaṇṇan
      whom even Nānmuhan, Shiva and Indra cannot see.
      If devotees learn and recite these ten pāsurams
      they will go to the sky and stay with the everlasting gods
      and will never die.

3530. You are Māyan, Vāmanan and Madhusudhanan,
      and even though you are fire, water, land, sky and the wind,
      our mother, father, our children and all other things in the world,
      you are yourself different than all of them.
      Look—is this fair? What kind of justice is this?
      Give us your grace.

3531. O lord Achuda adorned with a cool blooming thulasi garland,
      is it not a wonder that you are the moon, sun, bright day, night,
      pouring rain, fame and disgrace and the cruel strong Yama?
      Give us your grace.

3532. You are all the yugas
      and, carrying a divine discus,
      you drove the beautiful chariot in the Bharatha war.
      Even though you are everything that is in the world,
      and you make all things function
      and make all things have the same nature,
      you are clever and also make them different.
      What kind of similarities and differences are these?
      Give us your grace.

3533. O lord Kaṇṇan with eyes as beautiful as lotuses that drip honey
      who rest on a snake bed on the large watery ocean in a yogic trance,
      you are what is and what is not
      and things that move and things and that do not.
      What kind of tricks are these?
      Give me your grace.

3534.O Mayava, give me your grace
so I may leave all desires and be only your devotee.
You who wear fragrant flowers
and a fresh thulasi garland in your hair
cause me to be born in this world with a body and life
and keep me here with your māyam.
What are these tricks?

3435. You who took the form of a dwarf,
      confuse us by being weariness and wakefulness,
      fire and cold, wonders and victories, karma and its results.
      Why do you give us all this confusion?
      Give me the knowledge of knowing you.

3536. O Kaṇṇan with long shining hair,
      you are the source of the desires that make us sad,
      the body that we suffer with
      the passions that we have,
      and past, present, and future.
      Is this all your play?
      Give us your grace.

3537. O Kaṇṇan, our ruler, you play many games
      but what do you gain from them?
      No one knows who you are.
      You created all the three worlds and everything in them
      and you are both in them and outside them.
      What is this nature of yours?

3538. O my Kaṇṇan, what is your nature? Where are you?
      You are all parts of us, our hands and legs,
      taste, sight, feeling, sound and smell.
      If we want to know all the things that you are
      they are so tiny there is no limit to them.

3539. The ancient, excellent sastras describe your good nature—
      there is nothing better than they to describe
      who are form and formlessness,
      and wear a thulasi garland with alli flowers on your chest.
      O Achuda, if any sastras describe the nature of any other god
      the nature they describe is only yours.

3540. Saḍagopan of Thirukuruhur
      composed a thousand beautiful Tamil pāsurams
      on the lord whose nature no one knows.
      If devotees learn and recite beautifully
      these ten Tamil pāsurams on the nature of the lord
      they will be always his dear devotees.

3541. He took me as his devotee forever,
      and after he had made me his,
      he made me compose sweet Tamil pāsurams
      praising him, the ancient lord, the shining light.
      What can I say to worship him?

3542. What should I say?
      The Māyan, the first among the three gods and my sweet life
      made me compose poems with words that were really his words.
      He made me famous
      because all people think that I composed these poems,
      but all the words I say are his.

3543. Thinking I am a good poet, he entered my tongue
      and made me compose these sweet pāsurams for his faultless devotees.
      He himself composed them,
      praising himself through my poems.
      He is my father. How could I forget him?

3544. He himself composed faultless poems
      about himself through me.
      Though I have done many things too wicked to describe,
      he himself is me and I know he saved me
      giving me his grace and making me a good poet.
      How could I forget my father?

3545. The highest lord understood that I,
      a low one, have no ability to compose sweet poems.
      He joined me with himself,
      and composed wonderful poems
      that are praised by the whole world.

3546. The divine lord of Vaikuṇṭam does not compose
      sweet poems himself on himself.
      He came to me lovingly
      and made me compose poems about him,
      singing beautiful poems on himself through me.

3547. The lord of Vaikuṇṭam destroyed my bad karma
      and made me a good person.
      He made me compose sweet poems
      that describe him as the lord of Vaikuṇṭam and praise him.
      My mind will not be satisfied
      even if I praise him forever in sweet poems.

3548. I am not fit to compose poems on him
      who carries a discus in his beautiful hands,
      but he joined me with himself
      and gave me the ability to compose sweet poems about him.
      Even if someone puts together the world, sky and water
      and praises the lord, it is not sufficient for the fame of the lord.

3549. He accepted me as his devotee
      and gave me his grace to compose many sweet pāsurams on him
      and did not forget me.
      Even if I praise his past, present and future virtue
      and enjoy it, it is not enough to praise him truly.
      How can I repay him for his help?

3550. Even if I wanted to give him my life
      for the things he has done for me it would not be enough
      because he who composed sweet pāsurams on himself through me
      created me and my life is his.
      I do not have anything to give to my father in return
      in this world or in the sky
      for the things that he has done for me.

3551. Sadagopan of flourishing Thirukkuruhur
      who knows that there is no place
      where the lord does not exist
      and that he is omnipresent
      composed a thousand pāsurams on the lord.
      Wherever devotees stay,
      however they recite these ten poems,
      they will obtain the joy of reaching the god.

3552. When will the day come when I can go to Thiruvāṛanviḷai
      surrounded with beautiful groves
      and circle around the hill and worship him,
      where the lord stays happily with Lakshmi, seated on a beautiful lotus,
      ruling this world while both give happiness to all?

3553. The lord who, taking the form of a divine dwarf,
      measured the wide world and the sky with his two feet
      stays in Thiruvāṛanviḷai surrounded by tall walls
      and filled with palaces where shining flags fly and touch the sky.
      When will the time come that I can go there
      with fragrant water and sprinkle it
      and circle the hill and worship him folding my hands?

3554. Will I be able to worship him every day, going to Thiruvāṛanviḷai
      where Govindan, Madhusudhanan, the man-lion stays
      riding on Garudan, surrounded with tall groves
      where Vediyars recite the four famous Vedas
      and six Upanishads and perform sacrifices.

3555. Will I be able to go and worship his lotus feet every day
      just as I worship in my heart here the famous Kanṇapirān,
      the sapphire-colored god of all the three worlds,
      who was born in northern Madura
      and stays in Thiruvāṛanviḷai
      surrounded by sugarcane and good paddy lands?

3556. My father who rests on a snake bed
      and gives his grace to many devotees,
      stays in Thiruvāṛanviḷai surrounded by tall walls
      and high palaces studded with jewels and flowers.
      If I keep his lotus-like feet in my heart always,
      worship him and sing his fame that spreads in all the worlds,
      all my karma will be destroyed and go away.

3557. I worship the lord who fought with Sisupalan,
      and brought Rukmani, embracing her lovely round arms,
      the god of beautiful Thiruvāṛanvilai who is in my heart all days and all times.
      O devotees, if you praise his fame, so abundantly praised by the world,
      all your bad karma will go away.

3558. When Neḍumāl, Kaṇṇan, the king of the gods in the sky,
      went to the kingdom of Vāṇan, fought a cruel war with the Asuran
      and cut off his thousand arms,
      three-eyed Shiva and his son Kārthikeya came to help Vānan
      but they retreated and ran from the battlefield.
      There is no other refuge than the feet of the god
      of flourishing Thiruvāṛanviḷai
      surrounded by groves blooming with flowers.

3559. When the elephant Gajendra stood on the bank of the pond,
      worshiped his divine ankleted feet and called him saying,
      “There is no refuge for me but you,”
      the lord went there, saved him from the crocodile
      and removed his affliction.
      He stays majestically in Thiruvāṛanviḷai
      surrounded by flourishing groves.
      If you go there and circle the hill
      the bad karma that troubles your mind will go away.

3560. Even if my bad karma is removed
      and I am able to go to heaven
      I will only want to go to Thiruvaṛanviḷai
      surrounded with groves
      where all the devotees come and worship him
      with their tongues, hearts and all their actions.
      My heart suffers not knowing when I will be able to go,
      circle the hill there and worship him.

3561. The god of the gods knows that a person’s heart
      does not leave the thoughts it has,
      and there is nothing magical that one cannot achieve
      if he always thinks of that one thing.
      There is nothing that I cannot achieve
      after I give myself to the god of Thiruvāṛanviḷai
      where the gods come to the earth and praise him
      with their minds and deeds.

3562. Saḍagopan from the flourishing southern Thirukkuruhur,
      giving his mind to the Theerthan
      and thinking that there is no other refuge except his feet,
      composed a thousand pāsurams with a pure mind on him.
      Even the gods worship the devotees
      who learn and recite these ten poems
      and tell their dear wives about them.

3563. O lord, shining jewel, with lotus eyes that kill me
      and a coral mouth that shines, you are my life,
      and you are the sweet nectar that you, my father, churned
      and took from the milky ocean roaring with waves.
      The divine Lakshmi and other goddesses obey you and serve you
      and your form rules all the three worlds which depend on you.
      I am your slave and I have done bad karma.
      Give me your grace—I long to see you.

3564. I have done bad karma.
      My eyes fill with tears, I worry and say,
      “Come and give me your grace so that I can see you!”
      and I prattle on saying only your names.
      O Kaṇṇan, I am the slave of you
      who are the fruit of the Karpaga tree,
      nectar for those who worship you,
      the generous lord who took the form of a boar,
      split open the ground and brought up the earth goddess
      surrounded by oceans from the underworld.
      O Kakutstha, give me your grace—I long to see you.

3565. O, you bright little elephant cub for Yasodha
      and great joy for cowherd families,
      raised as the small child of generous Nandagopan
      and as dear to him as his life,
      you are a beloved mother for me your slave,
      an ocean of strength,
      and the strong man-lion who split with your claws
      the body of the Asuran Hiraṇyan when he came to fight with you.
      Come in another form for us
      and we, your devotees, and the gods will be happy.

3566. O you who are my dear life,
      nectar for the gods in the sky and poison for the Asurans,
      my father who fought with the Kauravas
      and conquered their murderous army,
      the gods love you and became your friends,
      and you took various forms to make them happy..
      They do their deeds only through your māya.

3567. You are my dear life,
      the great lord who created the world, broke it,
      swallowed it, spat it out and measured it.
      You, the magnificent lord, created the milky ocean
      and churned it, and you rest on it on a snake bed.
      You are the god of the gods
      and the excellent life of the whole world.
      Where can I come to see you?

3568. Where will I find you, my ruler?
      You are formless, you are truth and sincerity,
      all the seven worlds, all the things
      that the gods or anyone want you to be,
      and all the actions that people do.
      If there is anything beyond all these things, that is also you.
      You are everything in the sky and above the sky.

3569. You are ghee made of fresh milk and its taste,
      the nectar that comes from the ocean and its sweet taste,
      the generous god who married Nappinnai and embraced her arms.
      You are past, present and future.
      I do not know whether your excellent nature
      is this, that, or in between. I have done bad karma.

3570. O cowherd who married Nappinnai,
      I have done bad karma
      but you attracted me with your excellent nature.
      You, the god of the milky ocean and a Yama for your enemies,
      fought with the strong-handed Asurans,
      raising your heroic eagle flag,
      and you rest on the thousand-headed snake Adishesha.
      I do not know how to worship you.
      My mind, words, deeds and I myself—all are you.

3571. I am indeed you. It is true
      that whatever there is in the world is yours,
      and if you yourself are evil hell
      then whether I reach the pleasures of heaven
      or go to hell, what difference does it make?
      Even though I know I am you,
      I am still afraid of going to hell.
      You stay forever in the heaven that gives joy.
      Give me the grace of reaching your feet.

3572. You have a thousand arms, a thousand heads,
      a thousand beautiful lotus eyes,
      a thousand feet and a thousand names.
      You gave me your feet—
      that is a wonderful thing you did for me.
      O shining light!
      I embrace your arms and give my you life in return.
      I am alone and you are my dear father.

3573. Saḍagopan of rich Thirukuruhur
      composed a thousand beautiful pāsurams
      on our father, the god of Nānmuhan, of Shiva,
      of the sages and of the gods in the sky.
      He is the only god for this world.
      O devotees, learn and recite the ten pāsurams
      on the god and you will be saved.

3574. She says, “O my friends with round bangles,
      I am afraid of talking about my love for him to strangers.
      I am searching for him but haven’t found him.
      I want to tell you something.
      My conch bangles are loose, my body is pale
      and my round breasts have lost their golden color.
      The lord of Thiruvenkaṭam rides on a sharp-eyed eagle
      and I am searching for him.”

3575. She says, “O my friends,
      I can’t describe my sorrow even to my dear friends.
      I haven’t seen him and I am suffering.
      The handsome lotus-eyed Kaṇṇan,
      the lord of the gods in the sky is a thief.
      If I see him he will make my bangles loose
      and take away the lovely color of my body.
      How long can I suffer like this?”

3576. She says,
      “O my friends with lovely foreheads!
      Though time is passing,
      I haven’t grown tired of my love for him.
      See, the whole world blames me.
      What is the use of my being shy now?
      He has the color of a dark cloud,
      is beautiful like a blue flower
      and is surrounded by shining light.
      He took away my lovely bangles
      and the dark color of my body.
      How long I will suffer like this to see him?”

3577. She says,
      “I lost my round bangles and my heart to him
      and I am ashamed before my friends every day.
      The god Maayan who danced on a pot
      is the god of flourishing southern Kuḍandai
      surrounded by walls and porches where flags fly.
      Mighty, he conquers in war, carrying a discus and the Garuḍa flag.
      I love him and want to go to his place.”

3578. She says,
      “O friends if we wish, we can love the god with a discus
      and ask him to come here—
      it is easy to say this but hard to make it happen.
      He is the only god of all the eons.
      Even those who understand everything
      cannot understand him, the ancient shining god
      who plays sweet music on his flute.”

3579. She says,
      “There are no words to describe
      the beauty and luster of the ancient god.
      Even the gods cannot understand his might—
      they grow confused when they think of his greatness.
      He has taken away my dark color
      and does not give me his fresh garland of thulasi and waterlilies.
      Tell me, who can I tell about his naughty play?
      He, the Maal, has lovely lotus eyes
      and rests on the ocean in Kuḍandai
      surrounded by flourishing fields and valli creepers.”


3580. She says,
      “He makes me prattle on and say,
      ‘You are Maal, Hari, Kesavan, Naaraṇan, Shri,
      Madhavan, Govindan, Vaikundan.’
      He makes me crazy and doesn’t show me his form or even his footprints.
      O mothers, friends with hair decorated with fragrant flowers,
      I promise I will see him even if it takes many ages.
      I am not going to be friendly with you all
      because you don’t want me to wait to see him.”

3581. She says, “O parrots, I raised you!
      Puvai birds! Cuckoo bird! Peacocks!
      He took away my dark color, my conch bangles,
      and my heart, without leaving me anything.
      Vaikuṇṭam, the milky ocean, and dark Venkaṭa hill are all near,
      but we won’t be able to go to those places
      where he stays and see him until all our desires have left us.”

3582. She says,
      “O friends with beautiful foreheads,
      he doesn’t show his form even to his wise devotees.
      Using his magic, he became a dwarf,
      went to Mahābali, received a boon from him
      and measured the flourishing earth and the sky with his feet.
      He, the god of the gods, shines with his many arms.
      I have lost my modesty to him.
      What else have I to lose?”

3583. Her daughter says,
      “O friends, mothers, I will go there and stay—
      don’t try to convince me to stay here.
      Why do you want to stop me?
      My heart and my chastity don’t want to stay here.
      He, the dark ocean-colored lord Kaṇṇan
      who swallowed the world surrounded by the dark ocean
      stays in wonderful southern Thiruppereyil
      filled with flourishing paddy fields plowed by farmers.”

3584. Her daughter says,
      “ O friends, I will go to all towns and lands to find him,
      I am not ashamed at all.
      The god Makaraneḍumguzhaikkādar,
      the god on the earth for many eons,
      the Māyan who destroyed the Kauravas,
      the enemies of the Pāndavas,
      who has the color of a cloud and carries a matchless discus
      has taken my heart.”

3485. Sadagopan of beautiful Thirukkuruhur
      composed a thousand anthadi pāsurams on Achudan,
      the ocean-colored god
      who protects the earth and has many names,
      forms and deeds in every eon.
      If devotees learn these ten poems
      that praise the god of Thiruppereyil
      who holds a discus in his hand
      they will become his slaves.

3486. When he took the form of Thirivikraman
      and measured the world,
      his discus, his conch, his bow, his club and sword
      all appeared and everyone praised him everywhere.
      Our father’s head touched the sky
      and his feet touched the earth.
      This is the way the world and the eons appeared. CHECK

3487. At the time when our father
      churned the milky ocean to take the nectar,
      the sound of many rivers that are born in the mountains
      and fall down to the earth
      and the sound of the churning of the ocean with Mandara mountain
      and the loud sound of the snake Vasuki all spread everywhere.

3488. At the time our father
      took the form of a boar and split open the earth,
      the seven worlds stayed where they were without moving,
      the seven mountains stayed without shaking
      and the seven oceans did not rise and were still.

3489. When the world was ending
      our father swallowed the seven worlds,
      the oceans, the lands, the sky, the stars,
      fire, mountains, wind, moon and sun,
      protected them in his stomach,
      and when he spit them out
      everything in the world appeared again.

3490. When our father fought in the Bharatha war,
      the sound of the strong warriors being killed,
      the sound of the trembling of the army,
      and the sound of all the gods
      as they came to see what was happening
      spread all over the world.

3491. When our father took the form of a man-lion,
      and fought with Hiraṇyan and killed him
      the red blood that came from the Asuran’s body
      looked like the red sky when the sun sets
      and the lord looked like a lion that came out of a mountain
      that had split apart.

3492. When our father fought in Lanka
      and killed the Raksasas,
      the arrows were piled up everywhere
      and a flood of blood flowed like a river or an ocean.
      The bodies of the hundreds of elephants that were killed
      piled up like a mountain.

3493. When Vānasuran who came to fight with the god
      lost the war and our father cut off his thousand strong arms,
      Murugan carrying a rooster flag,
      Agni, the god of fire
      and Shiva with an eye on his forehead
      who had come to help the Asuran
      and were all defeated in the battle.

3494. Our father created the earth,
      oceans, fire, wind, sky, mountains,
      sun, moon, rain, all creatures and things in the world
      and the gods in the sky.
      Everything in the world is only his creation.

3495. When there was a storm and the rain pounded down and the wind blew
      and the water in the springs increased and overflowed
      and the cattle that were grazing were terrified,
      our father carried Govardana mountain as an umbrella
      and protected the cows
      and they all hid under the mountain and were saved.

3496. Sadagopan, the devotee of our god,
      composed a thousand good pāsurams on our father,
      describing how the lord carried Govardhana mountain
      to protect the cows and cowherds.
      If devotees learn and recite these ten pāsurams
      they will be successful in all their endeavors.

3497. In this world that was created by Nānmuhan
      Rama gave his grace to everything,
      from the ants to the grass,
      and all the creatures and things in Ayodhya,
      that move and do not move.
      If the devotees want to learn the stories of the gods,
      will they learn any other story about them except Rama’s?

3498. At the time when the Rakshasas
      afflicted the people of many lands,
      our lord was born on the earth, suffered for humankind,
      searched for the Rakshasas, destroyed them
      and saved the people and gave them back their lands.
      Could anyone become the devotee of any other god
      after hearing of his heroic deeds?

3499. Kaṇṇan destroyed Sisupalan
      but gave his grace to that Asuran
      even though he had said many evil things about the lord
      that hurt the ears of listeners.
      When his devotees hear the compassion of the lord
      they will praise only him.
      If the people hear the story of Sisupalan
      and how he reached the feet of the lord through the god’s compassion,
      they will not want to hear the fame of any gods other than our Kesavan.

3500. In ancient times before the eon when there was nothing,
      the god created the good waters and Nānmuhan,
      the creator of the creatures of the world.
      Wise men do not become the devotees of any gods but Kaṇṇan
      if they have learned how he created
      the ancient world when the eon began.

3501. At the time of pralaya
      when the earth was submerged under the deep ocean,
      our god did not hesitate to take the form of a boar
      and bring the earth up from the underworld on one tusk.
      If anyone knows and understands this story of the boar,
      will he worship any god but the feet of the ankleted Māyan?

3502. Mahābali received abundant power
      because he was so generous to all,
      and he grew arrogant and afflicted the gods.
      When the gods went to the lord and asked for help
      the lord took the form of a dwarf and went to Mahābali,
      begged him for three feet of land,
      and measured the earth and the sky with his two feet,
      freeing the gods from the suffering Mahābali had given them.
      If devotees hear and understand his play,
      how he extended his hands
      and begged for land from king Mahābali,
      they will not become the devotees of any god but Kesavan.

3503. When Shiva with matted hair promised Markandeyan
      who wore flower garlands swarming with bees
      that he would save him from Yama,
      he saved him as he had promised and took him to our god,
      and Kaṇṇan gave Markandeyan everlasting moksha.
      If devotees know and learn this story of Markandeya
      they will not become the devotees of any god except Kaṇṇan.

3504. When Hiraṇyan performed limitless tapas and received many boons
      and caused much distress to the gods with his power,
      our lord came as a strong man-lion to the earth
      and tore open the chest of the Raksasa Hiraṇyan.
      If devotees know the magical power of our lord,
      they will not wish to learn anything except the excellence
      of our precious Kaṇṇan.

3505. The whole country knows that when the hundred Kauravas
      took everything the Paṇḍavas had by gambling and cheating them,
      Kaṇṇan went as a charioteer for Arjuna
      and destroyed the Karuravas’ army on the battlefield.
      If devotees know what happened in the Bharatha war,
      will they become the devotee of any god
      other than Māyavan, the god with magical power?

3506. He removes the troubles
      of birth, sickness, old age and death for his devotees
      and makes them join his feet and protects them.
      If devotees understand his compassion
      will they become the slave of any other god than Māyavan?

3507. Sadagopan of southern Thirukkuruhur
      composed a thousand pure pāsurams on Kaṇṇan.
      If devotees believe that Kaṇṇan will surely give them moksha,
      he will give them the land of everlasting happiness,
      and if they learn and recite these ten pāsurams
      they will become devotees with faultless minds
      in all the three worlds.

3508. Are you Padmanābhan?
      Did you create the three worlds?
      Did you measure the world and the sky
      with your lotus feet as a dwarf ?
      Are you the lotus-eyed Kaṇṇan?
      Are your hands as beautiful as lotuses?
      I am alone. When will I come and join you?

3509. You, our father, contain in your body
      the earth, water, fire, wind and sky
      that you have created and you are all of them.
      You are a dancer and you grazed the cows
      and protected them from the storm
      by carrying Govardhana mountain as an umbrella.
      Alas! When will I reach your divine feet
      that are praised by Shiva and Nānmuhan?

3510. You, the dancer with a cool thulasi garland and flowers in your hair
      who carried Govardhana mountain to protect the cows from the storm
      and who are Shiva wearing kondrai flowers in his matted hair
      and Nānmuhan the creator of the world came to me and became my dear life.
      When can I join you whose unlimited fame is praised by all.

3511. Where will I get to see you,
      the cowherd adorned with a cool blooming thulasi garland
      dripping with honey?
      You are the beautiful three worlds,
      the three-eyed highest Shiva and Nānmuhan,
      Indra with the heroic shining vajrayudam in his hand
      and the other gods in the sky.

3512. You are my mischievous cowherd, my dark diamond,
      the three worlds that were created by Nānmugan
      who stays on the lotus on your navel,
      a flood of light and my dear life.
      How can I find you in my heart and join you?

3513. I do not know how to reach the bright sapphire-colored lord
      who, with his shining feet, navel, hands, chest, eyes and mouth
      is as beautiful as a ruby
      as he stays looking like a dark diamond with Lakshmi
      who sits on a blooming lotus on his divine chest
      wearing a red silk garment.

3514. On his navel is Nānmuhan, the beloved of the goddess of education
      and he is the lord of Indra who is the beloved of Indrani.
      Won’t I see him, the ruler of the sky
      who split open the earth to bring back the earth goddess
      and burned the three forts
      and who keeps beautiful Lakshmi on his divine chest
      while his body contains Shiva who shares half of it
      with Girija the daughter of the Himalayas?

3515. When he came to attack Lanka
      the Raksasas ran and hid in caves,
      looking like horses terrified at seeing a Yāli
      or like foxes that, seeing a lion, run screaming and hide.
      He flew on Garuda, fought and killed Māli
      and the other Raksasas so their bodies were piled up like hills.
      When will I see my lord?

3516. O heart, when can I see Rāma, the lion among the gods
      who destroyed the heroic lion-like Raksasa clan whose deeds were cruel
      and gave the kingdom of Lanka surrounded by the oceans
      to Rāvana’s brother Vibhishana before going back to Ayodhya,
      ruling the kingdom many years
      and finally going to the illustrious heaven in the sky?

3517. The mighty Kaṇṇan who is the highest divine light
      will give us moksha in Vaikuṇḍam, hard to reach.
      Raised as young child in a family of cowherds
      where he did many magical deeds,
      he killed Kamsan, as cruel as Yama,
      and fought with the terrible Kaurava army to help the five Pāndavas

3518. Saḍagopan composed a thousand pāsurams
      on the god with a discus who took the form of a lion
      and split open the body of the Asuran Hiraṇyan.
      If devotees learn these ten pāsurams and recite them
      they will be in heaven where beautiful women fan them
      and sing “Pallāṇḍu!”

3519. Her daughter says,
      “Are his two eyes Yamas
      that have come to take away the life of me,
      a poor women? I don’t know.
      Or are they the divine eyes of the lord Kaṇṇan
      who carries a shining discus? I don’t know.
      See, two things come and appear
      like fresh blooming lotuses before me.
      O my friends, mothers,
      what will I do? I suffer.”

3520. Her daughter says,
      “O mothers, what is the use of blaming me and scolding me?
      You just make me worry more.
      The divine nose of Kaṇṇan who ate so much butter
      entered my soul and shines like a bright light,
      but I’m not sure whether it is really his nose
      or a tall Karpaga creeper or a tender shoot.”

3521. Her daughter says,
      “Are his lips as red as a kovvai fruit?
      Are they lovely round coral stones?
      Have I done too much bad karma? I don’t know.
      The mouth sweet as a thondai fruit
      of the blue cloud-colored god
      appears everywhere in front of me
      and threatens my dear life.”

3522. Her daughter says,
      “Are the eyebrows of the lord two blue bent bows
      that take away the precious lives of lovely girls?
      Or are they the sugarcane bows
      of famous, everlasting Kama, the god of love?
      The eyebrows of the lord, the dear father of Kama,
      come to me and burn my precious heart and body.”

3523. Her daughter says,
      “Is the smile of the lord shining white lightning in the red sky?
      Are his teeth beautiful pearls that take away my life?
      I do not know.
      The smile of the lord who carried the Govardhana hills kills me.
      O mothers! I don’t know where I can go to survive.”

3524. Her daughter says,
      “See, the divine ears of the lord rests on a snake bed,
      adorned with beautiful earrings, ask,
      ‘What place is safe for the innocent girls who love the god,
      and what place is safe for the Asurans and the Raksasas
      from the god who is their enemy?’
      Those tender shoot-like ears burn me without stopping.”

3525. Her daughter says,
      “O mother, see,
      I don’t know any way to show you how I suffer from love.
      Is the white moon that rises every day
      poison for those who love someone?
      The divine forehead of the lord
      who has four beautiful strong arms
      takes away my life.
      Surely I have done bad karma.”

3526. Her daughter says,
      “Is the round circle of his faultless shining face
      a fresh-petaled lotus with a vine inside it,
      along with a coral, a bow, cool beautiful pearls,
      tender shoots and the cool crescent moon in the sky?
      It comes before me and kills me.
      I have done bad karma.”

3527. Her daughter says,
      “O mothers, is his hair a bundle of black threads,
      with luxurious curls parting the darkness with its stars?
      The beautiful sound of the flute of Maayan
      adorned with a fresh cool thulasi garland
      comes spreading fragrance and steals my dear life.
      You don’t understand my trouble,
      you just stand there and scold me.”

3528. Her daughter says,
      “He enters my yard holding his hands together,
      and circles around me.
      My heart has fallen in love with the bright crown
      of the dark shining diamond-colored lord
      that spreads its light in all the three worlds.
      O mothers, what do you want me to do?”

3529. Saḍagopan of Thirukkuruhur
      composed a thousand poems
      on the dark-colored Kaṇṇan
      whom even Nānmuhan, Shiva and Indra cannot see.
      If devotees learn and recite these ten pāsurams
      they will go to the sky and stay with the everlasting gods
      and will never die.

3530. You are Māyan, Vāmanan and Madhusudhanan,
      and even though you are fire, water, land, sky and the wind,
      our mother, father, our children and all other things in the world,
      you are yourself different than all of them.
      Look—is this fair? What kind of justice is this?
      Give us your grace.

3531. O lord Achuda adorned with a cool blooming thulasi garland,
      is it not a wonder that you are the moon,
      the sun, the bright day, the night, pouring rain,
      fame and disgrace and the cruel strong Yama?
      Give us your grace.

3532. You are all the yugas
      and, carrying a divine discus,
      you drove the beautiful chariot in the Bharatha war.
      Even though you are everything that is in the world,
      and you make all things function and make all things have the same nature,
      you are clever and also make them different.
      What kind of similarities and differences are these?
      Give us your grace.

3533. O lord Kaṇṇan with eyes as beautiful as lotuses that drip honey
      who rest on a snake bed on the large watery ocean in a yogic trance,
      you are what is and what is not
      and things that move and things and that do not.
      What kind of tricks are these?
      Give me your grace.

3534.O Mayava, give me your grace
so I may leave all desires and be only your devotee.
You who wear fragrant flowers
and a fresh thulasi garland in your hair
cause me to be born in this world with a body and life
and keep me here with your māyam.
What are these tricks?

3435. You who took the form of a dwarf,
      confuse us by being weariness and wakefulness,
      fire and cold, wonders and victories, karma and its results.
      Why do you give us all this confusion?
      Give me the knowledge of knowing you.

3536. O Kaṇṇan with long shining hair,
      you are the source of the desires that make us sad,
      the body that we suffer with the passions that we have,
      and past, present, and future.
      Is this all your play? Give us your grace.

3537. O Kaṇṇan, our ruler, you play many games
      but what do you gain from them?
      No one knows who you are.
      You created all the three worlds and everything in them
      and you are both in them and outside them.
      What is this nature of yours?

3538. O my Kaṇṇan, what is your nature? Where are you?
      You are all parts of us, our hands and legs,
      taste, sight, feeling, sound and smell.
      If we want to know all the things that you are
      they are so tiny there is no limit to them.

3539. The ancient, excellent sastras describe your good nature—
      there is nothing better than they to describe
      who are form and formlessness,
      and wear a thulasi garland with alli flowers on your chest.
      O Achuda, if any sastras describe the nature of any other god
      the nature they describe is only yours.

3540. Saḍagopan of Thirukuruhur
      composed a thousand beautiful Tamil pāsurams
      on the lord whose nature no one knows.
      If devotees learn and recite beautifully
      these ten Tamil pāsurams on the nature of the lord
      they will be always his dear devotees.

3541. He took me as his devotee forever,
      and after he had made me his,
      he made me compose sweet Tamil pāsurams
      praising him, the ancient lord, the shining light.
      What can I say to worship him?

3542. What should I say?
      The Māyan, the first among the three gods and my sweet life
      made me compose poems with words that were really his words.
      He made me famous
      because all people think that I composed these poems,
      but all the words I say are his.

3543. Thinking I am a good poet, he entered my tongue
      and made me compose these sweet pāsurams for his faultless devotees.
      He himself composed them, praising himself through my poems.
      He is my father. How could I forget him?

3544. He himself composed faultless poems
      about himself through me.
      Though I have done many things too wicked to describe,
      he himself is me and I know he saved me
      giving me his grace and making me a good poet.
      How could I forget my father?

3545. The highest lord understood that I,
      a low one, have no ability to compose sweet poems.
      He joined me with himself, and composed wonderful poems
      that are praised by the whole world.

3546. The divine lord of Vaikuṇṭam does not compose
      sweet poems himself on himself.
      He came to me lovingly and made me compose poems about him,
      singing beautiful poems on himself through me.

3547. The lord of Vaikuṇṭam destroyed my bad karma and made me a good person.
      He made me compose sweet poems
      that describe him as the lord of Vaikuṇṭam and praise him.
      My mind will not be satisfied
      even if I praise him forever in sweet poems.

3548. I am not fit to compose poems on him
      who carries a discus in his beautiful hands, but he joined me with himself
      and gave me the ability to compose sweet poems about him.
      Even if someone puts together the world, sky and water
      and praises the lord, it is not sufficient for the fame of the lord.

3549. He accepted me as his devotee
      and gave me his grace to compose many sweet pāsurams on him
      and did not forget me.
      Even if I praise his past, present and future virtue
      and enjoy it, it is not enough to praise him truly.
      How can I repay him for his help?

3550. Even if I wanted to give him my life
      for the things he has done for me it would not be enough
      because he who composed sweet pāsurams on himself through me
      created me and my life is his.
      I do not have anything to give to my father in return
      in this world or in the sky
      for the things that he has done for me.

3551. Sadagopan of flourishing Thirukkuruhur
      who knows that there is no place
      where the lord does not exist
      and that he is omnipresent
      composed a thousand pāsurams on the lord.
      Wherever devotees stay, however they recite these ten poems,
      they will obtain the joy of reaching the god.

3552. When will the day come when I can go to Thiruvāṛanviḷai
      surrounded with beautiful groves and circle around the hill and worship him,
      where the lord stays happily with Lakshmi, seated on a beautiful lotus,
      ruling this world while both give happiness to all?

3553. The lord who, taking the form of a divine dwarf,
      measured the wide world and the sky with his two feet
      stays in Thiruvāṛanviḷai surrounded by tall walls
      and filled with palaces where shining flags fly and touch the sky.
      When will the time come that I can go there
      with fragrant water and sprinkle it
      and circle the hill and worship him folding my hands?

3554. Will I be able to worship him every day, going to Thiruvāṛanviḷai
      where Govindan, Madhusudhanan, the man-lion stays
      riding on Garudan, surrounded with tall groves
      where Vediyars recite the four famous Vedas
      and six Upanishads and perform sacrifices.

3555. Will I be able to go and worship his lotus feet every day
      just as I worship in my heart here the famous Kanṇapirān,
      the sapphire-colored god of all the three worlds,
      who was born in northern Madura and stays in Thiruvāṛanviḷai
      surrounded by sugarcane and good paddy lands?

3556. My father who rests on a snake bed
      and gives his grace to many devotees,
      stays in Thiruvāṛanviḷai surrounded by tall walls
      and high palaces studded with jewels and flowers.
      If I keep his lotus-like feet in my heart always,
      worship him and sing his fame that spreads in all the worlds,
      all my karma will be destroyed and go away.

3557. I worship the lord who fought with Sisupalan,
      and brought Rukmani, embracing her lovely round arms,
      the god of beautiful Thiruvāṛanvilai who is in my heart all days and all times.
      O devotees, if you praise his fame, so abundantly praised by the world,
      all your bad karma will go away.

3558. When Neḍumāl, Kaṇṇan, the king of the gods in the sky,
      went to the kingdom of Vāṇan, fought a cruel war with the Asuran
      and cut off his thousand arms,
      three-eyed Shiva and his son Kārthikeya came to help Vānan
      but they retreated and ran from the battlefield.
      There is no other refuge than the feet of the god
      of flourishing Thiruvāṛanviḷai
      surrounded by groves blooming with flowers.

3559. When the elephant Gajendra stood on the bank of the pond,
      worshiped his divine ankleted feet and called him saying,
      “There is no refuge for me but you,”
      the lord went there, saved him from the crocodile
      and removed his affliction.
      He stays majestically in Thiruvāṛanviḷai
      surrounded by flourishing groves.
      If you go there and circle the hill
      the bad karma that troubles your mind will go away.

3560. Even if my bad karma is removed
      and I am able to go to heaven
      I will only want to go to Thiruvaṛanviḷai surrounded with groves
      where all the devotees come and worship him
      with their tongues, hearts and all their actions.
      My heart suffers not knowing when I will be able to go,
      circle the hill there and worship him.

3561. The god of the gods knows that a person’s heart
      does not leave the thoughts it has,
      and there is nothing magical that one cannot achieve
      if he always thinks of that one thing.
      There is nothing that I cannot achieve
      after I give myself to the god of Thiruvāṛanviḷai
      where the gods come to the earth and praise him
      with their minds and deeds.

3562. Saḍagopan from the flourishing southern Thirukkuruhur,
      giving his mind to the Theerthan
      and thinking that there is no other refuge except his feet,
      composed a thousand pāsurams with a pure mind on him.
      Even the gods worship the devotees
      who learn and recite these ten poems
      and tell their dear wives about them.

3563. O lord, shining jewel, with lotus eyes that kill me
      and a coral mouth that shines, you are my life,
      and you are the sweet nectar that you, my father, churned
      and took from the milky ocean roaring with waves.
      The divine Lakshmi and other goddesses obey you and serve you
      and your form rules all the three worlds which depend on you.
      I am your slave and I have done bad karma.
      Give me your grace—I long to see you.

3564. I have done bad karma.
      My eyes fill with tears, I worry and say,
      “Come and give me your grace so that I can see you!”
      and I prattle on saying only your names.
      O Kaṇṇan, I am the slave of you
      who are the fruit of the Karpaga tree,
      nectar for those who worship you,
      the generous lord who took the form of a boar,
      split open the ground and brought up the earth goddess
      surrounded by oceans from the underworld.
      O Kakutstha, give me your grace—I long to see you.

3565. O, you bright little elephant cub for Yasodha
      and great joy for cowherd families,
      raised as the small child of generous Nandagopan
      and as dear to him as his life,
      you are a beloved mother for me your slave,
      an ocean of strength,
      and the strong man-lion who split with your claws
      the body of the Asuran Hiraṇyan when he came to fight with you.
      Come in another form for us
      and we, your devotees, and the gods will be happy.

3566. O you who are my dear life,
      nectar for the gods in the sky and poison for the Asurans,
      my father who fought with the Kauravas
      and conquered their murderous army,
      the gods love you and became your friends,
      and you took various forms to make them happy..
      They do their deeds only through your māya.

3567. You are my dear life,
      the great lord who created the world, broke it,
      swallowed it, spat it out and measured it.
      You, the magnificent lord, created the milky ocean
      and churned it, and you rest on it on a snake bed.
      You are the god of the gods
      and the excellent life of the whole world.
      Where can I come to see you?

3568. Where will I find you, my ruler?
      You are formless, you are truth and sincerity,
      all the seven worlds, all the things
      that the gods or anyone want you to be,
      and all the actions that people do.
      If there is anything beyond all these things, that is also you.
      You are everything in the sky and above the sky.

3569. You are ghee made of fresh milk and its taste,
      the nectar that comes from the ocean and its sweet taste,
      the generous god who married Nappinnai and embraced her arms.
      You are past, present and future.
      I do not know whether your excellent nature
      is this, that, or in between. I have done bad karma.

3570. O cowherd who married Nappinnai,
      I have done bad karma
      but you attracted me with your excellent nature.
      You, the god of the milky ocean and a Yama for your enemies,
      fought with the strong-handed Asurans,
      raising your heroic eagle flag,
      and you rest on the thousand-headed snake Adishesha.
      I do not know how to worship you.
      My mind, words, deeds and I myself—all are you.

3571. I am indeed you. It is true
      that whatever there is in the world is yours,
      and if you yourself are evil hell
      then whether I reach the pleasures of heaven
      or go to hell, what difference does it make?
      Even though I know I am you,
      I am still afraid of going to hell.
      You stay forever in the heaven that gives joy.
      Give me the grace of reaching your feet.

3572. You have a thousand arms, a thousand heads,
      a thousand beautiful lotus eyes,
      a thousand feet and a thousand names.
      You gave me your feet—
      that is a wonderful thing you did for me.
      O shining light!
      I embrace your arms and give my you life in return.
      I am alone and you are my dear father.

3573. Saḍagopan of rich Thirukkuruhur
      composed a thousand beautiful pāsurams
      on our father, the god of Nānmuhan, of Shiva,
      of the sages and of the gods in the sky.
      He is the only god for this world.
      O devotees, learn and recite the ten pāsurams
      on the god and you will be saved.

3574. She says, “O my friends with round bangles,
      I am afraid of talking about my love for him to strangers.
      I am searching for him but haven’t found him.
      I want to tell you something.
      My conch bangles are loose, my body is pale
      and my round breasts have lost their golden color.
      The lord of Thiruvenkaṭam rides on a sharp-eyed eagle
      and I am searching for him.”

3575. She says, “O my friends,
      I can’t describe my sorrow even to my dear friends.
      I haven’t seen him and I am suffering.
      The handsome lotus-eyed Kaṇṇan,
      the lord of the gods in the sky is a thief.
      If I see him he will make my bangles loose
      and take away the lovely color of my body.
      How long can I suffer like this?”

3576. She says,
      “O my friends with lovely foreheads!
      Though time is passing,
      I haven’t grown tired of my love for him.
      See, the whole world blames me.
      What is the use of my being shy now?
      He has the color of a dark cloud,
      is beautiful like a blue flower
      and is surrounded by shining light.
      He took away my lovely bangles
      and the dark color of my body.
      How long I will suffer like this to see him?”

3577. She says,
      “I lost my round bangles and my heart to him
      and I am ashamed before my friends every day.
      The god Maayan who danced on a pot
      is the god of flourishing southern Kuḍandai
      surrounded by walls and porches where flags fly.
      Mighty, he conquers in war, carrying a discus and the Garuḍa flag.
      I love him and want to go to his place.”

3578. She says,
      “O friends if we wish, we can love the god with a discus
      and ask him to come here—
      it is easy to say this but hard to make it happen.
      He is the only god of all the eons.
      Even those who understand everything
      cannot understand him, the ancient shining god
      who plays sweet music on his flute.”

3579. She says,
      “There are no words to describe
      the beauty and luster of the ancient god.
      Even the gods cannot understand his might—
      they grow confused when they think of his greatness.
      He has taken away my dark color
      and does not give me his fresh garland of thulasi and waterlilies.
      Tell me, who can I tell about his naughty play?
      He, the Maal, has lovely lotus eyes
      and rests on the ocean in Kuḍandai
      surrounded by flourishing fields and valli creepers.”

3580. She says,
      “He makes me prattle on and say,
      ‘You are Maal, Hari, Kesavan, Naaraṇan, Shri,
      Madhavan, Govindan, Vaikundan.’
      He makes me crazy and doesn’t show me his form or even his footprints.
      O mothers, friends with hair decorated with fragrant flowers,
      I promise I will see him even if it takes many ages.
      I am not going to be friendly with you all
      because you don’t want me to wait to see him.”

3581. She says, “O parrots, I raised you!
      Puvai birds! Cuckoo bird! Peacocks!
      He took away my dark color, my conch bangles,
      and my heart, without leaving me anything.
      Vaikuṇṭam, the milky ocean, and dark Venkaṭa hill are all near,
      but we won’t be able to go to those places
      where he stays and see him until all our desires have left us.”

3582. She says,
      “O friends with beautiful foreheads,
      he doesn’t show his form even to his wise devotees.
      Using his magic, he became a dwarf,
      went to Mahābali, received a boon from him
      and measured the flourishing earth and the sky with his feet.
      He, the god of the gods, shines with his many arms.
      I have lost my modesty to him.
      What else have I to lose?”

3583. She says,
      “O my friends with lovely foreheads,
      what can I do? He carries a discus and a conch in his hands
      and comes like a tall beautiful dark hill
      over which a bright sun shines as a white milky moon rises.
      My heart said, ‘I don’t belong to you,’
      left me and went to the lotus feet of the god.”

3584. Saḍagopan of flourishing Thirukkuruhur
      who removed all other desires and gave his devotion
      only to the feet of famous Kaṇṇan
      composed a thousand pāsurams in faultless andādi metre
      praising the divine feet of Kaṇṇan.
      If devotees learn these ten pāsurams
      and recite them with music
      they will have no trouble in this world
      and reach the highest heaven.

3585. The gods in the sky and the Asurans
      have all joined together here, there and everywhere
      without knowing who you are,
      wandering and longing to see you
      but they cannot find you.
      They say, “He embraces the earth goddess, Lakshmi on a lotus,
      and Nappinnai the daughter of a cowherd.
      He carries a conch and a discus and is our refuge.”

3586. We will not depend
      on what we have learned in the Vedas and sastras
      that everyone believes and follows as if they were a refuge.
      We are rid of birth, terrible sicknesses,
      and old age because we have become the devotees of the lord
      who carries a fiery discus that destroys all his enemies and protects dharma.

3587. The king of the world who rules all
      carries a conch and a discus,
      and no one needs to follow him carrying a sword and a bow
      because he himself carries them.
      I want to worship his feet and arms but I have not seen him.
      I, his slave and day after day, search for him all over the earth,
      but I have not seen him.

3588. You, my father who rule the whole blissful world,
      slept on a banyan leaf at the end of the eon.
      For women who have vine-like waists
      and love your beautiful dark form,
      time seems like a darkness that spreads for an eon.

3589. You stay and rest happily always in Puliyanguḍi and Koḷur
      filled with palaces where beautiful vines grow.
      Are you resting because you have grown weary
      taking away the troubles of your devotees?
      Are you tired because you grew tall
      and measured the earth and the sky? Tell us.

3590. See, if the gods in the sky do not do what he says,
      the divine dark sapphire-colored lord
      who entered my heart and stays with me
      carrying a beautiful discus and a conch
      makes them be good and obey him.
      He cures the sicknesses of his devotees that can’t be cured.

3591. I see many of my friends come and go,
      but they do not go and tell my love
      to him who keeps the beautiful Lakshmi on his chest.
      What can I do?
      Tell him who carries a beautiful discus and a conch,
      “There is a devotee of yours who suffers with love for you
      and wants to join you.”

3592. O Thirumal who carry a discus
      and who stood and measured all the seven worlds
      surrounded by seven oceans and seven mountains
      with your ankleted feet,
      give me your grace and make me join your beautiful feet.

3593. If even Vishnu, Nānmuhan and Shiva with his red matted hair
      do not know the nature of our lord, who else could know his nature?
      What is the use of my talking about this?
      My love makes me suffer so I can only say,
      “He is the ancient god who rules me,
      the lord of the eon with a dark body.”

3594. The sages who do good tapas
      are never confused, scholars who learn the sastras well
      and the gods in the sky never tremble.
      They all worship our god
      who churned the vast ocean to get nectar from it.
      How can we, so fascinated with him, praise him?
      What can we do? Tell me.

3595. Saḍagopan of famous Thirukkuruhur
      surrounded with palaces as high as hills
      composed a thousand pāsurams with meter and good meanings
      praising the god adorned with a tall crown
      who removes the terrible sicknesses of people.
      If devotees learn well and recite these pāsurams
      they will not be born in this wide world.

3596. The elephant Kuvalayabeedam, large as a mountain,
      shed ichor like a waterfalls. He fought it, making it roll over,
      broke its tusks and killed its strong mahout.
      He, the lovely small child of cowherds,
      killed the wrestlers on a stage
      and Kamsan on the porch of a palace,
      and he fought with many kings and defeated them.
      He is our beloved god, our refuge
      and stays in Thiruchengundrur where the Thiruchitrāru flows

3597. He who is our father and the father of the gods,
      our sweet nectar, our refuge,
      created all the three worlds, protects them and destroys them.
      He has all these three forms and he is formless.
      I have no other companion except the ancient god
      of Thiruchengundrur that is on the banks of the Thiruchitrāru
      where lovely kayal fish frolic in the flourishing fields.

3598.The divine god of the gods in the sky
who took the form of a boar and split open the large world,
is my ruler who destroyed all my bad karma.
I cannot think of any refuge
except the two feet of my dear god of Thiruchengundrur
on the banks of the Thiruchitrāru that ornaments the southern land.

3599. My father, the beautiful jewel
      who churned the roaring milky ocean,
      took the form of a dwarf, grew tall,
      and measured the world and the sky with his feet
      at Mahābali’s sacrifice.
      I have no protection except the two feet of the dear god
      of Thiruchengundrur surrounded by trees
      with many ripening bananas, kamugu trees and sweet coconut trees
      where the Thiruchitraru flows.
      I don’t want even to think of anything except refuge
      at the feet of the dear lord in these three big worlds.

3600. There is no protection for me except him
      and there is nothing that I need if I have his protection.
      My refuge is the banks of the Thiruchitrāṛu river
      in Thiruchenkunṛur filled with tall palaces
      where Vediyars make sacrifices and recite the four Vedas
      and the smoke from them darkens the sky.

3601 He is my protection, my dear life,
the father and mother of the gods.
It is hard for anyone to know
and understand the wonderful nature
of our father who rests on the wide milky ocean.
I saw him in Thiruchitrāṛu in Thiruchenkundrur
filled with lovely palaces
where three thousand famous Vediyars, generous Shiva,
Nānmugan and devotees live.

3602. He has divine lotus eyes,
      a beautiful mouth, lovely hands,
      a navel where Nānmuhan stays on a lotus,
      beautiful garments, a precious crown,
      ornaments and heroic weapons.
      The famous god of Thiruchenkunṛur
      on the bank of Thiruchitrāṛu
      stays in my heart and shines.

3603. He who shines in my heart
      is the god of Thiruchengunḍur on the bank of Thiruchiṛṛāṛu
      where the farmers who own flourishing paddy lands
      and the Vediyars who recite the four Vedas
      worship the god in all directions, folding their hands.
      He fought with the heroic Asurans like a Yama,
      and he, the refuge of all the gods in the sky who worship him,
      created all the three worlds and protects them from destruction.
      I do not know how to praise him.

3604. He creates all the gods
      and the creatures of the world, keeping them from suffering.
      He himself, without beginning or end,
      is the highest god, and he is Nānmuhan and Shiva.
      No one else is fit to be praised—he receives all fame.
      He, with his beautiful nature, is the generous and famous god
      of Thiruchitrāṛu of Thiruchengundrur
      where the people are principled and clever and perform sacrifices.

3605. The lord our father is in all of creatures
      and he gives them his grace, the god of Thiruchengundrur
      on the banks of the Thiruchitraru flourishing with cool fields.
      Our god Māyon is the lord of Nānmuhan, the three-eyed Shiva,
      the three thousand Brahmins and the god of the gods.
      The whole world venerates him and I worship him with love.

3606. Saḍagopan of rich Thirukuruhur
      composed a thousand poems on the god of gods
      who is honey, sweet milk, sugarcane juice,
      and our father who swallowed the whole world.
      Our god the Māyon created the divine god Nānmuhan
      on a beautiful lotus on his navel.
      If devotees learn and recite these ten pāsurams
      they will attain moksha and receive the grace of the lord
      and their illusory births will go away.

3607. O Kaṇṇan, magical dancer and dwarf,
      your eyes, hands and legs are like pure red lotus flowers,
      your red shining mouth is like an opening lotus bud,
      your divine body is like a cool green leaf
      and you come as if you were a fragrant lotus pond.
      I have done much karma.
      Come to me one day—I long to see you.

3608. I call you saying, “Come, I want to see you!”
      and my eyes grow tired and my mouth dry.
      I am ashamed calling and calling you—
      I suffer to see you.
      Won’t you feel sorry for me and come?
      Come to me shining like a large dark diamond mountain
      behind which a dark sun rises at dawn,
      O father with a shining crown on your dark hair.

3609. O father with divine crown, if I long for you, cry and say,
      “You are adorned with a cool thulasi garland
      mixed with fragrant flowers that swarm with bees,”
      you will appear before me like a cloud filled with pure water,
      with four arms, a coral mouth, emerald earrings and a waist thin as a tuḍi drum.

3610. Your shining form that looks like a cloud filled with pure water,
      your mouth sweet as a fruit, your lotus eyes sweet as honey,
      all came and entered my thoughts.
      As you rest on the ocean abundant with pure water
      you are like a dark cloud in the flourishing rainy season
      floating above a silver mountain.
      O my father, I cannot describe your beauty.

3611. Your divine shining feet entered my mind
      like two morning suns of matchless beauty.
      I, your slave, cannot describe the loveliness
      of you who have the color of a cloud filled with good water
      and who swallowed all the flourishing world surrounded by oceans.
      Why do we suffer with troubles that come as darkness in our lives?
      Tell us why, or tell us how to remove the sufferings of life.

3612. I want you to rule me and I call and praise you saying,
      “You have the color of a cloud. You dance on a pot.
      I have done bad karma. O Kaṇṇan, my Kaṇṇan,
      you are the god of the sky.”
      Won’t you come to me from heaven
      or from the earth or from the ocean with its abundant water
      or from any other place? Appear in front of me one day
      so that I, your devotee, can see your ankleted feet.

3613. Come to me. If you don’t, I will come to your door
      and stay beneath your lotus feet that measured the world,
      and if I do that you will call me and make me serve you.
      You, my father, are like a dark sun
      with beautiful cool lotus eyes, a red mouth, hands and legs
      shining as it rises and spreads its endless rays.

3614. Every day whenever I see a mass of clouds
      my heart melts and I think,
      “This looks like the form of my father,” and I lose myself.
      You drove the good chariot for the five Pandavas
      and destroyed the hundred Kauravas,
      but you have not come to me. Is this right?

3615. If I say, “Is this right?
      You carry a shining discus and a Garuda flag
      and you ride on an eagle with huge wings,”
      and if I long for you and cry out what will you do?
      You are the Māyan and were born in northern Madhura
      surrounded by groves dripping with honey.
      You came to this earth to take away the suffering of its people.

3616. O Māyan, you were born on this earth to destroy the Asurans
      and you fought in the Bharatha war to help the Pandavas.
      You, the lord, are the wonderful wind, fire, water, sky, earth
      and all other things in the world.
      You are the Māyan who stays in everything
      but no one can see you because you hide
      like the ghee that is in fresh milk.
      Where can I see you?

3617. Saḍagopan of cool flourishing Thirukuruhur
      composed a thousand pāsurams
      with beautiful music and divine words
      in which a devotee asks the god,
      “Where can I see my father who wears a fresh thulasi garland?”
      If devotees learn and recite these ten pāsurams
      they will be happy night and day in this birth itself
      because they know the nature of god.

3618. He will give us his good grace
      so that we will think only of him
      when we get up every day in the morning and at night.
      My father whose hair is adorned
      with a beautiful thulasi garland strung with alli blossoms
      is the god of Thirukaḍithanam where good devotees live.

3619. See, the lord thinks that Thirukaḍithanam
      and my heart are the same and he enters my heart and stays there.
      He, the matchless one, fought, shooting arrows like rain
      at the astonished Rakshasa Ravaṇan and destroyed him
      so that even his shape could no longer be seen.

3620. The lord Māyan with beautiful Lakshmi on his chest
      has the forms of the three gods Shiva, Nānmuhan and Indra,
      yet formless, he has entered my heart who wishes to stay in Thirukaḍithanam.
      Whenever I think of him he is sweet.

3621. The lord Māyan who destroyed all my bad karma
      and abides in my heart with love as if that were his native place
      stays in the temple of Thirukaḍithanam surrounded by fragrant groves
      where all the gods in the sky come and worship him.

3622. He, the god in the temple of Thirukaḍithanam,
      has made my heart his temple and stays there.
      All the gods from many temples
      come to Thirukadithanam to worship him, our father who dances on a pot.

3623. I have done bad karma,
      but he, Madhusudhanan who dances on a pot,
      the god of flourishing Thirukaḍithanam surrounded by blooming groves,
      is my father and has destroyed all the troubles that afflict me.
      If you go there and praise him all your worries will go away.
      Keep this in your mind.

3624. The god Govindan who stays in my heart
      measured the whole earth and sky.
      All the people of the earth worship his beautiful lotus feet.
      Go to Thirukaḍithanam where the gods in the sky worship him
      and all your troubles will go away.

3625. Our Māyan stays in the sky,
      the earth, the ocean and many other good places
      and they all belong to him, but he chose my heart
      and Thirukaḍithanam for his temples .

3626. There are many marvelous places
      that belong to Māyan where he stays happily forever,
      but that wonderful god, the lord of cowherds,
      chose Thirukadithanam as his temple
      and stays there where the shining gods come and worship him.

3627. The wonderful god Narayaṇan, Hari, Vamaṇan
      stays in my heart and in Thirukaḍithanam
      surrounded by karpaga groves
      where good and renowned Vediyars loudly recite the Vedas.

3628. Saḍagopan of Thirukuruhur surrounded by walls
      composed a thousand pāsurams
      that are as sweet as nectar and milk mixed together
      praising Thirumāl of Thirukaḍithanam encircled by groves.
      If devotees learn these ten pāsurams and recite them
      they will go to Vaikuṇṭam and be happy.

3629. I worshiped the lord every day and said with amazement,
      “Come and keep me under your golden feet!”
      and the generous god Vamanan saw me
      entered my heart and stayed there.
      He is happy to be with me.

3630. He has entered my poor heart
      and destroyed the feelings of the five senses that rule it,
      not allowing me to fall into the desires they cause.
      The grace that my dear lord has given me
      is higher than the grace that he gave to Gajendra—
      I do not know how that happened.

3631. I cannot understand how he has such love for me
      that he gives me his wonderful grace,
      staying in my heart and removing all my ignorance.
      He does not think ruling all the three worlds
      is more important than staying in my heart.
      What kind of confusion is this?
      Or is it just that I am confused to be in an illusory world?

3632. He is my father, the lord of cowherds and the gods in the sky,
      and the man-lion. He, a faultless shining light,
      confused me with his power of illusion.
      He gave his divine grace that is praised in all lands,
      came to me and stayed within me.

3633. He who abides like a shining diamond hill
      gave his divine grace to me,
      endowing me with fame that makes the world praise me,
      yet all the fame I have is not important for me, only his grace.

3634. There are so many things that the lord can give me,
      but he gave me himself.
      How could he give himself to anyone else
      after he has given me himself?
      His body that is like a dark diamond hill
      has a divine chest, legs, eyes, hands and beautiful mouth and belly
      that are all as lovely as blooming lotuses

3635. His lovely mouth, ears ornamented with shining earrings,
      and his white teeth all shine, each competing with the other.
      He stays in my heart smiling with his red mouth.
      I know no grace except the grace of the smile of his mouth.

3636. The lord rules me and if he wants to give his grace to someone,
      he gives it without expecting anything in return.
      I am a small devotee. He who swallowed all the three worlds
      and keeps them in his stomach has entered my heart and stays there.

3637. The three worlds protected by kings
      were all destroyed at the end of the eon, swallowed by lord Maal
      who kept them in his stomach and protected them.
      With my cleverness, I made him come to me and keep him in my heart.

3638. He is the highest lord resting on the shining thousand-headed Adishesha
      on the cool milky ocean always filled with rolling waves.
      With my cleverness I made him enter my heart.
      I will never grow tired of him or let him leave me.

3639. Saḍagopan of flourishing Thirukuruhur
      composed a thousand pāsurams praising Thirumal,
      our highest god who rests on shining Adishesha.
      If devotees learn and recite these ten pāsurams,
      the god’s eyes will become red
      as he grows angry at their karma
      and he will remove their births.

3640. He has beautiful large eyes,
      a soft red mouth and white shining teeth
      and his ears are adorned with shining makara earrings.
      The dark cloud-colored sole lord wearing a shining crown
      stays in the mind of me his slave with his four arms
      that hold a bent bow, conch, club, sword and discus.

3641. I am his devotee and he is in my soul and body,
      in all fragrances, in the sky, and inside and outside of everyone—
      nothing can be compared with the highest lord.
      He, the lord of the sky and joy for his devotees,
      takes away sorrow and gives happiness to all.
      He has undiminished fame and he is in the feelings of all.

3642. No one can understand the highest god—
      I understand him and keep him in my heart
      only through his sweet grace.
      I know that my feelings, life, body
      and all other things are not true,
      for he gives me all my knowledge
      and has entered my heart and become one with me.

3643. He, the ancient lord of all things and all people,
      Shiva and Nānmuhan, the unique one,
      the cause that branched out to become everything,
      makes me and himself one.
      He is sweetness—honey, milk, sugar juice and nectar.
      I know him who is in my body, my life and my awareness.

3644. I understand that he is the one thing that abides in all
      yet no one can understand his excellence, whether it is this or that,
      and even if someone understands it, he cannot really see it.
      It becomes smaller and smaller and, as the highest of the high,
      it is without being anything.
      No one has the knowledge to know whether it is good or bad,
      yet it is a good thing and abides even beyond knowing.

3645. It is a good thing and abides even beyond knowing.
      One should understand that it is unique, beyond all the senses
      and know that it is rare, a wonderful thing not of the world.
      If someone destroys happiness and sorrow and removes all desires
      that very day and that very time he reaches moksha.
      Being in that state is truly moksha, liberation.

3646. If someone has no desire and owns nothing,
      that is moksha and having attained it there is joy.
      If someone does not know this and worries,
      “What is moksha? What is happiness?”
      he will be confused and worried always.
      One should understand that true moksha
      is to remove all desires of the world
      and that is true happiness.

3647. When you die, your family and relatives
      will worry and worry and crowd around you.
      Before you lose your awareness,
      if, as if you had become crazy, you think of god
      and a feeling of joy comes to your mind
      and your heart joins the dear lord
      that is the good way to obtain moksha.

3648. Is it possible that the soul and the highest god
      who carries an eagle flag can become one? They are not the same.
      If they could become one then there is no god or soul.
      Māyan will be himself, and the soul will be itself.
      There are always yogis who run and wander around
      in the past, future and present saying that they will reach moksha,
      but their moksha is imaginary.
      Reaching god by devotion is the only moksha.

3649. God is always there for his devotees.
      He is even there for those who say there is no god.

He comes to me, enters my heart and stays there.
Wisdom and ignorance come and go
like the waxing and waning moon.
We should get rid of clarity and confusion
that come and go like the shining day and the night.

3650. Saḍagopan composed a thousand pāsurams
      on Thirumal, the father of Shiva and Nānmuhan.
      He removes the confusion and the ignorance of all
      and keeps his devotees beneath his feet
      that are ornamented with pure golden anklets.
      If devotees learn and recite these ten pāsurams
      they will go and stay beneath the feet
      of our dark diamond-colored lord and receive his grace.

3651. Her friend says,
      “O mothers, how can I help my friend?
      Your daughter doesn’t say anything
      except the name of the great Māyan
      whose divine chest, mouth, eyes, hands, legs and belly
      all look like lotuses blooming in a forest on a dark diamond hill.
      Our beautiful lord Thirumal, adorned with ornaments and garments,
      stays in Thirupuliyur in Kuṭṭanaḍu
      that flourishes with fields and good water.”

3652. Her friend says,
      “O mothers, how can I help my friend?
      Our lord wears a tall shining crown, a necklace and many ornaments
      and he looks like the sun shining with many bright rays
      as it circles Meru mountain.
      All she does is praise our dear god of Thirupuliyur
      surrounded with beautiful punnai groves.”

3653. Her friend says,
      “She praises the dark ocean-colored god night and day.
      Carrying a shining discus and other weapons
      he entered into war like the shining fire
      that burns in the roaring ocean,
      fought with the Asurans and destroyed them.
      He stays in flourishing Thiruppuliyur
      filled with tall shining palaces studded with precious jewels.”

3654. Her friend says,
      “O mother, your daughter adorned with lovely ornaments
      doesn’t praise anything except the fame
      of our dear god who swallowed all the famous three worlds,
      the lord of Thirupppuliyur in Kuṭṭanadu
      filled with cool fields that farmers plow
      where abundant paddy and sugarcane grow
      flourishing with good groves that increase its prosperity.”

3655. Her friend says,
      “O mother, if you consider the precious ornaments she wears now,
      her clothes and the smart way she thinks
      you will understand that she is plunged into the divine grace
      of the father, the lord, the ruler of all three worlds,
      the god of prosperous Thirupuliyur
      where large lotuses bloom in mountain springs.”

3656. Her friend says,
      “O mother, the red lips of the gentle girl
      are like ripe kamuku fruits that flourish
      through the divine grace of the god of prosperous Thirupuliyur.
      They are a sign that every day she plunges
      into the love of the dark ocean-colored god Kaṇṇan
      and that she has the grace of the lord.”

3657. Her friend says,
      “O mother, this lovely girl reaches the feet
      of our precious Kaṇṇan, the warrior, the god of Thirupuliyur
      where the leaves of vines embrace the soft branches of the Kamugu trees
      and a lovely breeze spreads the fragrance of jasmine
      as it blows through the banana and coconut trees.”

3658. Her friend says,
      “What can I say to the mothers of this beautiful girl?
      He rests on Adishesa on the water in rich Thiruppuliyur
      where the Vediyars of flourishing Mallai
      perform sacrifices, reciting the Vedas of the northern language,
      and the smoke from the fire as they pour ghee
      rises and hides the country of the gods in the wide sky.
      She doesn’t say anything except to praise his names.”

3659. Her friend says,
      “Your daughter’s eyes are filled with tears
      and night and day she doesn’t say anything
      except to praise the fame of Thiruppuliyur
      surrounded with fields plowed by farmers
      where the lord Kaṇṇan stays
      and the sound of the Vedas that the Vediyars recite
      resounds like the sound of the ocean
      and the lotuses in the large ponds bloom like bright lamps.”

3660. Here friend says,
      “She has the grace of Māyappiran,
      the god of Thippuliyur that is like a thilagam for southern Kuṭṭanaḍu
      surrounded by beautiful mountain-like palaces
      with porches studded with precious jewels.
      The only way for her to be happy is for her to inhale
      the fragrance of the fresh thulasi garland of the lord.”

3661. Saḍagopan, the devotee of the devotees
      of the devotees of the devotees,
      became the slave of the lord of the marvelous three worlds
      and composed a garland of a thousand Tamil pāsurams.
      If devotees learn and recite these ten pāsurams
      they will have the fortune of becoming the slaves of Neḍumal.

3662. If someone dances and wants
      to become a slave of Neḍumāl without cheating him,
      and if he wants to remove his karma
      and join the feet of his devotees
      what achievement could be better than that?
      It is better to serve the devotees of the lord
      than to get the three wide worlds.

3663. Even if I were to get all the three wide worlds
      and became the unrivaled king of those worlds
      would it be equal to the joy
      of serving in this birth the devotees of god as his slave
      and worshiping their feet?
      They abide beneath his ankleted feet
      whose divine body is dark as a cloud.
      How could I get their good fortune in this birth?

3664. The lord with beautiful lotus eyes
      took the form of a small divine dwarf
      and measured all the three worlds.
      I don’t want even to stay
      beneath the fresh fragrant lotus feet of the lord
      if I, a sinner, could have the fortune
      of being the devotee of his devotees,
      ruled by them as they wander on this earth as ordinary people.

3665. What is wrong if I run behind the devotees
      of the lotus-eyed lord to get their grace
      as they carry flowers in their beautiful hands,
      sing his abundant praise with their mouths
      and keep his form in their minds as all their senses
      enjoy my father who has beautiful lotus eyes and a red coral mouth,
      the god who swallowed the large world and spat it out.

3666. Even if someone worships, receives the grace of Māyan,
      and, staying beneath his beautiful lotus feet,
      experiences bliss in a flood of glowing light
      as it flows like swirling, running water,
      can he get the nectar-like feeling of learning the beautiful pāsurams
      and singing them with the devotees of god so he feels as if he were flying
      even though his body is not pure enough to sing those pāsurams?

3667. The lord, carrying a discus and riding on Garuḍa,
      killed many red-haired Asurans with burning eyes
      and he also destroyed the elephant with a dotted face.
      Even the joy of hearing the fame of our dear lord
      and reaching moksha is not equal to the happiness
      someone can receive singing the pāsurams that praise the lord.

3668. I would like to stay beneath the feet,
      gentle as shoots, of the unique divine lord
      whose fame is excellent and everlasting
      and who created the sage Nānmuhan and the three worlds,
      but it is better to receive the joy of joining always
      the devotees who sing and praise the ancient god.

3669. Our lord created the cool ocean of abundant water
      and lies on it like a mountain of jewels
      with the stars for his matchless arms and legs
      that are like the branches of the divine Karpaga tree
      as he wears a crown that shines like many suns.
      I long for the bliss of joining his devotees.

3670. The lord dances on a pot
      and destroys the bad karma of his worshipers.
      He carries many weapons—
      a discus, conch, sword, bow and club
      and is the father of the ever-young Kama
      who carries five beautiful flower arrows.
      I long to be a faultless devotee of the devotees
      of the devotees of the devotees of the lord.

3671. My father with four arms and a dark body like a flower
      carries a golden discus in his hand and abides eon after eon.
      My only wish is to be the slave
      of the devotees of the devotees of the devotees of him.
      They are my lords, for they never leave our god.

3672. Saḍagopan of cool, lovely Thirukuruhur
      composed a thousand pāsurams on lotus-eyed Kaṇṇan,
      the god of all the three worlds that follow good beliefs.
      If devotees learn and recite these ten pāsurams
      they will live happily with their wives and children on the earth.

3673. The love that wives, children, relatives,
      neighbors and others show is not real,
      it only appears to be true love.
      The only thing that can help us
      is to become the devotee of the all-powerful god
      who swallowed the eight directions
      and everything above and below it.

3674. Friends, relatives, neighbors
      and others will cling to you like leeches if you have wealth.
      They will enjoy it and leave you if you become poor.
      There is no help for you unless you take refuge
      in the dark cloud-colored god
      who shot one arrow and destroyed the seven marā trees.
      He is like a boat in the storm of life.

3675. If you have wealth in your hands
      everyone will stay with you and say, “We praise you!”
      and enjoy your wealth,
      but if, as if you were entering darkness, you become poor,
      no one will come and even say, “What is this, you are poor!”
      There is no refuge for you unless you become the devotee
      of the lord born in northern Mathura
      who destroyed the terrible Asurans and their cruel deeds.

3676. People think their friends will help them
      when they are in need and keep them with them,
      but those they trust will be useless, like a boat with a hole in it.
      No matter what you have given them,
      when you need them they will not help you.
      What is the use of my saying this?
      There are no good times and no protection in life
      unless you find refuge praising the generous fame
      of the lord born in northern Mathura.

3677. Those who think that a happy life
      is to live with women whose words are sweet
      and to experience honey-like pleasure with them
      will be chased away by those women when they become poor.
      There is no way to survive unless you becomes a devotee of him
      who was born in northern Mathura,
      and fought and destroyed the cruel Asurans.

3678. There is no joy in this world.
      So many people have been born and died
      never learning the truth of life.
      The only refuge for you is to praise the generous fame
      of him who was born in ancient flourishing northern Mathura.
      This is my humble advice to you.

3679. I would like to say one thing briefly.
      Don’t worry. Think deeply about what you should do.
      There is no other way for any life on the earth.
      It is not wrong to live every day
      praising the faultless greatness of the lord
      born in northern Mathura, our father and creator.

3680. The best way is to live praising him.
      What a wonder!
      For those who are not wicked and pass their time
      praising the feet of Māyavan
      there is nothing better than praising the generous fame
      of the lord, born in northern Mathura
      and lovingly thinking of him as their refuge.

3681. If someone pursues useless things
      thinking nothing is better, he will lose his life—
      it is as if someone kept enlarging the holes in his ears
      until they are so big he cannot wear earrings.
      There is no refuge except Kaṇṇan
      whose feet are adorned with garlands dripping with pollen
      and who was born in northern Mathura
      filled with palaces where silk-like flags fly.

3682. There is no refuge except Kaṇṇan,
      born in northern Mathura,
      to take away the sufferings of the earth.
      If you have any wealth, lay it at his feet
      and, thinking he is your only refuge,
      join his feet and survive.
      Don’t think otherwise.
      Anything that belongs to you is his
      and there is nothing that does not belong to him.

3683. Saḍagopan of Thirukuruhur,
      thinking devotedly that there is nothing other than the god himself,
      composed a thousand beautiful faultless Tamil pāsurams
      on Kaṇṇan adorned with garlands that drip pollen.
      If devotees learn and recite these ten wonderful Tamil pāsurams
      they will be like our esteemed ancestors.

3684. You are the lord of Thiruppuḷinguḍi
      surrounded by flourishing fields
      near the ocean that rolls with clear waves.
      Devotees come to the temple generation after generation
      where you and Lakshmi on a lotus
      have given divine grace to all from ancient times.
      Open your divine mouth and give your grace,
      looking at your devotees with your lotus eyes.

3685. You have given your grace to the devotees
      who worship your golden feet and serve you as slaves
      for generation after generation with their families.
      Adorn my head by placing your lotus feet
      that measured the world upon it,
      O god of Thiruppuḷinguḍi
      surrounded by cool fields and golden walls where flags fly.

3686. How long can you rest on the ocean? Doesn’t it pain your body?
      Give your grace to us your slaves
      who serve you ceaselessly generation after generation.
      Open your large lotus eyes and get up
      with your wife Lakshmi on a lotus
      and, worshiped by all the three large worlds,
      give us your grace, O lord of Thiruppulinguḍi.

3687. In Thiruppuḷinguḍi you recline, resting on the ocean,
      in Varagunamangai you sit and in Vaikuṇṭam you stand.
      Rule me, never leave my flawless heart,
      O you with a shining cloud-colored body
      and a coral-red mouth as sweet as a fruit.
      Come and see us while we loudly sing your praise and dance
      as all the three worlds look on in awe and wonder.

3688. In flourishing Thiruppulinguḍi
      you rest on the ocean that yields conches and corals.
      As you give your grace to us
      with your divine compassionate lotus eyes
      your coral-like mouth that is as sweet as a fruit becomes red
      and you smile making your moon-like teeth shine,
      O god who rode on an eagle and saved Gajendran,
      the elephant that ate large balls of rice,
      when a crocodile in a pond caught him.

3689. Riding your angry eagle,
      you fought with the fearful Asurans Mali and Malimān,
      looking like a dark cloud on a golden hill.
      Adorned with a shining crown,
      you are the god of Thiruppulinguḍi surrounded by flourishing fields
      and you carry a discus, conch, sword, bow and club
      and angrily fight the Asurans in war, taking away the troubles of everyone.

3690. You, the god of gods, our ruler
      who take away our troubles and relieve the suffering of the gods,
      stay in flourishing Thiruppuḷinguḍi
      filled with fields where lotuses with red petals bloom.
      Come before us one day
      so that the people of the beautiful world can see you
      and feel joy in their hearts as they see your devotees praise you.

3691. You stay in Thiruppuḷinguḍi
      where the moon shines on the tops of the palaces.
      All in the world worship your feet,
      bow to you and praise you with loving words,
      worshiping you again and again.
      O god, who stay in divine Vaikuṇṭam,
      one day you should come to this wide world
      and stay here so that we can all see you.

3692. You who, cruel as Yama with his strong weapons,
      destroy the clan of Asurans, stay in Thiruppuḷinguḍi
      flourishing with fields where vālai fish frolic
      among the good paddy plants growing in the wet mud.
      You should come and stay majestically in this wide world
      so your devotees may see your divine body
      as their eyes rejoice and they praise you without ceasing.

3693. You, the god of Thiruppuḷinguḍi surrounded with flourishing fields,
      carrying strong weapons for fighting dreadful battles,
      took away the troubles of the gods in the sky and gave pain to the Asurans.
      You are poison for the Asurans but nectar for me.
      Matchless Lakshmi and the earth goddess massage your soft feet—
      call me one day or come here so I may massage your feet also.

3694. Saḍagopan of the Pandiyan land
      where pure water is abundant
      composed a thousand musical pāsurams
      praising the lord who churned the roaring milky ocean.
      If devotees learn and recite well these ten pāsurams
      in which the poet asks the god,
      “Call me to come to you or you come to me!”
      they will think in their hearts unceasingly
      of his two feet that measured the three worlds.

3695. He has a thousand names
      and he protects the seven worlds with them.
      With his divine body that is as dark as a cloud
      he is truly Narayanan, our dear lord.

3696. He created the wide world and split it open,
      swallowed the world and spat it out,
      and he measured the world.
      He is indeed Shiva, Nānmuhan and Indra,
      and he himself is each of them
      and all creatures and things in this world.
      We know this.

3697. The Vedas, the sastras, the purāṇas and epics
      all say they know that he is the true unattainable object.
      Wise men and sages worship the lord Hari
      and know him as the remedy for any sickness.
      He gave me the fortune of knowing him truly.

3698. The group of eminent gods prattle and praise him
      saying, “You take away the joy that our desires give
      and cure us of the troubles they cause.”
      He, the dark lord Kaṇṇan, is our father, and he rules the sky.
      O heart, do not let him go away from my mind.

3699. O heart, I who have done much bad karma
      beg you and tell you firmly, “Do not leave him!”
      Your aim should be to reach the god
      who wears a beautiful cool thulasi garland from the forest.
      who does not belong to anything.

3700. He embraces the beautiful arms of Lakshmi
      and he fights only with the Asurans in his cruel wars.
      My heart melts only for him
      who churned the milky ocean and took its nectar.

3701. Night and day my heart longs to see him
      who took the form of a man-lion
      and split open the chest of Hiraṇyan with his sharp claws,
      the god of the sky in Vaikuṇṭam.

3702. He destroys good and bad karma
      and saves us from future births
      so our bodies will not be born again.
      I will not leave this place—
      there is no difference between heaven and the Venkaṭam hills
      where the gods of the sky come to worship the lord.

3703. It seems it is not enough
      to worship you with beautiful flowers,
      water and shining lamps and fragrance
      because I have not seen you
      who are famous from ancient times
      and rest on a faultless snake bed.
      I do not know how to embrace your feet.

3704. Brahma stays on a lotus
      and its stalk grows from your navel,

Shiva carrying a shining mazhu weapon stays on your body,
and the gods in the sky come and worship you on this earth.
I cannot truly praise your divine nature
even if I praise you all my life.

3705. Saḍagopan of beautiful Thirukuruhur
      composed a garland of a thousand pāsurams on the lord
      whose goodness has no bounds.
      If devotees learn and recite these ten pāsurams
      they will surely reach Vaikuṇṭam.

3706. O Thirumāl, the beautiful goddess Lakshmi
      with eyes dark as kohl
      stays with you on a lotus on your divine chest
      and you carry in your hands
      a curved conch and a discus with shining rays.
      My eyes long to see you.

3707. You are my beloved.
      My heart has one desire and that is to see you
      and call you with love.
      Even the gods in the sky and the sages cannot see you,
      but I call you and think that I will not go away unless I join you.

3708. O you who carried Govardhana mountain
      and protected the cows from the storm,
      I am like a dog wagging his tail lovingly
      as I call you with my heart that melts for your love,
      worried that I may not receive your grace.

3709. O matchless father who took the form of a man-lion,
      the gods in the sky and the Asurans do not know who you are.
      My heart’s only thought is to be your slave,
      but my poor heart does not know
      how it will come to be in your presence.

3710. Our father, the god of the gods,
      created Shiva and Brahma in ancient times,
      took the form of a man-lion,
      and rests on the shining bed of a striped snake.
      My only desire is to see the ornamented feet of the dark lord.

3711. You are my thought.
      I want to see you and keep you in my heart firmly
      who are the highest god of the gods in the sky
      and a matchless bright light.
      My heart thinks happily only of you.

3712. O faultless one, my heart thinks happily of you
      who took the form of a man-lion
      and split the chest of the arrogant Asuran Hiraṇyan in two.
      You desired me, came to me and have stayed in my heart.

3713. He, ancient and formless,
      is the source of all the six religions,
      the inner soul of all things and creatures
      and the origin of all the gods in the sky.
      I have found Kaṇṇan.

3714. He is as precious to me as my eyes
      and I am filled with joy to have found him.
      All my old karma has been rooted out
      and I, a devotee of the highest god of the gods in the sky,
      have composed pasurams on the god
      that are like nectar for his devotees.

3715. Neḍumal who carries the banner of the famous lovely-winged Garuda
      and measured the whole earth covering it completely with his one foot
      gives his grace to me thinking, “He is my devotee.”
      I have received him and am saved.

3716. Saḍagopan of southern Thirukuruhur
      surrounded by flourishing fields of earth
      composed a thousand pāsurams on the god
      who conquered the rutting elephant Kuvalayabeedam.
      If devotees learn and recite these ten pāsurams
      they will reach the god, the dear life of the gods in the sky.


3717. She says, “O cuckoo birds!
      You and your sweet mates, as precious to you as life,
      cause me pain as you call each other.
      Do not prattle like this.
      Lord Kaṇṇan is as precious as my life
      and you are not calling him.
      If you are cooing to take my life and give it to him,
      do you need to coo like this?”

3718. She says, “O andril birds!
      Do you need to do these things?
      How long will you and your mate call, longing for each other?
      The clever Govindan is not truthful to anyone.
      Why do I say these things? My life is in his hands.”

3719. She says, “O dear andril birds!
      My dear life is in his hands.
      How can you join together, speak with each other,
      and plunge into the water with your beloved mates?
      How is it I am still alive
      after hearing you chatter to each other?”

3720. She says, “O male and female birds!
      Our Māyan Kaṇṇan will not come here
      even if he hears you calling him.
      Don’t keep doing this.
      My words, mind and deeds are all with him
      and my body and life are up in the sky, where they swirl.”

3721. She says, “O puvai birds
      moving all over the sky,
      you should not feel sorry for me.
      It isn’t your fault. Don’t prattle on.
      The lord with Lakshmi on his chest
      swallowed all the seven worlds
      and does many magical tricks.
      He is thinking of taking my life away.
      Does he think this is something good?”

3722. She says, “O little parrot,
      I raised you with love and affection and kept you happy.
      Don’t prattle on with your sweet voice.
      Kakusthan, my dear beloved god
      has a mouth as red as yours
      beautiful eyes, hands and legs
      and a green color like yours.
      He embraced me and left me.”

3723. She says,
      “O clouds shining with lightning and rainbows,
      with the color of Māyan,
      the god Kaṇṇan, the faultless dark diamond
      with lovely lotus eyes and a red mouth,
      do not come in front of me.
      You are like Yama to my life.”

3724. She says,
      “O soft baby cuckoo bird!
      I begged you to go and tell him that he is like Yama for me
      because I love him and may not live.
      You are always prattling the names of Kaṇṇan.
      I gave you yogurt mixed with old rice, fruits and sweet rice
      and taught you to speak.
      Is this how you repay me? Is this good?”

3725. She says,
      “O female bees with your fine mates,
      don’t buzz and fly around.
      Even though you sing sweetly
      your sweet voices hurt me
      as if someone were pricking a wound with a sharp spear.
      The god Kaṇṇan with large eyes like lotus flowers
      that bloom in a cool wide pool
      approached us only to take our life away.”

3726. She says,
      “O good nārai birds in the fields,
      because we love the lord of the sky,
      what is the use of thinking of anything else?
      I am not interested in wearing ornaments
      and talking about things I enjoy.
      Let this world flourish and people have their pleasure.”

3727. Saḍagopan of southern Kuruhur
      composed a thousand pāsurams on the god Māyan,
      the lord who gave his grace to make this world flourish
      and to make the people of the world
      live happily for many eons and praise him.
      If people in the three worlds learn and recite these ten pāsurams
      they will melt in devotion for the lord.

3728. When I think of the māya of you,
      the god Māyan of Thirukkāṭkarai
      where the fragrance of kāvi blossoms spreads
      over all the streets, my heart melts
      and cannot control its always increasing love.
      I am your servant, what should I do?

3729. You are my father
      who stay in southern Thirukāṭkarai
      surrounded by blooming groves and springs.
      Whenever I think or speak of you
      my heart suffers and goes to pieces,
      and whenever I sing of your heroic deeds
      my dear life burns. I do not know how to serve you.

3730. My father, the cloud-colored lord
      of southern Thirukāṭkarai
      surrounded by beautiful flourishing groves
      attracted me and entered my heart.
      He bewitched me, became my life and took me over.
      I do not understand his tricks.

3731. My father, the god of southern Thirukāṭkarai
      where groves spread their fragrance everywhere
      contains all the worlds in himself
      and abides in all of them with virtue.
      I cannot understand his divine grace
      that has taken over my tiny life.

3732. My father of southern Thirukāṭkarai
      where lovely groves grow
      entered my heart as if to give me his divine grace,
      at once taking over my body and my dear life.
      How can I describe the tricks of my dark-colored Kaṇṇan?

3733. I think the tricks of my beautiful Kaṇṇan are wonderful.
      He takes over my dear life
      and night and day I worry, prattling on
      and praising Thirukāṭkarai, saying, “He is my Kaṇṇan.”

3734. When I say, “O Kaṇṇan, you stay in Thirukāṭkarai,”
      my desire for him increases.
      I think of him always and melt
      for that Māyan who took me as his slave.
      There is only a little of my life left—
      I want to spend that time praising Thirukāṭkarai.

3735. Taking me as his slave,
      he took my life as his and comes to me every day.
      My dear life and my heart belong to my father,
      the lord of southern Thirukāṭkarai
      where beautiful dark clouds float in the sky.

3736. The divine ocean-like god has four large arms,
      a mouth sweet as a fruit, eyes like lotuses with large petals
      and a beautiful dark cloud-colored body.
      He is the god of the temple in southern Tirukāṭkarai
      and my dear life has joined him.

3737. When he embraced me and said,
      “See, I will embrace you and you will join with me completely,”
      I fell into my love for him and lost myself
      and the dark cloud-colored god came before me
      and swallowed me entirely.
      The god of Thirukāṭkarai is not easy to see.

3738. Saḍagopan of southern Thirukuruhur
      surrounded by strong walls
      composed a thousand good pāsurams
      on the lord who killed the cruel Asuran Kamsan.
      If people learn and recite these ten pāsurams
      they will have no future births.

3739. She says,
      “O lovely red-legged nārai birds!
      You come to these backwaters on the seashore
      and sit sweetly looking for your food.
      He danced on a pot and wears blooming thulasi garlands
      dripping with honey in his hair.
      Won’t you go as my messengers to him
      flying above my head through the sky with your friends
      and tell him of my love?”

3740. She says, “O kurugu birds
      who stay lovingly with your beloved mates
      and are never apart from them,
      he is blamed by my relatives
      and I am disgraced because of my love for him.
      Go to lovely Thirumuzhikkalam where he stays with his beloved wives
      and ask him ‘Am I not fit for your love?’”

3741. She says,
      “Am I not fit for his love?
      O kokku birds, kuruku birds
      searching for food in the abundant water by the shore,
      go and ask the lord of Thirumuzhikkaḷam
      why I am not fit for his love.
      His eyes are as lovely as blooming lotuses,
      his hands, legs, and mouth are as sweet as fruits
      and his handsome body is like the petals of a red lotus.”

3742. She says,
      “O lovely clouds in flourishing Thirumuzhikkaḷam,
      I have done so much bad karma!
      If you go as my messengers to the divine lord
      and tell him, ‘Give yourself to her,’
      are you worried that he will remove the brightness of your body
      and chase you away from the clear sky?”

3743. She says, “O bright clouds,
      who make fire-like lightning
      and move swiftly across the clear sky,
      I have done bad karma.
      Go as my messengers to the god of Thirumuzhikkalam
      who shines like a bright light and has curly hair
      decorated with flowers dripping with honey
      and tell him that I keep him always in my heart
      and think of it as the divine heaven of my lord.”

3744. She says,
      “O bees, go and tell my message faithfully
      to the lord with the goddess Lakshmi on his chest,
      the god of Thirumuzhikkaḷam surrounded by groves
      where you blow pollen from the flowers
      and sing and drink honey from the blossoms.
      Go and tell him that my shining bangles
      and the band around my waist are becoming loose.”

3745. She says, “O kurugu birds in your large groves,
      I have done bad karma.
      The famous lord of Thirumuzhikkaḷam with lotus eyes
      and a mouth shining like coral embraced my arms,
      took my bangles and the band around my waist and left me.
      Go to him as my messengers and tell him of my love
      and then come back and tell me
      the faultless answer he gave to you.”

3746. She says,
      “O male and female bees! O thumbi bees!
      You search for your food in the large groves
      and wander with happy hearts, joined together as couples.
      His body is as dark as the kaayaam flowers blooming in the forest
      and he wears a beautiful thulasi garland in his hair.
      Go and tell the god of Thirumuzhikaḷam
      surrounded by strong walls how I suffer from my love for him.”

3747. She says, “O young kurugu bird
      in a pond filled with water,
      the god of Thirumuzhikkaḷam carries a golden discus
      and wears a beautiful thulasi garland in his hair.
      Go and say to him,
      ‘Her round ornamented breasts have grown pale
      and her flower eyes are filled with tears.
      It isn’t fair that you loved her and left her.’”

3748. She says, “O swans
      who search for your food on the wide shores of the water
      and walk gently with your beloved flock and are happy,
      go and tell the lord of Thirumuzhikkaḷam
      that she is weak, the band around her waist has grown loose,
      and she is barely alive.
      It isn’t fair that you loved her and left her.”

3749. Saḍagopan from faultless flourishing Thirukuruhur
      composed a thousand eternal pāsurams
      describing a girl who loves the god and prattles on like a parrot,
      continually uttering sweet words and praising the lord
      of everlasting Thirumuzhikkaḷam.
      If devotees learn and recite these ten pāsurams,
      their sicknesses will go away.

3750. If devotees keep the lord in their minds
      and think only of him their karma will go away.
      When will the day come when I, so unworthy,
      can approach Thirunavay,
      surrounded by fragrant cool blooming groves.

3751. He is the beloved of Lakshmi staying on a lotus,
      her waist as thin as a vine,
      and the beloved of lovely Nappinnai
      with large sharp spear-like eyes.
      When will I, his slave, approach Thirunāvāy
      where the lord Nediyān stays, surrounded by groves?

3752. I think always in my faultless mind,
      “When will the day come that I go to the god?”
      and I shed tears and suffer.
      I don’t know when I will go
      to the faultless divine Naraṇan of Thirunāvāy.

3753. O god, you are the beloved of lovely Nappinnai
      with large sword-like eyes and you stay in Thirunāvāy
      surrounded by tall blooming groves.
      I have begun to serve you and do not want to leave you.
      I don’t know how long my life will last.

3754. He is the beloved of Lakshmi,
      he is as precious as her eyes to the earth goddess,
      and he is the soul of all the creatures of the world
      and the god of the gods in the sky.
      When will the day come that I can go to him
      who loves to stay in Thirunāvāy
      and my eyes can have the joy of seeing him?

3755. I have became a faultless devotee to serve you
      and my eyes see you here and are happy.
      You, the lord of the cowherds, stay in Thirunāvāy
      surrounded with blooming groves where the bees sing.

3756. As a dwarf you took the land from king Mahābali,
      and you destroyed the Asurans when the gods fought them.
      O Thirumāl, Nambi Narayaṇan of Thirunāvāy,
      come to me, give me your grace and say, “This is my devotee!”

3757. Whether you give me your grace or not,
      make me your devotee and let me stay beneath your golden feet.
      Give me a clear mind
      so I may keep you in my heart and not be confused,
      O my god of Thirunāvāy.

3758 The gods and the sages could not see
the ancient one of the three gods
and ruler of all the three worlds.
Thirunāvāy is where he loves to stay—
how can we go and see the god? It is a pity!

3759. I suffer in my mind and call you, saying, “O Thirumāl!”
      and I ask you when the day will come that I can come to you
      who have the color of a beautiful dark jewel
      and stay in Thirunāvāy where the groves bloom with bunches of flowers.

3760. Saḍagopan of flourishing southern Thirukuruhur
      filled with palaces studded with precious jewels
      and surrounded by strong walls
      composed a thousand musical Tamil pāsurams.
      If devotees learn and recite these ten poems
      they will rule the earth for many years
      and their fame will spread like the fragrance of jasmine.

3761. She says,
      “The breeze with its jasmine fragrance adds to the pain of my love,
      the beautiful kurinji music hurts my ears,
      the evening when the sun sets with its red rays makes me dizzy
      and the beautiful red clouds kill me.
      My dear lotus-eyed Kaṇṇan, the bull among the cowherds,
      the Māyon, the heroic lion, embraced my breasts and arms.
      Now I am lonely and don’t know where I will find refuge.”

3762. She says,
      “I am lonely and I don’t know where I will find refuge.
      The lovely breeze makes me prattle and suffer,
      the evening when the sun sets
      and cooling sandal paste make me hot,
      and the music of the panchama raga
      and the fragrance of jasmine give me pain.
      Māyon, the cowherd, created this wide world,
      split it open when he took the form of a boar,
      swallowed it, spit it out and measured it.
      He gives his grace to all.
      When the Asurans come to fight with him he is Yama for them.
      He doesn’t come to see me. Why do I keep on living?”

3763. She says,
      “Why do I keep on living?
      The thief Kaṇṇan embraced my chest,
      pressing my breasts and making my small waist tremble.
      He loved me dearly and left me.
      A young lion, he, Māyan, does not return,
      but his lotus eyes, red mouth, dark handsome hair
      and his four arms stay in my mind and make me suffer.
      I am pitiful.”

3764. She says,
      “All the forms he takes stay in my mind and give me pain.
      The cool wind blows and makes me hot,
      the cool moon rises and is hot for me,
      and my bed, spread with soft flowers, is burning.
      He came and took my chastity
      like a divine bee with pure wings that loves flowers.
      My life isn’t in my hands
      and my heart doesn’t help me but makes me suffer.”

3765. She says,
      “My heart doesn’t help me, it only troubles me
      and the evening when the cows return home is painful for me.
      Is the heart of the cowherd I love a stone?
      The sweet music of his flute hurts me.
      My friends are my only help and they worry for me.
      How can I protect my dear life?
      It is hard to receive his grace
      but that is be the only thing that will save me.”

3766. She says,
      “It is hard to get his grace,
      but any grace but his is not really grace.
      Unless I receive his grace my soul won’t join him.
      My heart cannot bear the hot sun and the evening.
      His divine body where Shiva, Nānmugan
      and the beautiful Lakshmi stay attracts my life.
      O mothers, where will I go to find a refuge?
      What should I do?
      To whom should I tell my pain?”

3767. She says,
      “O mothers, who can I tell how I suffer from love?
      What should I say? My life is almost over.
      The dark cloud-colored Kaṇṇan
      has captured my dear heart and it has gone to him.
      The breeze that carries fresh fragrance
      with the smoke of incense sticks,
      the panchamam music from the yaaz,
      the fragrance of cool fresh sandal paste,
      the smell of beautiful jasmine—
      all come and seem to fight me.”

3768. She says,
      “The breeze carries fresh fragrance and overwhelms me
      and the cool young wind is like red fire for me.
      Our Kaṇṇan came, loved me and left like a thief.
      His naughty deeds are terrible.
      The fragrance of new jasmine dripping with honey,
      the gentle breeze, sandal paste,
      music in the panchamam raga all make me suffer.
      That thief gives his grace
      and plays sweet music on his flute for the cowherd girls.
      I cannot hear it and survive.”

3769. She says,
      “I cannot hear that sweet music and survive.
      When he plays on his flute, he speaks to us as he plays,
      sending his eyes as messengers to say something to us
      and playing his music as if he is talking to the cowherd girls, making faces.
      I can’t imagine how much the cowherd girls’ innocent hearts have suffered.
      The evening has come but Māyan has not yet come.”

3770. She says,
      “The evening has come but Māyan has not.
      The bulls with their large bells have reached home,
      the lovely cows that saw their bulls jump in joy have come,
      and the music of the flutes makes me prattle on.
      Bees sing and fly around thriving jasmine and mullai buds
      while the ocean looks at the sky and roars.
      What can I say to survive now that he has left me?”

3771. Saḍagopan Māṛan of beautiful Thirukuruhur
      composed a thousand pāsurams on the god
      who swallowed all the seven worlds and spit them out,
      describing how the cowherd girls felt sad when he left them.
      Ornamented with beautiful jewels,
      they could not bear separation from Kaṇṇan
      and felt they could not live.
      O devotees, learn these ten pāsurams, recite them
      and worship him and you will be saved.

3772. Worship in the evening to remove the results of your karma.
      In the morning and evening place lotus flowers
      at his feet and worship him who slept on a banyan leaf
      and is the god of Thirukkaṇṇapuram surrounded with walls
      where the ocean waves come and break.

3773. Worship the god with flowers dripping with honey.
      O devotees, every morning when you get up
      worship the feet of the god of Thirukaṇṇapuram
      surrounded by tall walls that touch the stars
      where crabs swim in the water in the fields.

3774. O devotees, pour water, place fresh blooming flowers at his feet,
      and worship him and he will remove your sorrows,
      the god of the gods of Thirukkaṇṇapuram
      surrounded by groves where bees sing.

3775. He, the beloved of the beautiful doe-eyed Nappinai,
      is as sweet as honey—worship him
      whose feet are the refuge for his devotees,
      pouring water and placing fresh flowers at the feet
      of the god of Thirukkaṇṇapuram
      surrounded by walls that reach the sky.

3776. He loves all devotees who approach his feet
      and grants them moksha in Vaikuṇḍam when they leave this world.
      He, the friend of those who love him,
      is the god of Thirukannapuram surrounded with strong fort-like walls.

3777. If devotees approach his feet, he becomes their friend
      and if they believe in him, he is real for them.
      He is a dear friend, the god of Thirukkaṇṇapuram
      surrounded by shining walls covered with gold
      who split open the chest of the Asuran Hiraṇyan
      that was as strong as pure gold.

3778. If devotees believe in him and worship him,
      he is real for them
      but if anyone worships him without true devotion,
      he is not real for them.
      The god of Thirukaṇṇapuram
      where vālai fish frolic in the fields
      is near to those who embrace him in their hearts.

3779. If devotees approach his feet every day
      he will remove their sickness
      and give his grace so they will not be born again.
      Bow to the feet of the highest lord of heaven
      of Thirukkaṇṇapuram
      surrounded by walls studded with precious stones
      and covered with gold.

3780. People will have no trouble
      if they have taken refuge in the ancient lord
      of Thirukaṇṇapuram where Vediyars
      recite the Vedas and live happily
      and their sicknesses will go away
      if they worship the feet of the lord every day.
      I will not have trouble in my life.
      There is nothing for me to worry about.

3781. I will have no trouble in my life
      and there is nothing for me to worry about.
      If devotees every day praise Thirukkaṇṇapuram
      where the god stays with Lakshmi on his chest
      surrounded by stone walls
      they will have no trouble in their lives.

3782. Saḍagopan from Thirukuruhur filled with tall palaces
      composed a thousand Tamil pāsurams.
      If you want to be without trouble and remove your karma
      sing these ten pāsurams and dance and worship his feet.

Divyaprabandham -Thiruvaymozhi
Pattām Pathu

3783. He who destroys the Asurans
      and has the color of a dark cloud,
      a mouth sweet as a fruit, lotus eyes, curly hair and four arms
      stays happily always in Thirumogur
      surrounded by flourishing fields and ponds
      blooming with lotuses on stalks.
      I have no refuge but the dark cloud-colored god.

3784. My father, the god with a thousand names
      adorned with a cool thulasi garland and precious ornaments,
      is my only refuge for all my births.
      There is no help for me except the shadow of the feet
      ornamented with sounding anklets
      of the god of Thirumogur where Vediyars live
      who know all the four good Vedas.

3785. When Brahma, Shiva and the other gods
      came to you and stood before you crying,
      “We have no refuge!”
      he, the god of divine Thirumogur, fought
      and conquered all the enemies of the gods,
      protecting the three worlds and saving them.
      We will go to Thirumogur
      and our troubles will be removed.

3786. The gods and sages went to the lord
      shining as a bright light and praised him, saying,
      “Give us your grace and remove our troubles!”
      and he removed their troubles.
      O devotees, come, let us go there and worship our god
      who rests on the snake bed in Thirumogur.
      and our troubles will go away.

3787. O devotees, come.
      He, the first ancient lord, shining like a bright light,
      who measured all the three worlds and the sky,
      is the god of the temple in beautiful Thirumogur
      where abundant sugarcane and good paddy grow.
      Let us go there, circle the temple,
      worship the lord and dance the kuthu dance.

3788. He who dances the kuthu dance and grazes the cows
      is Yama for the Asurans, destroying them all,
      and he is joy for sages, gods and those who praise him,
      the god of Thirumogur
      surrounded with flourishing cool fields and water ponds.
      There is no protection except the lotus feet of the god, the friend of all.

3789. We have no protection but him.
      He created the sky, the wide worlds and the oceans around them
      and the ancient sages and other gods.
      He, the creator of all the world,
      stays in beautiful divine Thirumogur.
      If we go there and circle the temple
      all our troubles will swiftly disappear.

3790. O devotees, come and worship
      the one with a thousand names
      who destroys the mighty Asurans
      and all your troubles will swiftly disappear.
      Worship the son of Dasarathan
      shining like a precious emerald
      of beautiful Thirumogur
      surrounded by rich ponds and tall groves.

3791. The divine god, the king, with beautiful feet,
      lotus eyes, a mouth red as coral
      and four large ornamented arms
      destroyed the mighty Asurans.
      Thirumogur surrounded by blooming groves is near.
      Let us go there and gain his good protection.

3792. O devotees, when the gods, afflicted by the Asurans,
      went to our lord in fear and asked for help,
      he took any form he desired and showed them his grace.
      Think only of the many names of the god
      of Thirumogur, recite them and praise him.

3793. Saḍagopan of Thirukuruhur
      composed a thousand pāsurams
      on the lord who danced on a pot, saying,
      “O devotees, praise him!”
      If devotees recite these ten pāsurams
      on the god of flourishing Thirumogur
      they will have no trouble in their lives.

3794. If you say, “Kesavan!” all your troubles will disappear
      and the cruel messengers of Yama will not be able to approach you.
      Today itself let us go to Anandapuram surrounded by fields
      and ponds where surumbu bees sing
      and let us praise Māyan, our god who likes to rest on the snake bed.

3795. You will have no trouble for all your seven births
      if you go to Anandapuram, a place filled with mountain-like palaces and groves
      where kurundu, cherundi and punnai flowers bloom in the courtyards.
      If devotees think of even one of the thousand names
      of the Māyan, the lord of that place, they will reach the world of the gods.

3796. He rides on a eagle and carries an eagle flag
      and he swallowed all the worlds and spat them out.
      If you go to rich Anandapuram at once and worship him
      all the troubles from your bad karma will disappear.
      I want you to realize that this is certain.
      Praise one of the thousand names of the lord.

3797. Devotees with much good karma
      sprinkle flowers and, without holding back,
      worship the god of beautiful Anandapuram
      surrounded with fields and fragrant groves
      and the ocean with its abundant water.

3798. If you do good karma, sprinkle flowers with good water
      and think of the names of our father,
      your births will be removed—this is certain.
      I am telling you so that you will know.
      If devotees approach and worship the lotus feet
      of the highest god of Anandapuram surrounded by thick groves,
      they will join the gods in the sky.

3799. The king of the gods gives his grace
      in everlasting Anandapuram to the gods of the sky
      who have come there, wander and perform worship for the lord.
      O devotees, listen to what I say.
      We should go and approach Govindan
      who took away the affliction of Shiva, the father of Kumaran.

3800. The highest god rests on a snake bed
      and created all the creatures of the world and the gods,
      and he, Govindan, removes the troubles of his devotees.
      If we go and sweep the front of the temple
      in beautiful Anandapuram surrounded by fields
      where vālai fish frolic in the streams
      all our bad karma will go away.

3801. O devotees, I want you to know this.
      Go to see the feet of the strong bull-like god
      in beautiful Anandapuram,
      the place of the god who is the father of Kama
      where he rests on a snake bed
      and your bad karma will go away.

3802. Gather fresh fragrant flowers to sprinkle
      on the feet of our god Vamanan
      and put out incense and worship his feet.
      If you go to Anandapuram
      surrounded by thick blooming groves
      and worship the lord,
      all your karma will go away.
      I have been saying this for a long time—
      there is only a little time left.

3803. If you worship every day saying,
      “Madhava!” your karma will be destroyed.
      Gather faultless lotus flowers, incense, sandal paste
      and lamps and take them to worship our father,
      the god of Anandapuram surrounded by golden walls.
      If devotees go there and worship the lord
      they will have endless fame.

3804. Saḍagopan of Thirukurugur
      surrounded by groves with bunches of blooming flowers
      composed a thousand pāsurams on the ancient god
      of Anandapuram that has endless fame.
      If devotees learn and recite these ten pāsurams
      they will go to the world of the gods and enjoy women
      who have bamboo-like arms and beautiful bangles.

3805. She says,
      “My bamboo-like arms have become thin.
      The lovely cuckoo birds keep on cooing.
      They do not understand
      how I have grown thin and how lonely I am.
      The beautiful peacocks hear the cuckoos and dance,
      yet you go to graze the cattle.
      For me one day passes like a thousand eons.
      You attract us with your lotus eyes.
      O Kaṇṇan, this isn’t fair, it isn’t fair.”

3806. She says,
      “O Kaṇṇan, this isn’t fair, it isn’t fair.
      Whenever you embraced me my joy increased like a flood
      and I couldn’t think of anything.
      Afterwards, I felt it was only a dream.
      As joy entered my heart more and more,
      O god, it was more than the joy of entering moksha.
      When you go to graze the cows
      I cannot bear to be apart from you.”

3807. She says,
      “When you go to graze the cows you take my life with you,
      my heart burns and I have no one to help me.
      I am here and cannot see your body that is dark as kohl.
      Even though you go away for only one day,
      I feel like it is an eon
      and the tears do not stop from my eyes, shaped like fighting fish.
      We who were born as cowherd women
      and are like his slaves are alone.”

3808. She says,
      “O Govindan, we are lonely without you
      and you don’t think of us.
      You love to graze the cows, taking them with you
      and leaving us here alone.
      Your words that are as sweet as ripe fruits
      enter my heart like a flood of juice flowing from those fruits.
      My heart burns when I think of the tender cheating words
      that come from your red mouth that is as sweet as nectar.
      I am pitiful.”

3809. She says,
      “Whenever I think of your sweet words my heart burns.
      O Kaṇṇan, you went out at daytime to graze the cows,
      and now the jasmine buds bloom spreading fragrance in the wind
      as the terrible evening fights with me.
      Come and embrace our beautiful breasts with your ornamented chest
      that spreads the jasmine smell of your garlands
      and give us the nectar of your mouth.
      Put your lovely lotus hands on our heads to adorn them.”

3810. She says,
      “Put your lovely lotus hands on our heads to adorn them,
      O Kaṇṇan with a beautiful discus.
      There are many girls who want to rub your feet gently.
      I cannot bear the love I have for you.
      The tears from my wide pretty eyes do not stop
      and my mind cannot stop loving you.
      We suffer all day when you go to graze the cows
      and my life melts like wax in fire.”

3811. She says,
      “My life melts like wax in fire,
      my precious bangles and mekalai ornament become loose,
      my pretty eyes shed pearl-like tears,
      the color of my breasts grows pale
      and my arms become weak.
      You, colored like sapphire, happily go and graze the cows
      even though your soft flower-like feet hurt.
      What will you do if the strong Asurans come to fight with you there?”

3812. She says,
      “I suffer when I think,
      ‘What will you do if the strong Asurans come to fight with you there?’
      Don’t go behind the cows to graze them.
      The love and weakness I have for you make me suffer.
      Don’t leave me.
      With your lotus eyes, your mouth, hands
      and the silk clothes you wear
      you attract us young cowherd girls.
      Our thin waists may break if we give in to your wiles.
      Give us a place with those you love.”

3813. She says,
      “We see that you wander
      with the cowherd girls and are happy with them.
      How can they steal your heart when we cannot?
      O dear god, do not go to graze the cows.
      Asurans sent by Kamsan may come in different forms and hurt you.
      If they catch you, you will be in danger.
      Dear one, listen to what I say.”

3814. She says,
      “Dear one, hear what I say! You will be in danger.
      The Asurans with their powerful arms have been sent by Kamsan
      and will come to give you trouble.
      Even sages are terrified when they see them.
      You wander by yourself without your brother Balarama
      and you will be alone.
      My heart suffers thinking how you will be in danger.
      You like to graze the cows more than you enjoy staying in the highest heaven,
      O god of the cowherds with a mouth that is sweet as a fruit.”

3815. Saḍagopan, the famous poet
      of flourishing southern Thirukurugur
      where the seashore is filled with conches
      composed a thousand pāsurams worshiping the divine feet
      of the cowherd whose red mouth is sweet as a fruit.
      These ten pāsurams describe how the cowherd girls are distressed
      when he goes to graze the cows and they are separated from him.

3816. Worshiping the feet of Damodharan
      is the only way to perform tapas to him,
      the discus-carrying one
      who has the color of dark clouds and lotus eyes
      and is water, sky, earth, fire and wind.
      He has such fame that all the gods in the sky
      repeat his names and praise him.

3817. He is praised by all the gods in the sky
      yet it is impossible for them to see him.
      If devotees do not embrace him in their hearts
      they will not be able to see the beautiful lotus-eyed Maal
      and lovely Lakshmi who stays on his chest as he embraces her.
      He destroyed my good and bad karma and rules me here.

3818. I will worship the feet
      of the ruler of all who carries a discus
      and place them on my head.
      We will not suffer trouble from anyone
      and we will not be born on this earth
      because the sorrows that births give are gone.
      Beautiful Nappinnai, the beloved of the lord,
      has lovely eyes like shining kendai fish.

3819. I place the feet on my head
      of him who rests on a banyan leaf
      and stands in the Venkaṭam hills
      as the gods in the sky worship him.
      He stays in my heart
      and I am sure that no trouble will come to me.

3820. I am sure that the highest lord who carries a discus
      will not leave my heart.
      The lovable one resting on a snake bed
      is truly a thief—he tells lies as if they were true
      and no one knows what he is doing.

3821. I worship the feet of our father
      who rests on a snake bed
      and keeps in his body Shiva,
      adorned with the crescent moon
      that brightens the sky in his matted hair.
      If devotees embrace him in their hearts,
      he gives his grace to them

3822. O heart, if you worship the highest of the highest lords,
      the shining light that destroys the births of his devotees,
      no sickness will come to you.
      He, my father, Madhusudanan who carries a heroic discus
      is pure precious gold.

3823. O heart, praise his feet and live
      without forgetting the lord
      who carries a discus in his hand
      and is beyond even all the gods of the sky.
      When the world ended, only he lived,
      and then he created the whole world again,
      he who grazed the cows
      and lifted Govardhana mountain with his strong arms.

3824. As soon as I found the lotus feet of the lord
      and saw him all my karma was destroyed.
      I worship him and live serving others always
      as the highest lord has commanded us to do
      from ancient times.

3825. Thinking only of him in their hearts,
      the gods in the sky in all the directions
      worship Madhavan every day
      with fragrant smoke, lamps, fresh flowers and water.
      He is the only refuge for all his devotees,
      the only thing they can hold on to.

3826. Saḍagopan of the flourishing Pandyan country
      composed a thousand pāsurams with beautiful words
      in the andadi metre on the highest of the high
      whom he took as his refuge.
      If devotees learn and recite these ten pāsurams
      they will reach Kaṇṇan’s ankleted feet
      and he will be their refuge.

3827. O devotees,
      your minds should think only of joining the feet of Kaṇṇan
      and the only divine name you should think of is Nāraṇan.
      Trust in this and you will be taken to the feet to the god.

3828. He, our father Nāraṇan,
      is the origin of all the worlds
      who killed the elephant Kuvalayabeedām
      and rules the earth goddess.

3829. He is himself all the world
      and he rules all the worlds.
      He created the world, split it open,
      swallowed it and spat it out.

3830. The god rests on the ocean on a snake bed
      and rules the world.
      Place fresh flowers at his feet
      and worship him every day.

3831. Place fresh blooming flowers
      every day at his feet,
      worship him and recite his names
      and you will reach moksha.

3832. He is Madhavan,
      who, colored dark like a kaayaam flower,
      drank milk from the breasts of the devil Putana,
      the god who stays in the Thiruvenkaṭam hills.

3833. If you recite always the name of the lord saying,
      “Madhavan, Madhavan!”
      all your karma will disappear
      and no trouble will come to you.

3834. All who recite the names
      of the dark cloud-colored lord
      become gods in the sky.
      No troubles will come to them.

3835. The gods in the sky cannot know him
      yet he is easy for his devotees to know.
      If devotees worship the lord in the sky,
      the fruits of their karma will go away.

3836. Worship the lord Nediyān
      with beautiful flowers that have bloomed in springs
      and any good or bad karma that is like past or future darkness
      will give you no trouble and disappear.

3837. Saḍagopan, the devotee blessed by the god Neḍiyān,
      composed a thousand pāsurams on the highest god.
      If devotees learn and recite these,
      they will have the grace of the lord.

3838. I am a devotee of the devotees
      who have the grace of the lord
      who carries a discus and gives his grace to me.
      We will have his grace according to our fate.
      I do not want births on this earth that give sorrow in life.
      O ignorant heart! Don’t be confused.
      Worship the feet of the lord of Thiruvāṭṭaṛu.

3839. Worship the feet of the lord of Thiruvāṭṭāṛu
      and he will remove your births on this wide earth.
      O heart! Do you hear what I say?
      We sing many songs and praise our lord Kesavan
      and the results of all our karma have gone away.
      We have no desire and no relationship with the world
      and we have joined him.

3840. We praised his many names and approached Narayaṇan
      who has come to rich Thiruvāṭṭāṛu flourishing on this earth
      and remained there.
      Quickly, he will give his grace to his devotees
      so they can reach moksha.
      O heart, we will achieve what we want if we worship him.

3841. The lord who split open Hiraṇyan’s strong chest
      and fought in the Bharatha war for the Pandavas
      stays in my heart and inspires me to compose Tamil pāsurams.
      O good heart, our dear lord of Thiruvāṭṭāṛu
      truly gives his grace to us.

3842. He rides on beautiful Garuḍa
      and his shining feet are decorated
      with fragrant thulasi garlands dripping with honey.
      The lord of Thiruvāṭṭāṛu has placed his lotus feet on my head
      and will show me the way to moksha.
      O heart, I will not go to hell—let us laugh at it.

3843. My lotus-eyed father
      who broke the tusks of the murderous elephant
      and has placed both of his lotus feet on my head
      will not leave my heart but will remain there always.
      I have approached the feet adorned with sounding anklets
      of the lord of Thiruvāṭṭāṛu surrounded by hills and palaces
      who rests on a snake bed.

3844. I have approached the feet of Govindan
      adorned with sounding anklets
      and he has entered my heart and stays there,
      the god of Thiruvaṭṭāṛu surrounded by hills
      and oceans with roaring waves
      and filled with palaces studded with jewels,
      a place that is like a thilakam of the southern land.
      The fragrance of the thulasi on his lotus feet spreads everywhere.

3845. He is like a dark hill and carries a discus in his hand
      and his divine hair is beautifully decorated
      with fragrant thulasi garlands.
      He wishes to stay in Thiruvaṭṭāṛu
      surrounded by the ocean with roaring waves.
      What good karma I must have done!
      He shines and remains in my heart.

3846. The beautiful Thirumāl stays in Thiruvaṭṭāṛu
      and the goddess of wealth Malarmagaḷ
      resides on his divine shining chest.
      Riding on Garuḍa, he destroyed the clan of his enemies, the Asurans.
      He will never fail to love me
      and he will never leave my heart.

3847. He who became a man-lion
      and split open the chest of Hiraṇyan
      destroyed my births and, ruling me with love,
      will never leave me.
      He rests in Thiruvaṭṭāṛu on the snake Adisesha
      with a shining mouth and a lined body.
      If someone receives the grace of our dear god,
      he will have a reward that no one can obtain.

3848. Saḍagopan of rich Thirukuruhur
      composed a garland of a thousand Tamil pāsurams
      on our dear god of Thiruvaṭṭāṛu
      who showed his sounding anklets to his devotees
      and saved them from cruel hell.
      Even the gods in the sky are happy to hear
      these ten pāsurams that are sweet to the ears.

3849. O poets, you compose pāsurams with lovely words—
      be sure to take care of yourselves.
      He, the famous Māyan, the lord of Thirumālirunjolai,
      is a cheating thief and will enter your heart and life as a magic poet,
      staying there unknown to anyone,
      and he will devour your heart and life
      and fill them until there is nothing left there but him.

3850. He himself is all the world and the creatures in it.
      He is himself and he worships himself.
      He, the lord of Thirumalirunjolai,
      is my honey, milk, sugar juice and nectar.
      He swallowed all my life and went away.

3851. Entering my illusory body, he swallowed all my life
      He himself is me and he is Māyan, my father.
      I reached Thirumalirunjolai of the Pandyan country
      and worshiped the lord there folding my hands.
      Do I need to search for him anywhere else?
      Do I need to go somewhere to receive his divine grace?

3852. How can I describe the grace
      of him who wanders everywhere in the world
      and destroys the Asurans who do not approach him.
      He himself is the world and the creatures in it
      and he will not leave my body.
      He will not leave the hills of Thirumalirunjolai
      that shines as the thilagam of the southern land.

3853. Destroying the Asurans who did not come to him,
      he made the good gods in the sky happy.
      Sages think of his nature however they wish
      even though they do not know what it really is,
      and yet he still makes them happy.
      He, my father, the lord of Thirumalirunjolai
      sings pleasant songs to himself with music about himself
      with the sound “thennā, thennā.”

3854. He, the lord of Thirumalirunjolai,
      swallowed all the rich worlds
      and kept them in his huge stomach.
      He, the lord, the god Thirumal
      gives his grace to the world eon after eon
      and rules the world.
      Shiva and Brahma, unable to find his head or feet,
      worshiped him and he gave his grace to them.

3855. Thirumalirunjolai, the divine jewel-filled hill
      that takes away the ignorance of all,
      is where the three-eyed Shiva, the wise Brahma,
      Indra the king of gods, all the gods,
      and the sages who remove ignorance
      praise the lord saying, “O father, give us your grace!”

3856. The hill of Thirumalirunjolai
      and the divine milky ocean are my head
      and the lands of Thirumāl, Vaikuṇṭam and Thiruvenkaṭam are my body.
      Even for a moment he will not leave my illusory life,
      my mind, my words and my deeds,
      the unique one, the ancient one of the eon.

3857. He alone was left at the end of the eon
      who created, protected and destroyed all creatures
      at the end of the world.
      O mind, think only of beautiful cool Thirumalirunjolai
      where our father, the ocean-colored god, stays.
      Do not forget him. He is in your body and soul.

3858. There is no limit to your Māyai.
      You, our king of Thirumalirunjolai,
      are I and you have given me your grace.
      The five feelings—seeing, hearing, breathing, taste and touch—
      and the body parts—eyes, ears, nose, mouth and the part that acts—
      and five elements—sky, wind, sound, light and ether—
      and this life on earth, nature, the self, sense of ego and mind
      are all only you.

3859. Saḍagopan of Thirukkurugur
      surrounded by beautiful groves dripping with honey
      composed a thousand pāsurams praising the lord
      who, the creator of the mind and of all the five senses,
      destroys the feelings of the five senses and the ego-centered mind.
      If devotees learn and recite these ten pāsurams
      on Thirumalirunjolai surrounded by groves dripping with honey,
      the feelings of their senses and mind will be removed.

3860. When I said, “Thirumalirunjolai!”
      Thirumal came and entered my heart making it full,
      the god of southern Thirupperur where the water of the Ponni river
      brings large precious stones and leaves them on its banks.

3861. The lord of Thirupperur came, entered my heart
      and said,“I will not leave you!”
      Even though he swallowed all the seven clouds in the sky,
      the seven oceans, the seven mountains and the seven worlds
      it was not enough for him.
      I have caught him tightly in my heart and he stays there.

3862. I have caught him tightly and make him stay in my heart.
      My future births are destroyed and I will not get any sickness.
      No longer desiring illusory family life,
      it is easy for me to join his feet, the god of Thiruperur
      filled with palaces that have towers where flags fly.

3863. My heart and my eyes are delighted
      knowing that it is easy to reach the god,
      the lord of Thiruperur
      surrounded by groves where parrots fly
      who will give me heavenly moksha
      that is pure and divine.

3864. The god of southern Thirupperur
      surrounded by groves dripping with honey
      wished to give me moksha and came to me, entering my body
      and removing the karma that causes confusion.

3865. The god of Thirupperur
      who stays in the hills of Thirumalirunjolai
      came to me today, said, “I will stay with you!”
      and entered my heart, filling it.
      I received his love and am blissful, as if I had drunk nectar.

3866. Joyful because I drank his nectar,
      I am like the gods and need nothing.
      I serve him and in the evening I worship the god of Thirupperur
      surrounded by groves where joyful bees drink honey.
      He is happy to be before my eyes,
      never leaving my sight.

3867. He who is the seven musical notes
      stays before my eyes and does not leave.
      He is in all my thoughts.
      When you think of him, he may seem very subtle,
      yet he truly entered my heart today
      the god of Thiruperur surrounded by beautiful palaces
      studded with jewels and tall as a mountain.


3868. Entering my heart where I keep him,
      he has made me remarkable today.
      Why did he make me wander about
      involved in the pleasures of five senses?
      What did he gain by that?
      The lord of Thiruperur surrounded by shining hills
      that are like palaces gave me his grace
      and I understood why I was hurt by my senses.

3869. I served you, my father,
      and received the only thing I would ever want,
      the grace to worship your feet.
      If devotees give up their desire for the world
      and become the slaves of the lord of Thiruperur
      where Vediyars live who know the Vedas well,
      they will have no trouble in their lives.

3870. Saḍagopan of Thiruperur
      surrounded by flourishing fields and filled with good people
      composed a thousand Tamil pāsurams with beautiful words.
      If devotees learn and recite these ten Tamil pāsurams
      and serve the lord,
      they will go to the golden sky and rule there.

3871. When they see the devotees of my father Nāraṇan, praised by all,
      the beautiful clouds in the sky sound like drums,
      the deep oceans dance moving their waves like hands
      and all the seven worlds flourishing with groves feel joy.

3872. Seeing the devotees of Nāraṇan,
      the clouds filled with good water look like golden pots,
      the oceans filled with abundant water roar reaching up to the sky
      and the whole world puts up festoons of leaves and flowers
      and worships him.

3873. Sprinkling a rain of flowers and fragrances
      everyone in the world worships his devotees
      while sages stand at both sides of the devotees
      of him who measured the world and say,
      “Come, this is the way to Vaikuṇṭam!”

3874. The gods in the sky make places
      for the devotees to stay in front of them
      while the twelve suns show each one of them
      with their hand-like rays the way to moksha
      and the loud sound of the drums roars out
      like the roaring of the waves in the ocean.
      This is all for the devotees of Madhavan,
      adorned with thulasi garlands dripping with honey in his hair.

3875. The gods in the sky,
      knowing they are devotees of Madhavan,
      welcome them at the thresholds
      and say, “Come, enter our homes!”
      while the Kinnarars and Garuḍas sing songs
      and the good sages who know the Vedas
      perform sacrifices and worship them.

3876. The sages perform sacrifices
      and the fragrant smoke spreads everywhere.
      Some play music with kāḷams and valampuri conches
      while women with eyes like glistening swords
      praise them joyfully and say,
      “You, devotees of the discus-bearing lord,
      have come to rule the world of the sky.”

3877. The Apsarasas, the Maruts and Vasus
      sing the praises everywhere of the devotees of Kesavan,
      the lord of the cowherds
      who wears a shining crown studded with jewels
      and rests on the ocean in Kuḍandai.

3878. The gods in the sky wearing golden crowns
      welcome his devotees, praising them and saying,
      “These who come from the families of devotees
      are Govindan himself for us,”
      and the devotees of the divine Madhavan enter Vaikuṇṭam
      with towers and tall beautiful walls where flags fly.

3879. When his devotees enter Vaikuṇṭam,
      the gods in the sky come to the gate and say,
      “O devotees of the lord, you are our friends.
      May you come to our home.”
      Welcomed with wonder by the gods and sages,
      it is the good fortune of his devotees to enter Vaikuṇṭam.

3880. Good Vediyars wash the feet of his devotees, thinking,
      “These enter here because of their good fortune.”
      Women with beautiful moon-like faces
      come carrying precious things, fragrant powders
      and shining pots with water to welcome them .

3881. Saḍagopan of Thirukuruhur
      surrounded with groves blooming with clusters of flowers
      composed a thousand pāsurams with music
      describing how the devotees of the god
      come to the heaven of highest pleasure
      and how the gods welcome them
      in their beautiful jewel-studded maṇḍapams.

3882. O god, you are the sages,
      you are Brahma with faces in all directions
      and our father the three-eyed Shiva.
      A dark-colored shining jewel,
      you are a thief with a sweet fruit-like mouth
      and eyes as lovely as lotuses.
      I am alone, you are my life,
      and your divine feet are on my head.
      I will not let you go away.
      Don’t play your tricks on me.

3883. Don’t cheat me.
      I promise on Lakshmi who sits
      on your divine chest on a fragrant beautiful lotus.
      See, this is my promise,
      to be your friend, joining my life with you
      so we cannot be separated. Do not ignore me.
      Call me and join me with your feet.

3884. Call me and join me with you.
      You are a faultless dark jewel
      and I know no support for my life except you,
      the source of Brahma, Shiva, Indra
      and all the other gods who worship you
      as the root of all, O god of the gods in the sky.

3885. You, the precious source of the gods in the sky,
      the shining light in the sky, are inside all souls.
      You who are Brahma and Shiva
      created the sages, the gods in the sky,
      the cowherds and all others.
      I thought you would take care of me
      but you left me alone and went away.

3886. You left me and made me wander alone.
      How could I depend on you, my lord?
      There is nothing that belongs to me.
      What is there that I call “I”?
      What is the thing I call “mine”?
      You have become sweet nectar for me
      and you drink up my life
      as if it were water vaporized by hot iron.

3887. You, sweet nectar to me, are my soul,
      abiding as my sweet life and filling my heart.
      You must not go away from me,
      O god with the color of a kāyām flower,
      with lotus eyes and a red fruit-like mouth,
      lover of beautiful Lakshmi
      and loved by her, you are my dear one.

3888. You, my dear one, the beloved of beautiful Lakshmi,
      carried the earth with two tusks
      that were like two crescent moons
      when you took the form of a lovely boar
      that looked like a blue mountain,
      and you, my father, churned the blue milky ocean.
      I have you—how could I leave you.

3889. I have you—how could I leave you?
      You, my dear life, give both kinds of karma
      to the creatures of the world
      and are the life of the world,
      creating the lives in all the three worlds.
      You are inside the world yet no one knows where you are,
      the unique seed, the source of everything.

3890. You are the ancient seed of the world,
      the first one of all the three worlds.
      O matchless god, when will I come and join you?
      Souls wander here and there and waste their lives,
      but you, the unique one, are everywhere
      among the deep, wide, high places—you are endless.

3891. You are omnipresent and endless,
      the pleasure of bright knowledge,
      a divine beautiful flower and a light,
      spreading fragrance and brightness everywhere.
      You came to me, removed my desires and joined me.

3892. Saḍagopan composed a thousand andādi pāsurams
      and received moksha because he was without desire.
      He said, “You are omnipresent and have taken away my desires.
      You are Brahma, you are Shiva and you are Hari.”
      If devotees learn and recite these ten pāsurams,
      they will reach the gods in the sky
      even though they were born in this world.

SUBHAM - Nammāzhvare saraṇam.

---------------
## 24. Rāmānujanutrandadi /Thiruvarangathamudanār (3893 -4000)

(Important Note. All the pasurams of Divayaprabandham from 1 to 3892 by twelve (eleven?) azhvars only praise the god of Vaishnavism? But the last 108 pasurams are confusing that are composed by Thiruvarangathamudanar who was probably lived in later century than 9CE. Most of the pasurams in this text seem to praise the god and probably Ramanujar. One wonders when they say whether they say 'Ramanuja?' they really mean Rāmānujar? or the god. As much as I could understand all the commentators translate the word Rāmānuja as ‘emperumanar’ including Annagarāchariyar. The text does not say anything about Rāmānujar who lived later (1017 - 1137), the author(?) of Vishishṭadvaidam.

3893. O heart!
      He embraces Lakshmi on the lotus on his chest.
      Let us worship the feet of Māṛan,
      and ask for his grace.
      Let us approach the lotus feet of the lord
      and ask him for refuge.
      Let us recite the names of Rāmānuja.

3894. O good heart!
      I will not worship the feet of those
      who will not keep in their hearts the lotus feet of the god
      of southern Srirangam surrounded with groves that drip with honey.
      My heart will not think of anything
      except the good nature of Rāmānuja
      who loves and worships the feet of the lord.

3895. O good heart! I bow to your feet.
      You took me away from selfish people
      and made me join the devotees who have the fortune
      of worshiping the sage Rāmānuja of excellent fame.

3896. The lord made me a worthy person in this world
      and he removed the results of my bad karma.
      Now no one can cause me trouble
      because I am a devotee of the highest, the Rāmānuja.

3897. If people do not agree
      that Rāmānuja's devotees are their wealth
      and blame god’s nature, that is his praise nonetheless.
      His dear devotees recite only the lord's divine names.
      They love the devotees of the lord
      no matter what family they were born in.
      .
3898. Rāmānuja composed poems with music, prose
      and good meaning.
      My poor heart longs to praise Rāmānuja with the poems
      that I have learned and composed
      but it does not know how to describe his wonderful fame with love.
      I am making an effort with my poor heart, but I am not smart.

3899. No one can measure the fame of Kurathāzvān
      who has no pride and is above everything.
      I have approached his feet and am without worry.
      I sing the fame of the lord and have escaped the bad paths
      of life through the grace of our Rāmānuja.

3900. Poyhaiyāzhvār composed pāsurams in wonderful Tamil
      with the meanings of vedantha that shine like a bright lamp
      to remove the suffering in people’s lives.
      Rāmānuja, my lord, the highest, learned them all
      and kept them in his divine heart.

3901. Bhudathāzvār composed pāsurams
      that remove the darkness in the hearts of devotees
      and light up their wisdom, showing them the paths to find god.
      Good people worship the divine feet of Bhudathāzhvar
      in their hearts and praise the fame of Rāmānuja,
      keeping in their hearts his pāsurams
      that are as precious as the Vedas.

3902. Peyāzhvār, the composer of the finest Tamil pāsurams,
      saw in Thirukkovalur the lord who has abided with Lakshmi
      after the darkness that was created by the end of the eon disappeared.
      The devotees who praise those who worship
      the golden feet of Rāmānuja are fortunate.

3903. Thiruppāṇāzhvār composed pāsurams in good Tamil
      with the meaning of the four Vedas.
      I can’t describe the power of the devotees
      in this world that is as vast as the ocean
      who worship the lotus feet of Rāmānuja

3904. The famous Thirumazhisai Āzhvar
      praised the beautiful golden feet of the lord in his heart.
      I have only love and praise for the wise devotees
      who worship the divine sage Rāmānuja.

      adorned with flourishing thulasi garlands
      and composed divine Vedas
      and Tamil pasurams on the highest one.
      I worship the ankleted feet
      of the true sage Rāmānuja, my refuge.

3906. I do not do tapas on the oceans, in mountains or hot forests
      thinking that I have done bad karma.
      Rāmānuja, the highest,
      who, never tired of praising the devotees,
      bowed to the feet of Kulasekharar
      and sang his pasurams gives me courage.

3907. Periyāzhvar with his abundant love
      thought that Perumāl needs “Pallaaṇḍu”
      and composed pasurams on the lord
      that describe how the lord will live for ever.
      I will not join those who do not think of the shining fame of Rāmānuja
      who always praised Periyāzhvār.
      How could I have any trouble in my life?

3908. The lord of Srirangam saved the world at the end of the eon
      when it was destroyed by the flood and the Vedas disappeared.
      Rāmānuja, the sage praised by the world,
      is famous through the grace of Āṇḍāl who wore a garland
      that her father had prepared for the lord Rangan.

3909. The devotees of Thirumangai
      who praised the god of Thirukkaṇṇamangai
      with his beautiful Tamil pasurams will not suffer
      whether troubles come or joys come to them.
      They will approach Rāmānuja and praise him..

3910. Nammāzhvār composed a thousand pasurams
      that are like the Vedas, hard to compose,
      in sweet Tamil and spread them around the world.

      keep in their hearts the poet Saḍagopan
      who spread the fame of the highest lord.

3911. My lord, the beloved of Lakshmi seated on a lotus,
      who is my precious wealth and my father, mother and teacher,
      gave his grace to Nammāzhvār
      so that he could compose the Thiruvāymozhi, a classical Tamil jewel.
      Rāmānuja who spread the Thiruvāymozhi to the world is my sweet nectar.

3912. The lord gave his grace to Nādamuni
      who understood the sweetness of Tamil musical pasurams
      and spread among the people the Thiruvāymozhi
      of Nammāzhvār, born in southern Thirukkurugai.

3913. I will not suffer by going to the doorsteps of mean people,
      praising them and saying that they are clouds that pour wealth.

3914. Karthikeya, Ganesa the elephant god,
      three-eyed Shiva who carries fire in his hand,
      Shakthi and the village goddess all ran away
      from the battlefield after they came to help Vānāsuran
      when he fought with Thirumāl, the ruler of the three worlds,
      but the faultless god forgave the Asuran and gave him moksha.
      Rāmānuja who worshipped the lord is my wealth.

3915. I keep in my wicked heart Rāmānuja
      whom devotees keep always in their hearts like wealth,

3916. I have done much bad karma
      and have been born many times on the earth.
      I am tired of my life.
      I do not want to join the low religions whose people do false tapas.
      I worship Rāmānuja, the true wise devotee
      who is as generous as rain and I am saved.

3917. O Rāmānuja, as compassionate as a cloud,
      who knows the grace of the lord in this world surrounded by the ocean?
      I suffer in this world. Come and save me,
      O my dear sweet life.

3918. The generous cloud-colored lord
      removed all the troubles of my karma.
      Whatever family good people are born in,
      no matter what their nature or faults,
      the lord will give them his grace and accept them.
      The fame of Rāmānuja spreads everywhere.

3919. Generously, you give your grace unceasingly to your devotees.
      Even though I have done much karma, you entered the heart of me, your slave.
      My heart suffers thinking I am not worthy for you, the shining light, to enter it.
      O Rāmānuja, my poor heart is yours.

3920. My mouth will not praise the evil people
      who do not worship the feet of the faultless lord
      who grew angry at Kamsan, the enemy of the gods,
      fought with him and killed him.
      Our lord Kaṇṇan is the beloved of Nappinnai with beautiful soft cotton-like feet.
      My life is blessed.

3921. Rāmānuja, the devotee of the lord,
      who recited wonderful Tamil Pasurams like the Vedas,
      is famous and the god will give him moksha.
      Does my fate give me the fortune of worshiping the devotees
      who understand the fame of Rāmānuja?

3922. I will not worry even if I get the joy of attaining moksha
      or if I go to hell and fall into affliction.
      Rāmānuja, my friend and ruler, praised the lord saying,
      “In our ancient world, the Māyan is the king of all creatures.”

3923. O mind, we were born limitless times in this world
      and have suffered for many years, days,
      and months, and in the present.
      We approach the ornamented feet of the god of Thennathi, praised and loved by.

3924. If devotees approach Rāmānuja,
      they will obtain beauty, patience, strength, fame and perfect wisdom.
      He protects this earth where people suffer with poverty
      and he gives them his grace.

3925. In his hands, the beloved of Lakshmi
      carries a discus, a sword, a large club, a lovely shārngam bow
      and a curved conch that sounds in the battle.
      They all are really the forms of the sage Rāmānuja
      and they protect the world.

3926. Even though the lord destroyed of all his enemies,
      the poverty of the world did not go away,
      but Rāmānuja destroys the terrible poverty
      that afflicts the people of the world.
      If I praise Rāmānuja my poverty will be removed,
      and I will have a good life.

3927. On this earth I will not worship any other god except my lord.
      I will not compose poems praising some people
      saying that they are like generous clouds.
      I will never grow tired of worshiping the beautiful flower-like feet of the lord of golden Srirangam.
      Rāmānuja makes his devotees love him and I am his devotee.
      How could the results of my karma come to me?

3928. When the divine Vedas were hidden by an Asuran in the ocean,
      the lord with a heroic discus,
      the life of all the creatures in the world,
      saved and brought them up and taught them to the sages.
      The lord Rāmānuja taught the Vedas to people
      and spread them
      so that their ignorance will be removed.

3929. The Ramayana, famous all over the world,
      praises Rāmānuja who abides in a flood of devotion
      in the temple and in the hearts of the devotees.
      The good people whose hearts melt
      as they worship the lovely fragrant lotus-feet of the lord
      guided me and made me his devotee and I am happy.

3930. I thought that I am like god and can do anything
      but he made me understand that I am his slave.
      O lord, I was like that because you made me to stay away from you.
      I know you are compassionate
      and I do not understand why I had this trouble.
      O lord, you should tell me why you have not given your grace to me.
      You are Rāmānuja and you will not go against your promise.

3931. O heart, we always think of wealth, children, lands,
      and women with beautiful hair and want them,
      worrying about how to get them.
      Our lord removed our desires
      and the troubles that they give us and gave us knowledge
      to know what is good and what will bring us fame.

3932. The wise say that the four aims of life in this world,
      moksha, wealth, dharma and good kāma,
      are are given to us by our lord Kaṇṇan.
      Ramanuja, the good-natured one, Vāmanan, said,
      “Kāma is the desire of people to obtain things in this world,
      dharma removes the sins of the devotees,
      wealth is for giving to poor
      and the love for god gives devotees moksa.”

3933. Even though our lord Mādhavan was born in this world with various forms
      people do not understand that he is our god.
      After Rāmānuja appeared in the world,
      people gained wisdom and became the devotees of Nārāyaṇan.

3934. The faultless lord Rangan, the beloved of Lakshmi
      and the lord of all the creatures of the world
      released me from the desires
      that I had for women ornamented with beautiful jewels.
      Rāmānuja gave me his faultless grace.

3935. O people of the world,
      if you praise the divine form of the god and understand him,
      the results of your good and bad karma will go away.
      Worship Rāmānuja and your difficulties will be removed.

3936. The lord who is praised by countless good devotees
      is the scholar of all the three kinds of Tamil,
      the four Vedas and all good dharmic knowledge.
      The good people of the world will demonstrate to the bad
      that fortune is to recite the divine names of Rāmānuja.

3937. Devotees understand that there is
      no better fortune than your feet, our only refuge,
      and that you are the only path for them.
      There is no way I can describe in words how we feel about you.
      We understand the truth only through your good words, Rāmānuja.

3938. The poet Māran, composed pāsurams
      on our lord who created the Vedas
      and made all other religions disappear.
      The lord entered my heart and I worship him.
      I was ignorant but now I understand him.
      We praise Ramanuja whose excellent qualities
      make him famous in all directions.

3939. The highest lord Rāmānuja,
      praised by the people as the lord, Rangan,
      has entered my heart and stays there
      night and day without leaving.
      All my bad karma is destroyed
      and there is no one equal to me.

3940. I, a mean person, can be saved only by your grace—
      I have no other refuge.
      We both need each other.
      What is the use if you do not come and stay with me,
      O Rāmānuja, praised by faultless devotees?

3941. When Rāmānuja worshiped the ornamented feet
      of the god of Srirangam surrounded by fields
      where honey from lotus flowers flows like a river,
      the six false religions were destroyed
      and cruel poverty went away

3942. The feet of Rāmānuja flourish in the thoughts of good people
      and they disappear in the bad.
      Praised by sages from ancient times,
      they accepted my poor poems.

3943. Our lord, the king
      who fought for the Pandavas in the Bharatha war
      and drove the chariot for Arjuna,
      nectar for his devotees, was born as Rāmānuja.
      If I try to find the reason for his birth,
      I discover it was only to rule me.

3944. These are the wonders that Rāmānuja did for me.
      He destroyed the fame of the six religions
      and became known in all the world.
      He entered my heart,
      removed the results of my good and bad karma
      and made me joyfully join his feet.

3945. Rāmānuja, wonderful good-natured lord,
      is the highest one who created all the creatures of the world
      and is loved by learned people.
      He, as generous as a karpaga tree, came to rule me.

3946. Because of the good nature of Rāmānuja,
      the bad religions all disappeared,
      the Vedas that praise the lord Nāraṇan rejoiced
      and the divine Tamil Veda of the generous poet
      of southern Thirukkurugai flourished.

3947. He, generous as a cloud, showed his grace,
      saved all the Vedas at the end of the eon
      and gave them to the world.
      The devotees of the lord
      join together happily in southern Srirangam
      surrounded with fragrant groves that attract the eyes of all.
      The clan of the people who worship Rāmānuja is the family that rules us.

3948. He is the king of a cowherd village,
      the conquerer of Parasurāma praised by the whole world
      who defeatedtwenty-one generations of kings with his sharp mazu.
      I have approached that famous Rāmānuja—
      my tongue will not praise anyone else,
      and my mind will not think of anything else.

3949. Rāmānuja, praised by good people,
      believes that the devotees who worship
      only the lotus feet of the lord of Srirangam
      and no other gods are his relatives.
      I have approached him and he is my lord—
      I will not be ignorant any more.

3950. There are Vedanta scholars who say,
      “This is the meaning of the Vedas.
      The highest is Brahman and all the souls will leave the body
      and join the ancient Paraman.”
      Rāmānuja, the ocean of truth argued with them
      and defeated them in disputation about Vedanta.

3951. At the time the Advaita philosophy
      was spreading in all the eight directions
      surrounded with oceans
      and the darkness of poverty covered the world,
      if Rāmānuja had not removed the darkness with the light of his knowledge,
      no one would understand that the god who contains all life is Nāraṇan.

3952. The lord, who embraces Lakshmi on his golden chest
      abides in all the yoga of enlightened ones of true knowledge
      and in the sweet music of the Thiruvaymozhi.
      The fame of Rāmānuja, the tender shoot of our family,
      spreads everywhere.

3953. The lord came and gave his grace
      to save me from the results of my bad karma
      that burned like a hot fire.
      The fame of Rāmānuja whose tapas is praised by sages
      spreads like a light over this earth
      and the divine world has seen the wonder of it.

3954. I have removed the desire caused by my karma
      and have no worries.
      I worship only the feet of the devotees
      who praise the beautiful lotus feet of Rāmānuja—
      I will not worship the gods
      who do nothing good for the devotees of my lord.

3955. Give me your grace so I may follow
      your shining feet like a male elephant that follows his mate.
      Rāmānuja made the followers of the six dark religions
      run away and made others follow our lord’s religion.

3956. Our sage Rāmānuja, strong like an elephant dripping ichor,
      spreads in the world the joy of Tamil pasurams,
      the true Veda composed by Nammāzhvar.
      O you who want to argue, he will stand against you
      and defeat you with his philosophy.

3957. He argued with the scholars of other religions and defeated them.
      The Vediyars have been defeated
      and the earth is fortunate because of his tapas.
      Rāmānuja, whose philosophy has become famous,
      gave wisdom to good people
      and they spread it with their tongues and learned the sastras.

3958. Mādhavan gives moksha to his devotees
      as they become ever wiser.
      I have done bad karma.
      I pray that Rāmānuja will remove the faults of my heart
      and give me his grace.

3959. When the Pandava Dharma,worshiped the feet
      of the lord and asked for his help,
      Māyavan destroyed Duriyodhana
      and his hundred brothers in the Bharatha war.
      If Rāmānuja does not protect the people of the world
      who will protect them?

3960. The lord Māyan taught the Gita to Arjuna
      as they rode on a chariot in the Bharatha war.
      Rāmānuja spread the divine teaching of the lord in the world
      and I worship his feet.
      My life and thoughts bow to his devotees who worshiped him.

3961. When my senses hurt
      and I could not survive,
      the lord Rangan did not come to me and give me his grace
      but now my father Rāmānuja has come and helps me.

3962. You have countless wonderful qualities
      and you saw me and my nature and came to help me.
      Even considering my confused nature you gave me your compassion,
      O Rāmānuja, your devotees look at my faults with compassion and forgive me.

3963. My heart bows to your lotus feet.
      I love you and all my activities are for you.
      My love for your feet is strong
      and the results of my karma are removed through your compassion.

3964. If people follow other religions than our god’s,
      Rāmānuja dislikes them and he saves the people of the world from them.
      He thought only of the pure Vedic path.
      I praise the devotees of generous Rāmānuja whom he made me join.

3965. Rāmānuja with his ability, compassion and wisdom
      taught the people of the world truth and wisdom through his grace.
      Ramanuja gave true knowledge to all the devotees
      and I do not know any other way to be than to think of Rāmānuja.

3966. The lord Māyavan uses his discus and destroys
      bad people who do not know the path of the divine Vedas.
      Rāmānuja uses his wisdom and destroys
      those who do not know the divine Vedas.

3967. The lord of Srirangam on the banks of the Kaviri
      filled with pearls, fish and conches
      carries a discus and a conch in his hands and promises his devotees,
      “I will not leave you and I will remove your troubles.”
      O Rāmānuja, your beauty and fame come and surround me.

3968. The wide ocean and the golden hills of Thiruvenkaṭam,
      Vaikuṇḍam, the ocean of milk and the lotus feet of the lord
      all give pleasure to you, Rāmānuja,
      and you give me those pleasures also.

3969. Rāmānuja argued with the philosophers of other religions
      and became famous all through the world.
      He removed the results of my karma.
      How could he have done anything more for me?
      He gives me sweet grace that he gives to no one else.

3970. O Rāmānuja, concerned about my worries
      you removed the evil thoughts from my heart and helped me,
      making me a slave of the beloved of divine Lakshmi.
      No other thoughts enter my mind, only your true teachings.

3971. There are many religions that spread false teachings
      and people believe in them and do not think of the lord who will save us.
      Rāmānuja will show them the true way to reach god—
      they should give up their worrying and not doubt him.

3972. If the devotees worship the divine name of Rāmānuja
      and think of his power only
      I will be a slave for those good people.
      At all times, in all places, and in all conditions
      I will serve him tirelessly with my mind and body.

3973. You made me worship your feet
      and serve your devotees tirelessly,
      O Rāmānuja,who help people to approach
      the feet of the lord of Srirangam.
      I will not look for anything except your compassion
      and you will enable me to reach the lord.

3974. I wandered without good wisdom
      and suffered with the results of bad karma.
      I worshiped the divine name of Ramanuja,
      the virtuous one, generous as a cloud,
      and he made me a slave for those good people
      and made me to understand their matchless teachings.

3975. I do not want to join the people who think
      that if they do dharma, they will become famous
      and reach divine moksha.
      You know that, O Rāmānuja. You are generous as a cloud!
      Through your grace only I will reach your Vaikuṇṭam
      and worship your feet.

3976. I have known Rāmānuja and he knows me.
      When I received his grace and became his slave,
      the results of my bad karma went away,
      and even today I drink his flood of grace.
      I cannot describe all the beautiful things
      that I have received through knowing him.

3977. Devotees wander and suffer without knowledge
      if they do not understand that the lord, the highest light,
      is the inner meaning of the Vedas that are recited.
      Rāmānuja removed their ignorance
      and made them worship the feet of our lord.
      I have no refuge for my dear life
      except the feet of the devotees who worship the feet of the lord.

3978. From now on I will not wander, suffering
      and embracing those who do not love me,
      thinking they are my kin.
      I will consider only that my rulers are the learned ones
      who worship Rāmānuja in their hearts.

3979. Whether people are intelligent or ignorant
      they know Rāmānuja has a good nature and is famous.
      If people are unwise and do not learn the words of Rāmānuja,
      poverty will come to them.

3980. Rāmānuja, strong like a lion,
      learned the musical pasurams
      that are like paddy growing and flourishing in a field.
      I praise him as a tiger in disputing with others
      who know their religious sastras well.

3981. O Rāmānuja, no one can adequately praise your good nature—
      my praise cannot be commensurate with your fame.
      Whatever I do, my mind will not be happy without praising you,
      yet I am afraid that I am unable to praise you enough.
      What more can I do?

3982. The highest lord takes away the future births of his devotees.
      The lord Rāmānuja came to rule me in this world.
      If people do not worship the feet of the garlanded one
      they will be born again and suffer in this world.

3983. The virtuous Rāmānuja spread the fame
      of Rangan of Srirangam who gives grace to all his devotees,
      taking away the darkness of the world.
      He took away the teaching of the Vediyars,
      the scholars of the Agamas, that cause only confusion
      and made the world bright.

3984. I have not done proper nombus,
      or praised you well or worshiped your feet.
      O Rāmānuja of matchless fame,
      praised by good poets who know all the sastras,
      you have entered my heart and my eyes.
      Tell me the reason for this.

3985. Rāmānuja who did true tapas
      never says the errant sastras of other religions are true.
      He removes the results of bad karma for his devotees
      with his grace that is like a shining sword.

3986. Devotion to Rāmānuja will give tapas,
      wealth, good birth, good karma
      and devotion to the highest lord.
      The lives of those who approach him will be sweet like honey.
      My heart is happy, knowing nothing but his fame.

3987. Rāmānuja abides in the hearts of the people of the world
      and gives them whatever they need.
      He, the highest one, loves them and is the music of the world.
      He stays in the sky and gives moksha to all his devotees.
      He was born on the earth, taught the four Vedas
      and spread them.

3988. Rāmānuja, friend of devotees, takes care of those
      who grow old and suffer, lonely and wandering,
      because of the results of their bad karma,
      not knowing how they might obtain good karma.

3989. If they worship his lotus feet,
      Rāmānuja gives his grace to those living
      without any friends and relatives.
      His good nature knows those helpless people
      and he shows compassion to them all.

3990. Those who are born can only reach moksha,
      or go to hell to be born on the earth again and again.
      O mind, if you worship the lord
      he will give you Ramanuja,
      and you will not have any suffering.

3991. The Jains who argue for their beliefs,
      the devil-like Sakkiyars,
      the lazy devotees of Shiva with long matted hair,
      the Sunyavadins who believe in emptiness of the world,
      the learned one of the Vedas
      and low people who make mischief
      could not survive after Ramanuja,
      like a golden Karpaga tree, came into this world.
      They all disappeared.

3992. O Rāmānuja, my heart is a golden bee
      that worships your pure honey-like feet.
      I will not follow any other religion—
      no one can make me to learn their teachings,
      for I want only to drink in the sweet milk of your devotion.

3993. I was caught in my karma
      and born many times on this earth,
      but you have saved me, O Rāmānuja, from the results of my karma.
      Good devotees do not want to follow the doctrines of other religions
      that say following your teachings is wrong.

3994. Suffering with the results of my karma
      I worshiped you, calling out, “O lord, Rāmānuja!”
      and you helped me with your compassion
      in this world surrounded with oceans.
      My hands worship you and my eyes long to see you.

3995. The lord who took the form of an angry lion
      and split open the chest of Hiraṇyan,
      gave Rāmānja to the world whose fame that flourished like a crop in a field.
      As if he were putting a fruit in my hand and giving it to me,
      Rāmānuja gave me good wisdom
      and helped me remove the affliction of my karma.

3996. O Rāmānuja as generous as a rain-giving cloud,
      as if you placed a fruit in my hand and gave it to me,
      you showed me Kaṇṇan.
      I do not want anything except your grace.
      Whether I stay in the deep hole of hell,
      in heaven or in shining moksha,
      I will survive only if you give me your grace.

3997. The lord Māyan who rests on the milky ocean rolling with waves
      stays in the hearts of wise sages and those learned in the Vedas
      who worship the divine feet of Rāmānuja and dance praising him.
      Their place is the same as mine, for I am a slave of the god.

3998. Good devotees say the lord stays in Vaikuṇṭam,
      Venkaṭam and mountainous Thirumalirunjolai.
      Rāmānuja keeps that Māyan in his heart.
      He will enter my heart and give me pleasure.

3999. O lord, divine-natured Rāmānuja,
      even though I may be born in many places,
      suffer with sickness and die,
      I have one thing to ask.
      Make me the slave of your devotees
      and give me your grace so I will love them.

4000. O heart flourishing with devotion,
      let us praise Lakshmi, seated on the chest of the lord of southern Srirangam
      surrounded with fields where beautiful fish frolic.
      Let me worship the lord
      so I may approach the feet of illustrious Ramanuja.
