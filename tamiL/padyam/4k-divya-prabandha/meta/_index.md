- Pratibimba Lahiri : This magnum opus by Sri U.Ve. Villur Nadadoor Sribhashya Simhasanadhipati "Sahitya Vyakarna Vachaspati"  Venkataseshacharya Swami ( 1855-1934 CE) is translation of Tiruvaimozhi into Sanskrit Shlokas. In this work Swami translated complete Tiruvaimozhi into Sanskrit Prosody with appropriate Sanskrit prosody metre corresponding to each Tamil prosody metre used by Swami Nammazhwar in each decade of Tiruvaimozhi. Swami has also ensured that the meaning and gist of each pasuram as explained by various Purva Acharyas comes out clearly in Sanskrit translation.
