**[Tamil](/definition/tamil#history "show Tamil definitions") text and transliteration:**

மாலுக்கு வையம் அளந்த மணாளற்கு,  
நீலக் கருநிற மேக நியாயற்கு,  
கோலச் செந்தாமரைக் கண்ணற்கு,  
என் கொங்குஅலர்ஏலக் குழலி இழந்தது சங்கே.

mālukku vaiyam aḷanta maṇāḷaṟku,  
nīlak karuniṟa mēka niyāyaṟku,  
kōlac centāmaraik kaṇṇaṟku,  
eṉ koṅkualarēlak kuḻali iḻantatu caṅkē.

**English translation of verse 6.6.1:**

Engrossed is my daughter, whose fragrant locks are with flowers bedecked,  
In the [cloud](/definition/cloud#history "show cloud definitions")-hued Lord with lotus eyes red,  
The Spouse, Who the entire Earth once measured,  
Full of love unto His devotees and she has her bangles lost.

#### Note

The Nāyakī withers down, as she gets absorbed in the Lord’s features, His attributes and deeds. The head acquires elegance because of the locks of [hair](/definition/hair#history "show hair definitions"). Again, that head is praiseworthy, which bows down in reverence and thus, locks which impart beauty to the head, correspond to the reverential attitude, which makes the head worth its while.
