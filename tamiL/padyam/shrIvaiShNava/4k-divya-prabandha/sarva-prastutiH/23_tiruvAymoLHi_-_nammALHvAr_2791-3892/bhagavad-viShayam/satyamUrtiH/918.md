பாவியேன் தன்னை அடுகின்ற கமலக் கண்ணதுஓர் பவளவாய் மணியே  
ஆவியே! அமுதே! அலைகடல் கடைந்த அப்பனே! காணுமாறு அருளாய் (2)

**English translation of verse 8.1.1:**

Tirumakaḷ and Mother Earth are Your Consorts Divine,  
(Befitting Your beauty and majesty), the Celestials are Your vassals,  
(Ever ready to do Your bidding) You are the Sovereign  
Of the three worlds, assume You can any Form at wiḷḷ;  
Your lotus eyes and coral lips peerless, however, [torment](/definition/torment#history "show torment definitions") this sinner’s soul,  
Oh, gem of a Lord, dear unto me like [life](/definition/life#history "show life definitions")! Nectar insatiable,  
Oh, Sire, You did the surging ocean churn, pray, let me behold you.

**Notes:**

The Lord has revealed Himself before the [Āḻvār](/definition/aḻvar#vaishnavism "show Āḻvār definitions")’s mental vision in all His might and majesty in that glorious setting; the Divine Consorts and the [Nitya](/definition/nitya#vaishnavism "show Nitya definitions") [Sūrīs](/definition/suri#history "show Sūrīs definitions"), who make the supplicant’s position safe and sound by virtue of their good offices, are around; the Lord is the Sovereign Master of all the worlds and apart from the immensity of His wealth, He is omni-potent, He churned the Milk-ocean once and delivered the ‘[Amrut](/definition/amrut#vaishnavism "show Amrut definitions")’ (ambrosia) to the self-centred and egotistic [Devas](/definition/deva#vaishnavism "show Devas definitions") and in spite of such an extremely favourable background, it is a pity He would not grant the wish of a selfless devotee of the eminence of Saint [Nammāḻvār](/definition/nammalvar#vaishnavism "show Nammāḻvār definitions"). While this very thought is depressing enough, the dejection gets accentuated when he muses over the Lord’s lotus eyes, coral lips and radiant Form which he could not currently behold. Of course, the Āḻvār doesn’t want the Lord to take, for his sake, the trouble of churning the ocean as He did for the selfish Devas, and all that He prays for is that he might be enabled to behold the Lord’s bewitching Form, so as to sustain himself.
