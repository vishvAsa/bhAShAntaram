**[Tamil](/definition/tamil#history "show Tamil definitions") text and transliteration:**

தலைப்பெய் காலம் நமன்தமர் பாசம் விட்டால்,  
அலைப்பூண் உண்ணும் அவ் அல்லல் எல்லாம் அகல,  
கலைப் பல் ஞானத்து என் கண்ணனைக் கண்டுகொண்டு,  
நிலைப் பெற்று என் நெஞ்சம் பெற்றது நீடு உயிரே

talaippey [kālam](/definition/kalam#history "show kālam definitions") namaṉtamar pācam viṭṭāl,  
alaippūṇ uṇṇum av allal ellām akala,  
kalaip pal ñāṉattu eṉ kaṇṇaṉaik kaṇṭukoṇṭu,  
nilaip peṟṟu eṉ neñcam peṟṟatu nīṭu uyirē

**English translation of verse 3.2.10:**

Miseries gruesome, like unto [yama](/definition/yama#vaishnavism "show yama definitions")’s yoke have ended,  
And seen have I kaṇṇaṉ, my beloved Lord,  
By many a sacred text comprehended;  
My mind is steady and my soul restored,  
To pristine [purity](/definition/purity#history "show purity definitions"), its due stature.

**Notes**

\(i\) Śrī Nampiḷḷai elucidates the context of this song, as follows:

Finding the [Āḻvār](/definition/aḻvar#vaishnavism "show Āḻvār definitions") in an extremely critical condition, the Lord calls upon him to enjoy His Iconic Form in Tiruvēṅkaṭaṃ and sustain himself. Thereupon, the Āḻvār feels greatly relieved and gives vent to his sense of relief, in this song.

\(ii\) Being away from the Lord is as gruesome as [suffering](/definition/suffering#history "show suffering definitions") from Yama’s yoke, the [tortures](/definition/torture#history "show tortures definitions") inflicted by Yama’s hordes.

\(iii\) Tirukkurukaippirāṉ Piḷḷāṉ, in his commentary known as Aṟāyirappaṭi, presents the current scene of reunion of the Lord and the Saint as follows:

The Lord seems to have got frightened of His own loss of reputation when an ardent devotee, who has taken refuge at His feet, is left in the lurch, exposed to the vagaries of Yama’s assistants. C.F. [Śloka](/definition/sloka#vaishnavism "show Śloka definitions") 25, of Saint [Yāmuna](/definition/yamuna#vaishnavism "show Yāmuna definitions")’s Stotra [Ratna](/definition/ratna#history "show Ratna definitions").
