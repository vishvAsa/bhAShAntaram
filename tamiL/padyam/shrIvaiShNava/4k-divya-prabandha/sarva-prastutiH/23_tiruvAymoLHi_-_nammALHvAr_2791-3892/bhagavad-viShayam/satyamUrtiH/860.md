**[Tamil](/definition/tamil#history "show Tamil definitions") text and transliteration:**

ஏற்றுஅரும் வைகுந்தத்தை அருளும் நமக்கு, ஆயர்குலத்து  
ஈற்றுஇளம் பிள்ளைஒன்றாய்ப்புக்கு மாயங்களே இயற்றி,  
கூற்றுஇயல் கஞ்சனைக் கொன்று ஐவர்க்காய் ஆக்கொடும்சேனைதடிந்து,  
ஆற்றல் மிக்கான் பெரிய பரஞ்சோதி புக்க அரியே

ēṟṟuarum vaikuntattai aruḷum namakku, āyarkulattu  
īṟṟuiḷam piḷḷaioṉṟāyppukku māyaṅkaḷē iyaṟṟi,  
kūṟṟuiyal kañcaṉaik koṉṟu aivarkkāy ākkoṭumcēṉaitaṭintu,  
āṟṟal mikkāṉ periya parañcōti pukka ariyē

**English translation of verse 7.6.10:**

Surely, we will be granted the [Heaven](/definition/heaven#history "show Heaven definitions"), difficult to attain,  
By the merciful Ari, Who entered Gokul as a Babe just born,  
Worked many a wonder ere the devilish Kañcaṉ was by Him slain,  
Got the armies of the cruel enemies routed, as a Partisan  
Of the five brothers and repaired back to the High Heaven,  
Still feeling that enough unto them hasn’t been done.

**Notes:**

\(i\) The [Āḻvār](/definition/aḻvar#vaishnavism "show Āḻvār definitions") is now placating his mind to which he had posed the question, as in the last song.

\(ii\) [Kṛṣṇa](/definition/krishna#vaishnavism "show Kṛṣṇa definitions"), as a mere Babe and later, as a Boy, worked many wonders culminating in the slaying of the fiendish [Kaṃsa](/definition/kamsa#vaishnavism "show Kaṃsa definitions") who had tried all methods he could possibly conceive of, to do away with the Divine Child. And when Kṛṣṇa came of age, He controlled the wonderful military strategy in that great battle at [Kurukṣetra](/definition/kurukshetra#vaishnavism "show Kurukṣetra definitions") and led the Pāṇḍavas to victory against the evil-minded [Kauravas](/definition/kauravas#vaishnavism "show Kauravas definitions"). Having done so much, the Lord still felt He had not done enough unto His devotees. How magnanimous of Him! And what more? Even after His return to Heaven, His fury over the demoniac Kaṃsa, [Duryodhana](/definition/duryodhana#vaishnavism "show Duryodhana definitions") etc., remained unabated.
