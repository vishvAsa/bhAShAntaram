**English translation of verse 9.7.5:**

Ye, lovely [clouds](/definition/cloud#history "show clouds definitions"), speeding across the immaculate sky,  
Holding in your bosom, lightning like unto the arc fiery!  
Convey my message, will you unto the Lord resplendent,  
Who is in Tirumūḻikkaḷam resident,  
Whose locks shed honey in plenty and Who in this sinner’s heart dwells  
With all the affection He bestows on the [heaven](/definition/heaven#history "show heaven definitions") impeccable.

**Notes:**

\(i\) Seeing that the clouds were rather diffident of being heard by the Lord, the Nāyakī assures them of positive response by the Lord. The Nāyakī’s confidence stemmed from the fact that the Lord got Himself lodged in her heart with all the affection He bestows on His transcendent abode, called Heaven.

\(ii\) The lightning appears in the clouds only when they are about to rain. The rain clouds, referred to, in this song, however, denote the great preceptors, resplendent like the Lord Himself, showering knowledge on the disciples, all over.

\(iii\) *This Sinner’s heart*: The sin, alluded to, is the Nāyakī’s inability to envision the Lord, although He is very much in her heart. One Ciṟṟāḻkoṇṭāṉ would say: “It is indeed a long distance between the actual realisation of God and the mere inward mental conception of the Lord. To aspire for the former, right when God-love blooms in one’s heart, is like opening a cloth-shop and announcing to the public that clothes are ready for sale while the [cotton](/definition/cotton#history "show cotton definitions") for these clothes is still lying raw in its pods on the [tree](/definition/tree#history "show tree definitions").” [As the Englishman would put it this is like attempting to sell the [lion](/definition/lion#history "show lion definitions")-skin even before the lion is hunted].

\(iv\) *Convey my message*: The message from one, on whose locks the flower has dried down to a mere shred, to Him whose, locks are bedecked with flowers, shedding honey profusely.
