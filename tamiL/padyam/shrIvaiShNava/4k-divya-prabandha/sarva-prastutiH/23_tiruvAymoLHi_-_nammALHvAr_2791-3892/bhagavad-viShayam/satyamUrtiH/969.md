In the third decad of this centum, the [Āḻvār](/definition/aḻvar#vaishnavism "show Āḻvār definitions") grew apprehensive of the safety of the Lord of exquisite charm, moving along in this wicked land alone and unattended. The Āḻvār could, however, regain his composure, shaking off the [fear](/definition/fear#history "show fear definitions") in question, on the assurance given by the Lord, vide VIII-3-10. The following decad revealed an Āḻvār, fully relieved of his erstwhile [fears](/definition/fear#history "show fears definitions"), but the intense mental enjoyment of the Lord’s regal Form, enchanting every inch, resorted to by the Āḻvār in VIII-4-7, once again resulted in a deep yearning, an insatiable longing for external perception of the Lord’s Form, as envisioned by him and getting locked in His sweet embrace. Non-fulfilment of his longing has consigned the Āḻvār to the bottom-most depths of dejection, the like of which has not been witnessed in the earlier decade. He cries out, like unto one bodily trapped in a [forest](/definition/forest#history "show forest definitions") fire and his limbs appear to be even more worn out than their owner. The Saint beckons the Lord to appear before him in all His regal splendour, wearing His crown, tall and majestic and moving along, like the exhilarating rain-[cloud](/definition/cloud#history "show cloud definitions"), the rising Sun, so on and so forth. The Lord did not, however, respond and so, this decad ends on a despondent note, the Āḻvār being led to believe that he would just pass away, immured in grief.
