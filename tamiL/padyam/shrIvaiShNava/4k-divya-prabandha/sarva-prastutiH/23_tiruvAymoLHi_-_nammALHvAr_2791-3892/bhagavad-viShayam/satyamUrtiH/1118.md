**[Tamil](/definition/tamil#history "show Tamil definitions") text and transliteration:**

நீர்மையால் நெஞ்சம் வஞ்சித்துப் புகுந்து என்னை  
ஈர்மைசெய்து என்உயிர்ஆய் என்உயிர் உண்டான்  
சீர்மல்குசோலைத் தென்காட்கரைஎன்அப்பன்  
கார்முகில் வண்ணன்தன் கள்வம் அறிகிலேன்.

nīrmaiyāl neñcam vañcittup pukuntu eṉṉai  
īrmaiceytu eṉuyirāy eṉuyir uṇṭāṉ  
cīrmalkucōlait teṉkāṭkaraieṉappaṉ  
kārmukil vaṇṇaṉtaṉ kaḷvam aṟikilēṉ.

**English translation of verse 9.6.3:**

Methought the Lord got inside me, being my Master,  
So as to sustain me, but what was really the matter?  
Once inside, He caught me unawares and my mind did shatter  
By His simplicity galore, wanting to serve me, His vassal;  
The stealthy ways of the [cloud](/definition/cloud#history "show cloud definitions")-hued Lord, Who does dwell,  
In Teṉkāṭkarai, amid lovely gardens, I can’t tell.

**Notes:**

If only the [Āḻvār](/definition/aḻvar#vaishnavism "show Āḻvār definitions") had a prior knowledge of the Lord’s intention to reverse the normal gear and serve him, His born vassal, he would not have allowed Him access to the interior of his heart. Having gained entry, the Lord displayed His amazing simplicity whereby He made the Āḻvār just melt down and dwindle. Having kindled God-love in the Āḻvār, the Lord just devoured him through His all-conquering love.
