அயர்க்கும் சுற்றும் பற்றி நோக்கி அகலவே நீள் நோக்குக் கொள்ளும்,  
வியர்க்கும் மழைக்கண் துளும்ப வெவ்வுயிர் கொள்ளும் மெய் சோரும்,  
பெயர்த்தும் கண்ணா! என்று பேசும், பெருமானே! வா! என்று கூவும்,  
மயல் பெருங் காதல் என் பேதைக்கு என்செய்கேன் வல்வினையேனே!

ayarkkum cuṟṟum paṟṟi nōkki akalavē nīḷ nōkkuk koḷḷum,  
viyarkkum maḻaikkaṇ tuḷumpa vevvuyir koḷḷum mey cōrum,  
peyarttum [kaṇṇā](/definition/kanna#history "show kaṇṇā definitions")! eṉṟu pēcum, perumāṉē! vā! eṉṟu kūvum,

**English translation of verse 4.4.10:**

Love-mad, my daughter looks around many a time (for Kaṇṇaṉ)  
And then, she looks far across, with eyes wide open,  
[Tears](/definition/tear#history "show Tears definitions") well up her eyes and (disappointed) she sweats and withers down,  
Heaving a deep sigh; even so, Him she fondly beckons,  
‘Kaṇṇā, my Sire,’; what shall this sinner do for her, love-lorn?

**Note**

Unable to get at the Lord in the manner the Nāyakī attempted, namely, running after things bearing His likeness, the Nāyakī, stands dazed. However, in the certain hope that her beloved [Kṛṣṇa](/definition/krishna#vaishnavism "show Kṛṣṇa definitions") will go to her, Parāṅkuśa Nāyakī looks around but not finding Him anywhere near at hand, she fancies, He must be on His way, having already left the celestium, bound for her. And, therefore, she strains her eyes to look at Him, coming down from [Heaven](/definition/heaven#history "show Heaven definitions"), and enjoy His majestic gait. But then, she sweats heavily, with disappointment and tears well up her eyes. Withering down, she breathes hot and yet, she couldn’t resist calling out for Him, at the top of her voice, At this stage, due to the exhilaration of reciting the Lord’s names, she fancies that He has come within sight of her mind’s eye and lovingly welcomes Him, saying, “Come along, my Lord,”
