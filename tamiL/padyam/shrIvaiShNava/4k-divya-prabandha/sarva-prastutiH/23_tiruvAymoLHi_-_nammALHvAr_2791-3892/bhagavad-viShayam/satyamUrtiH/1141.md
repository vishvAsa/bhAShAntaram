In the last decad, the Saint despatched several messengers to the Lord at Tirumūḻikkaḷam and yet, he could hardly contain the effervescence of God-love in him. He could not patiently await the return of the emissaries from the Lord and so, he tried to sustain himself by [meeting](/definition/meeting#history "show meeting definitions") the Lord enshrined in Tirunāvāy (another pilgrim centre in [Kerala](/definition/kerala#history "show Kerala definitions") State, the number of such pilgrim centres in that State adding up to thirteen.) But, in his present state of desolation and debility, he could not make the trip to that pilgrim centre. The next best he could do was, therefore, to meditate on the Lord at Tirunāvāy, right from where he was. This is precisely what he does, in this decad. As Nampiḷḷai puts it, the [Āḻvār](/definition/aḻvar#vaishnavism "show Āḻvār definitions") was now in the same mental state as [Sītā](/definition/sita#vaishnavism "show Sītā definitions") was, during the period intervening [Hanumān](/definition/hanuman#vaishnavism "show Hanumān definitions")’s [visit](/definition/visit#history "show visit definitions") to her in Aśokavana and her eventual restoration to Lord [Rāma](/definition/rama#vaishnavism "show Rāma definitions").
