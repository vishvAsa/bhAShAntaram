வன்சரண் சுரர்க்கு ஆய் அசுரர்க்கு வெம் கூற்றமும் ஆய்  
தன்சரண் நிழற்கீழ் உலகம் வைத்தும் வையாதும்  
தென்சரண் திசைக்குத் திருவிண்ணகர் சேர்ந்த பிரான்  
என்சரண் என் கண்ணன் என்னை ஆளுடை என் அப்பனே

vaṉcaraṇ curarkku āy acurarkku vem kūṟṟamum āy  
taṉcaraṇ niḻaṟkīḻ ulakam vaittum vaiyātum  
teṉcaraṇ ticaikkut tiruviṇṇakar cērnta pirāṉ  
eṉcaraṇ eṉ kaṇṇaṉ eṉṉai āḷuṭai eṉ appaṉē

**English translation of verse 6.3.8:**

In Tiruviṇṇakar, the Refuge of the southerly direction, stays  
Kaṇṇaṉ, my Liege-Lord, my sole Refuge, the [Devas](/definition/deva#vaishnavism "show Devas definitions") haven safe,  
The deadly opponent of the Asuras, Who caresses under His feet  
And shelters the devout and leaves others in [scorching](/definition/scorching#history "show scorching definitions") heat.

#### Notes

\(i\) The Lord is known to be absolutely impartial and yet, whenever the Devas are tormented by the Asuras, the former seek refuge in Him and He engages Himself in a pitched battle against the Asuras and vanquishes them. There is, however, no inconsistency, if looked at in the manner indicated below.

\(ii\) In the [tanks](/definition/tank#history "show tanks definitions") dug by charitable men, one man allays his thirst, while another drowns himself of [death](/definition/death#history "show death definitions"). The [lamp](/definition/lamp#history "show lamp definitions") is there to shed light during nights and make our movements easy. But then, the winged ants rush in and die. The Lord, by Himself, is not overzealous in protecting the Devas or [hell](/definition/hell#history "show hell definitions")-bent to put down the Asuras but none can help the latter category if they court destruction, as in the instances cited here.

\(iii\) Unto those, who seek Him as the Sole Refuge, He grants cool shelter and makes them forgot all their erstwhile miseries. On the other hand, those who stray away from Him and run after the sensual pleasures, like unto trying to quench one’s thirst by [swallowing](/definition/swallowing#history "show swallowing definitions") the blazing flame or reposing under the shade cast by the swinging hood of the Cobra, are left severely alone, to wither away.
