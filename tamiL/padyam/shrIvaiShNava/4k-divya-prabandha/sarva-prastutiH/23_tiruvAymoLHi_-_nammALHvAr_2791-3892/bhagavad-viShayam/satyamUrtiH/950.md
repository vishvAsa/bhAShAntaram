வருவார் செல்வார் வண்பரிசாரத்து இருந்த என்  
திருவாழ்மார்வற்கு என்திறம் சொல்லார் செய்வதுஎன்  
உருவார் சக்கரம் சங்குசுமந்து இங்குஉம்மோடு  
ஒருபாடுஉழல்வான் ஓர்அடியானும் உளன்என்றே.

varuvār celvār vaṇparicārattu irunta eṉ  
tiruvāḻmārvaṟku eṉtiṟam collār ceyvatueṉ  
uruvār cakkaram caṅkucumantu iṅkuummōṭu  
orupāṭuuḻalvāṉ ōraṭiyāṉum uḷaṉeṉṟē.

**English translation of verse 8.3.7:**

Alas! those passing in and out of [Vaṇparicāram](/definition/vanparicaram#vaishnavism "show Vaṇparicāram definitions"), where resides my Lord  
Bearing [Tiru](/definition/tiru#history "show Tiru definitions") ([Lakṣmī](/definition/lakshmi#vaishnavism "show Lakṣmī definitions")) on His winsome chest, tell Him not.  
Here is a vassal ready to get close to Him and roam behind,  
Carrying His discus and conch lovely, keeping one end.

**Notes:**

The [Āḻvār](/definition/aḻvar#vaishnavism "show Āḻvār definitions"), [seated](/definition/seat#history "show seated definitions") inside of the hollow of the sacred tamarind [tree](/definition/tree#history "show tree definitions") in Tirunakari, [pines](/definition/pine#history "show pines definitions") for the service of the Lord in nearby Tiruvaṇparicāram. He fancies that the passersby are all moving to and from Tiruvaṇparicāram, only to tell the Lord over there about him and his ardour to serve Him, looking upon Him as his all (Vāsudevassarvamiti), and bring him back the message from that end. But, unfortunately, none goes near him and he concludes, with a galling sense of disappointment, that none of these persons has functioned in the manner he expected. By offering to keep up one end, the Āḻvār is only [filling](/definition/filling#history "show filling definitions") up a gap, the other end being always kept up by [Lakṣmaṇa](/definition/lakshmana#vaishnavism "show Lakṣmaṇa definitions"), ever in the Lord’s service.
