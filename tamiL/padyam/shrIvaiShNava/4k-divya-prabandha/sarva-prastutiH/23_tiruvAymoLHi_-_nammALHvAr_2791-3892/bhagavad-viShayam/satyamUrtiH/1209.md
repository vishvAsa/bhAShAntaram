வேய்மரு தோள்இணை மெலியும் ஆலோ! மெலிவும்என் தனிமையும் யாதும் நோக்காக்  
காமரு குயில்களும் கூவும் ஆலோ! கணமயில் அவைகலந்து ஆலும் ஆலோ  
ஆமருவுஇன நிரை மேய்க்க நீபோக்கு ஒருபகல் ஆயிரம் ஊழிஆலோ  
தாமரைக் கண்கள்கொண்டு ஈர்தி ஆலோ! தகவிலை தகவிலையே நீ கண்ணா! (2)

**English translation of verse 10.3.1:**

Alas! my bamboo-like arms have thinned down,  
Lean and lonely am I but You take no note of it;  
The pretty koels coo and the [peacocks](/definition/peacock#history "show peacocks definitions") strut about,  
If you’d the cattle follow for grazing and remain  
Away from us a whole day, it looks a thousand aeons,  
Your lotus eyes do our minds attract and oppress,  
Surely, Oh, Kaṇṇā, You shed not your grace on us.

**Notes:**

The Koels coo the love-songs and the peacocks are seen strutting about; [Kṛṣṇa](/definition/krishna#vaishnavism "show Kṛṣṇa definitions") is still in bed, but He is sure to leave shortly for the grazing [fields](/definition/field#history "show fields definitions"), along with the cattle, and the prospect of separation from Him, a little hence, is so dreadful that the [Gopīs](/definition/gopi#vaishnavism "show Gopīs definitions") have already begun to feel the pangs of separation, as if Kṛṣṇa has already left. It is a terrific gloom that has descended on the Gopīs; the arms, that would gladly embrace the Lord, have already lost their vitality and thinned down. They cannot brook separation from Him, even for a trice, which looms like a whole [Yuga](/definition/yuga#vaishnavism "show Yuga definitions"), in their eyes c.f. ‘thṛḍi yugāyate tvāmapaśyathāṃ’ ([Gopikā](/definition/gopika#vaishnavism "show Gopikā definitions") [Gītā](/definition/gita#vaishnavism "show Gītā definitions")). Well, Kṛṣṇa tells them that He is very much by their side and yet, they fancy that He has already left and, after all, He will be back home in the evening. But the day is too long a wait and it looks drawn out, as far as ages. The Lord is by-no-means insensitive to the exuberance of love of His girl-companions, and, overawed by the enormity of their love for Him, He casts His bewitching looks at them, which again [torment](/definition/torment#history "show torment definitions") them in the present context. No wonder then, that, in their present irreconcilable mood, the love-intoxicated damsels dub Kṛṣṇa, as one totally devoid of grace.
