In the eighth decad of this Centum, the [Āḻvār](/definition/aḻvar#vaishnavism "show Āḻvār definitions") exhibited his inordinate longing for communion with the Lord and his great grief, due to the non-realisation of the union longed for, found expression in the following decad. Seeing the Āḻvār, in such dire distress, the Lord spoke to him thus: “Well, your grief apart, mine is indeed greater than yours, inasmuch as I have not, as yet, got at you and the privation is mine; it is only for your sake that I have come down, all the way, from the High [Heavens](/definition/heaven#history "show Heavens definitions") to the holy centre of Tirukkaṇṇapuram, near at hand. Surely, I will grant you your desire, at the end of the current span of [life](/definition/life#history "show life definitions")”, Thus placated, the Āḻvār gives vent to his joy, in this decad. The fifth song of this decad is the topical one, stressing the fact that the Lord is the great Benefactor, the granter of [Mokṣa](/definition/moksha#vaishnavism "show Mokṣa definitions") (eternal emancipation) when the body falls off, at the end of the current span of life.

Once again, the Saint, with his characteristic compassion for the sorrowing mankind, sunk deep down the ocean of ‘[Saṃsāra](/definition/samsara#history "show Saṃsāra definitions") addresses them all. He preaches unto them, the path of loving surrender to the Lord who is easily accessible to one and all, at the holy Tirukkaṇṇapuram, bent upon retrieving the votaries. Even if they cannot perform the physical act of prostration at the feet of the Lord, with unflinching faith, surrender unto Him calls for, the mere mention of the name of that holy centre, Tirukkaṇṇapuram will deliver the goods (vide tenth song of this decad).
