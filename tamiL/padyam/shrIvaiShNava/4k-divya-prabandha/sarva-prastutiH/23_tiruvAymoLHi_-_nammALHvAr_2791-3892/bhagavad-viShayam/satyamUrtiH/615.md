என் நான் செய்கேன்! யாரே களைகண்? என்னை என் செய்கின்றாய்?  
உன்னால் அல்லால் யாவராலும் ஒன்றும் குறை வேண்டேன்  
கன் ஆர் மதிள் சூழ் குடந்தைக் கிடந்தாய்! அடியேன் அரு வாழ்நாள்  
செல் நாள் எந் நாள்? அந்நாள் உன தாள் பிடித்தே செலக்காணே

eṉ nāṉ ceykēṉ! yārē kaḷaikaṇ? eṉṉai eṉ ceykiṉṟāy?  
uṉṉāl allāl yāvarālum oṉṟum kuṟai vēṇṭēṉ  
kaṉ ār matiḷ cūḻ kuṭantaik kiṭantāy! aṭiyēṉ aru vāḻnāḷ  
cel nāḷ en nāḷ? annāḷ uṉa tāḷ piṭittē celakkāṇē

**English translation of verse 5.8.3:**

Oh, Lord, reposing in [Kuṭantai](/definition/kutantai#vaishnavism "show Kuṭantai definitions") with parapet [walls](/definition/wall#history "show walls definitions") artistic,  
What can I do and who shall my protector be?  
What indeed do You propose to do with me?  
Means other than You 1 crave not; pray let me stick  
Unto Your feet during the days this vassal is still to eke.

#### Note

Finding the Lord unmoved by his ardent entreaties, the [Āḻvār](/definition/aḻvar#vaishnavism "show Āḻvār definitions") apprehends that the Lord expects him to fall back on other means and, therefore, puts the Lord the triple questions spelt out in [lines](/definition/line#history "show lines definitions") 2 and 3 of this stanza. In essence, the Āḻvār asks the Lord whether He expects him to fend for himself or run after some one else seeking protection, or He would do the job Himself. Side by side, he has also clarified his position beyond any manner of [doubt](/definition/doubt#history "show doubt definitions"), namely, he has no other means but the Lord Himself. The Āḻvār’s stand has been discussed threadbare in aphorism 46 of Śrīvacana [Bhūṣaṇa](/definition/bhushana#vaishnavism "show Bhūṣaṇa definitions") against this particular background. It is reproduced below:

No doubt, the Lord had endowed the Āḻvār with supreme knowledge and yet, it was that very knowledge that stood in the way of his adopting any other means for attaining Him, as it would come into conflict with his essential [nature](/definition/nature#history "show nature definitions") as the Lord’s vassal, solely dependent on Him. Even if he could overlook this basic objection and pursue other paths of discipline, the knowledge bestowed on him by the Supreme Lord was saturated with God-love ([Bhakti](/definition/bhakti#vaishnavism "show Bhakti definitions"))—intellectual love of God. It is this God-love that threw the Āḻvār into a state of ecstasy, precluding recourse to any means other than the Lord Himself, which would demand steady and constant physical and mental exercise
