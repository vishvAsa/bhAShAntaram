எனக்கு நல்அரணை எனதுஆருயிரை இமையவர் தந்தைதாய் தன்னை  
தனக்கும் தன் தன்மை அறிவரியானை தடம்கடல்பள்ளி அம்மானை  
மனக்கொள்சீர் மூவாயிரவர் வண்சிவனும் அயனும்தானும் ஒப்பார்வாழ்  
கனக்கொள் திண்மாடத் திருச்செங்குன்றூரில் திருச்சிற்றாறு அதனுள்கண்டேனே.

**English translation of verse 8.4.6:**

My haven safe, my sole Sustainer, the All-in-one unto Celestials,  
He, who can’t gauge His own disposition (unfathomable),  
He, who does on the ocean vast repose, I could envision  
In Tirucceṅkuṉṟūṟ Tirucciṟṟāṟu, abounding in solid mansions  
And [Brahmins](/definition/brahmin#history "show Brahmins definitions") numbering three thousand, potent like the mighty Civaṉ,  
And Ayaṉ, in whose whose hearts the Lord stands enshrined.

**Notes:**

\(i\) It may be recalled that, as already mentioned in the preamble to this decad, the Lord pacified the [Āḻvār](/definition/aḻvar#vaishnavism "show Āḻvār definitions") and disarmed him of his [fears](/definition/fear#history "show fears definitions"), by pointing out to him this very setting. The Lord is safe and sound in this pilgrim centre, surrounded by three thousand brahmins who are as potent as [Brahmā](/definition/brahma#vaishnavism "show Brahmā definitions") and [Śivā](/definition/shiva#vaishnavism "show Śivā definitions") and could as well discharge the functions assigned by the Lord to those exalted functionaries, c.f. [Śloka](/definition/sloka#vaishnavism "show Śloka definitions") 20 of [Āḷavantār](/definition/alavantar#vaishnavism "show Āḷavantār definitions")’s Stotra [Ratna](/definition/ratna#history "show Ratna definitions")—

> “tvadāśritānaam jagadudbhavasthiti, praṇāsa > [saṃsāra](/definition/samsara#history "show saṃsāra definitions") > vimocanadayaḥ bhavanti leela,”

Which means:

> “The creation, preservation and dissolution of the universe, release > from [family](/definition/family#history "show family definitions") > [bondage](/definition/bondage#history "show bondage definitions") > etc., constitute the sporting activities of Your devotees themselves”.

\(ii\) These Brahmins, immersed in devout contemplation of the Lord’s numerous auspicious traits, are ever alert to the impending danger, studiously safeguarding the Deity of their hearts. They are on a par with Sage [Bharadvāja](/definition/bharadvaja#history "show Bharadvāja definitions"), who was apprehensive of the safety of [Śrī Rāma](/definition/shrirama#history "show Śrī Rāma definitions") and [party](/definition/party#history "show party definitions") in exile, during the interval between their first [meeting](/definition/meeting#history "show meeting definitions") with him and their subsequent return after vanquishing [Rāvaṇa](/definition/ravana#vaishnavism "show Rāvaṇa definitions").
