**[Tamil](/definition/tamil#history "show Tamil definitions") text and transliteration:**

அமுதம் அமரர்கட்கு ஈந்த நிமிர் சுடர் ஆழி நெடுமால்  
அமுதிலும் ஆற்ற இனியன் நிமிர் திரை நீள் கடலானே.

amutam amararkaṭku īnta nimir cuṭar āḻi neṭumāl  
amutilum āṟṟa iṉiyaṉ nimir [tirai](/definition/tirai#history "show tirai definitions") nīḷ kaṭalāṉē.

**English translation of verse 1.6.6:**

Of limitless glory, Neṭumāl, holding the discus  
Of mounting radiance and reclining on the spacious  
Milk-Ocean of surging waves, is more appetising indeed  
Than the ambrosia which unto Amarars ([Devas](/definition/deva#vaishnavism "show Devas definitions")) He once delivered.

**Note**

The [Āḻvār](/definition/aḻvar#vaishnavism "show Āḻvār definitions") has nothing but contemptuous pity for the Devas who sought the ‘amṛt’ obtained by churning the Milk-Ocean, instead of the far more delicious Lord holding the effulgent discus, enchanting beyond words. Although the Āḻvār’s contempt for the Devas is not explicit from the text of the song, the episode of delivering the “amṛt” to the Devas, referred to, in the first [line](/definition/line#history "show line definitions") of the song, pales into insignificance before the Lord’s own nectarean presence and exquisite charm enjoyed by the Āḻvār in the second line of the song and thus indirectly exhibits the Devas at a disadvantage. The Āḻvār has given yet another name to the Lord, namely, ‘*One who is more appetising than ambrosia* [Nampi](/definition/nampi#history "show Nampi definitions") Tiruvaḻutināṭu Tācar remarked that the Devas were no better than the bovine [species](/definition/species#history "show species definitions"), not looking up and beholding the exquisite charm of the Lord churning and moving around with His thousand sinewy shoulders and the beautiful garlands adorning them. Instead, they were gazing at the ocean, with their heads bent down, content with a mere extract from the salt-water, what a pity!
