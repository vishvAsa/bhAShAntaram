**English translation of verse 1.1.1:**

My mind, lift yourself up to the dazzling, *distress-dispelling* feet of the One, who is the Lord of the ever alert *Eternal Heroes*, who is the natural repository of super-excellent traits which cut out all fatigue, and who unto me vouchsafed *wisdom-love*, ridding me of *ignorance*, leaving no trace of it behind.

**Notes**

\(i\) *Distress-dispelling feet*: Tradition has it that this has a pointed reference to the comely feet of Lord [Devarāja](/definition/devaraja#vaishnavism "show Devarāja definitions"), enshrined in Śrī [Hasti](/definition/hastin#history "show Hasti definitions") Śailam ([Kāñcīpuram](/definition/kancipura#vaishnavism "show Kāñcīpuram definitions")). Whereas all the other [Ācāryas](/definition/acarya#vaishnavism "show Ācāryas definitions") before Śrī Rāmānuja interpreted this phrase as “The feet that relieve the distress of the yearning votaries”, Śrī Rāmānuja held that the Lord’s feet relieve His own erstwhile distress over the sad plight of His subjects, sunk deep in the miserable mire of ‘[Saṃsāra](/definition/samsara#history "show Saṃsāra definitions")’, the dreadful cycle of [birth](/definition/birth#history "show birth definitions") and [death](/definition/death#history "show death definitions"), after relieving the distress of the latter.

\(ii\) *Eternal Heroes*: The ‘[Nitya](/definition/nitya#vaishnavism "show Nitya definitions") [Sūrīs](/definition/suri#history "show Sūrīs definitions")’, [Ananta](/definition/ananta#vaishnavism "show Ananta definitions"), [Garuḍa](/definition/garuda#vaishnavism "show Garuḍa definitions"), [Viṣvaksena](/definition/vishvaksena#vaishnavism "show Viṣvaksena definitions") and other celestials, ever alert in the Lord’s intimate service in Yonder [Heavens](/definition/heaven#history "show Heavens definitions"), and ever free, in the sense that they never passed through the gruelling mill of ‘Saṃsāra’ the cycle of birth and death.

\(iii\) ‘*Matinalam*’ in the original text means ‘wisdom-love’ which can be expanded as follows:

> (*a*) God granted me ‘wisdom’ as well as ‘love’.[^1] >
> (*b*) The second interpretation ascribed to Śrī > [Parāśara](/definition/parashara#history "show Parāśara definitions") > Bhaṭṭar is: “God gave me loving wisdom or wisdom partaking of the > [nature](/definition/nature#history "show nature definitions") of love > to God, vigorous from the very root like the ‘*Karuṅkāli*’ (a heavy > wood—*Acasia catechu*). Whereas, in the case of others, love of God is > a growth from acts of virtue, in the case of the > [Āḻvārs](/definition/aḻvar#vaishnavism "show Āḻvārs definitions"), > such love was induced in them by God’s spontaneous grace, and love to > God, in this context, is none other than the heart and mind, perfectly > blended and attuned to the loving service of God. >
> (*c*) Queried whether > [Nammāḻvār](/definition/nammaḻvar#vaishnavism "show Nammāḻvār definitions") > was one characterised by love to God > ([bhakti](/definition/bhakti#vaishnavism "show bhakti definitions")) > or characterised by surrender to the will of God (prapatti), the great > preceptor, Empār, replied that the saint had surrendered his will > entirely to God and that love to God, in his case, was merely a habit > by which he sustained himself, very different from the generality of > us, who, while ostensibly resigned to His will, seek employment, too, > for obtaining > [food](/definition/food#history "show food definitions"), etc. In the > Saint’s case, Lord > [Kṛṣṇa](/definition/krishna#vaishnavism "show Kṛṣṇa definitions") was > unto him everything—food, drink and every other luxury.

[^1]:  Bhakti rūpāpanna Jñāna or intellectual love of God.

\(iv\) *Rid of ignorance*: Clear-cut knowledge, absolutely free from non-apprehensicn (*ajñāna*) or the error of mistaking the body for the soul, wrong apprehension (*[anyatha](/definition/anyatha#history "show anyatha definitions")-[jñāna](/definition/jnana#vaishnavism "show jñāna definitions")*) or the error of owing allegiance to other than the Supreme Lord (minor deities) and ‘*viparita-jñāna*’ (mis-apprehension or inverted apprehension), the error of thinking that the individual soul is the independent master and can enjoy itself (like the *[kaivalya](/definition/kaivalya#vaishnavism "show kaivalya definitions")* class) whereas it is the sole servitor of the Lord, in whom vests the inviolable right to enjoy the former—such blemishless knowledge was dowered on the saint by the Lord’s free Grace—an act of Grace galore!
