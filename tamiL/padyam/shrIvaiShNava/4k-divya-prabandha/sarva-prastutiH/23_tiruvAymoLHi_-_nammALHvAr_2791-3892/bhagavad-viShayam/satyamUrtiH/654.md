**[Tamil](/definition/tamil#history "show Tamil definitions") text and transliteration:**

வைகல் பூங் கழிவாய் வந்து மேயும் குருகினங்காள்  
செய் கொள் செந்நெல் உயர் திருவண்வண்டூர் உறையும்  
கை கொள் சக்கரத்து என் கனிவாய்ப் பெருமானைக் கண்டு  
கைகள் கூப்பி சொல்லீர் வினையாட்டியேன் காதன்மையே. (2)

vaikal pūṅ kaḻivāy vantu mēyum kurukiṉaṅkāḷ  
cey koḷ cennel uyar tiruvaṇvaṇṭūr uṟaiyum  
kai koḷ cakkarattu eṉ kaṉivāyp perumāṉaik kaṇṭu  
kaikaḷ kūppi collīr viṉaiyāṭṭiyēṉ kātaṉmaiyē. (2)

**English translation of verse 6.1.1:**

Ye herds of Heron, always seeking [food](/definition/food#history "show food definitions") in water-logged land!  
Go unto my Lord with fruit like lips and discus in hand.  
Who does for ever in Tiruvaṇvaṇṭūr reside,  
Where there are plenty of [rich](/definition/rich#history "show rich definitions") [paddy](/definition/paddy#history "show paddy definitions") [fields](/definition/field#history "show fields definitions");  
And convey the depth of this sinner’s love, with your hands, folded.

#### Notes

\(i\) The Nāyakī describes the place to which the herons have to go and the hard hearted Lord to whom they have to report her unique love, emanating from a tender heart. The description of the destination should indeed tempt the [birds](/definition/bird#history "show birds definitions"), for there too, they can have plenty of food. Hard-hearted though He might be, the Nāyakī cannot lift her mind from His fascinating lips and that too, on the heels of her enjoyment of Kṛṣṇāvatāra, in the immediately preceding decad.

\(ii\) The inner meaning of this song, as brought out in aphorism 154 of ‘[Ācārya](/definition/acarya#vaishnavism "show Ācārya definitions") Hṛdayaṃ!’ is given below:

An Ācārya (Preceptor) of spotless [purity](/definition/purity#history "show purity definitions") in and out, who revels in God-enjoyment in the [company](/definition/company#history "show company definitions") of his inseparable disciples and attends pious [gatherings](/definition/gathering#history "show gatherings definitions") along with them, is being sought out, as an efficient [medium](/definition/medium#history "show medium definitions") for securing communion with the Lord.

\(iii\) The [Āḻvār](/definition/aḻvar#vaishnavism "show Āḻvār definitions"), who had tasted the Lord’s condescending love and amazing simplicity during those blissful moments of union with Him, is now inclined to disdain Him for His aloofness, the predominant trait of His transcendent (Paratva) aspect. This is reflected in her warning to the birds to approach the Lord with folded hands, with due regard to His might and majesty.
