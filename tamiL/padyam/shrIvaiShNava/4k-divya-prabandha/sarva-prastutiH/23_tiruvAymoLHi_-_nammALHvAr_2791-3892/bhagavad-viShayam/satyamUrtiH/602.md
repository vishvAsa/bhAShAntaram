கருளப் புள் கொடி சக்கரப் படை வான நாட! என் கார்முகில் வண்ணா  
பொருள் அல்லாத என்னைப் பொருளாக்கி அடிமைகொண்டாய்  
தெருள் கொள் நான்மறை வல்லவர் பலர்வாழ் சிரீவரமங்கலநகர்க்கு  
அருள்செய்து அங்கு இருந்தாய்! அறியேன் ஒரு கைம்மாறே

**English translation of verse 5.7.3:**

Oh, Lord of [Heaven](/definition/heaven#history "show Heaven definitions"), on Your banner is Karuḷaṉ and in Your hand  
Is the discus valiant, my [cloud](/definition/cloud#history "show cloud definitions")-hued Lord, mere chaff was I  
And yet, You Who gracefully reside in Cirīvaramaṅkai,  
Full of [Vedic](/definition/veda#vaishnavism "show Vedic definitions") scholars of knowledge chaste, have turned  
This dud into Your vassal [hymning Your glory great]  
I know not how to recompense You, my Benefactor great.

#### Note

In between the preceding stanza and this one, there would appear to have ensued a scintillating dialogue between the Lord and the [Āḻvār](/definition/aḻvar#vaishnavism "show Āḻvār definitions"). Put briefly, the Āḻvār who prayed in the last song for the bestowal on Him of the Lord’s grace, gets pulled up by Him, saying that there should be due merit in him deserving of His grace. The Āḻvār is quick to put the ball back into the Lord’s court, by pointing out that He had already enlisted him. a mere dud with no equipment whatever, in His service. Had it not been for His grace galore, the Āḻvār wouldn't be able to render the glorious service (vācika kaiṅkarya) of [singing](/definition/singing#history "show singing definitions") the [Tiruvāymoḻi](/definition/tiruvaymoli#vaishnavism "show Tiruvāymoḻi definitions"), songs, *par excellence*. And so, the Āḻvār prays unto the Lord to go on bestowing His spontaneous grace on him as before, without looking for any merit (Means) in him; in fact, he has none whatsoever, comparable to the end in view, and what little merit there is in him already, has also been implanted by Him only. Oh, how gracious is the Supreme Lord of Heaven, obliging the pious and scholarly residents of [Vāṉamāmalai](/definition/vanamamalai#vaishnavism "show Vāṉamāmalai definitions") with His nectarean presence, in the same way He does unto the denizens of Heaven and how indeed can the Āḻvār recompense Him for His Grace galore!
