**[Tamil](/definition/tamil#history "show Tamil definitions") text and transliteration:**

இறந்ததும் நீயே எதிர்ந்ததும் நீயே நிகழ்வதோ நீ இன்னேஆனால்  
சிறந்தநின் தன்மை அதுஇதுஉதுஎன்று அறிவுஒன்றும் சங்கிப்பன்வினையேன்  
கறந்தபால் நெய்யே நெய்யின் சுவையே! கடலினுள் அமுதமே அமுதில்  
பிறந்த இன்சுவையே சுவையதுபயனே! பின்னைதோள் மணந்தபேர்ஆயா!

iṟantatum nīyē etirntatum nīyē nikaḻvatō nī iṉṉēāṉāl  
ciṟantaniṉ taṉmai atuituutueṉṟu aṟivuoṉṟum caṅkippaṉviṉaiyēṉ  
kaṟantapāl neyyē neyyiṉ cuvaiyē! kaṭaliṉuḷ amutamē amutil  
piṟanta iṉcuvaiyē cuvaiyatupayaṉē! piṉṉaitōḷ maṇantapērāyā!

**English translation of verse 8.1.7:**

Sweet as milk fresh-drawn and the ghee that from it ensues,  
You are, my Lord, the very sweetness in ghee, the ambrosia.  
That from the ocean emerged, with its sweet contents,  
The joy that from such sweetness results; the charming Piṉṉai  
You did wed, oh, [Gopal](/definition/gopal#vaishnavism "show Gopal definitions"), the past, the future and the present  
You do control; this sinner is losing faith in You, even then,  
As the Lord Supreme of all things, near, far and in between.

**Notes:**

The [Āḻvār](/definition/aḻvar#vaishnavism "show Āḻvār definitions") says that the knowledge of the Lord being the Supreme Controller of all things and beings, abiding in all, which sustained him hitherto, is forsaking him now, the sinner that he is. Time, with its triple components of ‘Past’, ‘Present’ and ‘Future’ and all things and beings embraced within its folds, are but the Lord’s modes. The Āḻvār could, therefore, discern the hand of the Lord, in all happenings, at all times. The Lord is the quintessence of all that is delicious, the inner core of sweetness. This sweetness gets heightened manifold, when the Lord is in conjunction with His Divine Consort. The Āḻvār can, therefore, hardly subsist without partaking of such unalloyed and unlimited bliss and yet, in his present state of separation from Him, he is even led to suspect whether all this glory, attributed to the Lord, is at all real or a mere figment of imagination. The [doubt](/definition/doubt#history "show doubt definitions") expressed by the Āḻvār earlier in this decad, was about the Lord’s capacity to redeem His subjects. There at least, the Lord could escape by putting the blame on the supplicant’s inadequacy, failings etc. But here, the Āḻvār is led to suspect even the basic feature of the Lord, as the all-pervading, inner Controller of all things and beings, said to be but His modes or attributes.
