**[Tamil](/definition/tamil#history "show Tamil definitions") text and transliteration:**

வாரிக்கொண்டு உன்னைவிழுங்குவன் காணில்' என்று  
ஆர்வுஉற்ற என்னை ஒழிய என்னில் முன்னம்  
பாரித்துத் தான்என்னை முற்றப் பருகினான்  
கார்ஒக்கும் காட்கரைஅப்பன் கடியனே.

vārikkoṇṭu uṉṉaiviḻuṅkuvaṉ kāṇil' eṉṟu  
ārvuuṟṟa eṉṉai oḻiya eṉṉil muṉṉam  
pārittut tāṉeṉṉai muṟṟap parukiṉāṉ  
kārokkum kāṭkaraiappaṉ kaṭiyaṉē.

**English translation of verse 9.6.10:**

Eager I was indeed to gather the Lord up and devour  
If Him I could only behold but my [cloud](/definition/cloud#history "show cloud definitions")-hued Sire,  
Ever alert, Who in [Kāṭkarai](/definition/katkarai#vaishnavism "show Kāṭkarai definitions") has taken abode,  
Did consume me, in full, going we'l ahead.

**Notes:**

It can be firmly asserted that this song is indeed the very cream of the entire hymnal, yielding, as it does, the grand thesis that attainment of the individual soul is the Lord’s great gain. This incidentally sets at naught the oft-debated concept of the individual gaining the Lord and striving to that end. In the ‘Song Celestial’, Lord [Kṛṣṇa](/definition/krishna#vaishnavism "show Kṛṣṇa definitions") said, in a tone of frustration, that the Saint who looked upon Him, as All-in-one, the great Redeemer and Sole Sustainer, was scarce indeed. The Lord was looking for one such but couldn’t get hold of any. Barely six weeks after He went to the Celestium. [Nammāḻvār](/definition/nammalvar#vaishnavism "show Nammāḻvār definitions"), answering to this description, came into this world. The [Āḻvār](/definition/aḻvar#vaishnavism "show Āḻvār definitions") was consumed by God-love, too deep for words. But the Lord forestalled him, being ever alert and consumed him with His all-conquering love, proving more than a match for the Āḻvār. The Lord had indeed made herculean efforts to reclaim the Āḻvār and little wonder then, that He literally pounced upon him, after having kindled in him God-love of such great magnitude.
