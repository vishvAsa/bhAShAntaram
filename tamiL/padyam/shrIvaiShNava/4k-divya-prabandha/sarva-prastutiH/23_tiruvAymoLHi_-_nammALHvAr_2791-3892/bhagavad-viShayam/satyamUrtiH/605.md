ஏனம் ஆய் நிலம் கீண்ட என் அப்பனே! கண்ணா! என்றும் என்னை ஆளுடை  
வான நாயகனே! மணி மாணிக்கச்சுடரே  
தேன மாம்பொழில் தண் சிரீவரமங்கலத்தவர் கைதொழ உறை  
வானமாமலையே! அடியேன் தொழ வந்தருளே. (2)

**English translation of verse 5.7.6:**

Oh, Lord [Vāṉamāmalai](/definition/vanamamalai#vaishnavism "show Vāṉamāmalai definitions"), reside you do in cool Cirīvaramaṅkai,  
Surrounded by mango-orchards with honey in plenty,  
And adored by its residents; as the [Boar](/definition/boar#history "show Boar definitions") huge You pulled  
The Earth out and put it back in its place, my Lord,  
Me you have enlisted as Your vassal, oh Lord of [heaven](/definition/heaven#history "show heaven definitions"),  
Radiant like gem and [ruby](/definition/ruby#history "show ruby definitions"), oh, Kaṇṇā, Pray come down  
Unto me here that this vassal may also offer Thee salutation.

#### Notes

\(i\) ‘Vāṉamāmalai’ is alike the name of the Deity and the Pilgrim centre. It means, ‘mountain, sky-high’; so very imposing is the Lord’s Image there indeed and this description fits in admirably.

\(ii\) The Lord’s incarnations are referred to by the [Āḻvār](/definition/aḻvar#vaishnavism "show Āḻvār definitions"), only to remind the Lord of the basic idea, namely, the elevation of the souls down below. ‘[Avatāra](/definition/avatara#vaishnavism "show Avatāra definitions")’ means descent and He comes down to push up the subjects, working like a pulley system. The resuscitation of the Earth from under the waters of the [Deluge](/definition/deluge#history "show Deluge definitions"), the Lord assuming the form of a Boar for this purpose, is specially mentioned by the Āḻvār to remind the Lord that he should also be similarly rescued from the bottomless ocean of [Saṃsāra](/definition/samsara#history "show Saṃsāra definitions") (worldly [life](/definition/life#history "show life definitions")).

\(iii\) The Lord is required to walk down to the Āḻvār’s place, for the latter to enjoy His glorious gait.
