**[Tamil](/definition/tamil#history "show Tamil definitions") text and transliteration:**

நன்குஎண்ணி நான்வளர்த்த சிறுகிளிப்பைதலே  
இன்குரல் நீ மிழற்றேல் என்ஆர்உயிர்க் காகுத்தன்  
நின்செய்ய வாய்ஒக்கும் வாயன் கண்ணன்கை காலினன்  
நின்பசும்சாம நிறத்தன் கூட்டுண்டு நீங்கினான்.

naṉkueṇṇi nāṉvaḷartta ciṟukiḷippaitalē  
iṉkural nī miḻaṟṟēl eṉāruyirk kākuttaṉ  
niṉceyya vāyokkum vāyaṉ kaṇṇaṉkai kāliṉaṉ  
niṉpacumcāma niṟattaṉ kūṭṭuṇṭu nīṅkiṉāṉ.

**English translation of verse 9.5.6:**

Methought you would unto my aid come in times of need.  
And so, my tiny little [parrot](/definition/parrot#history "show parrot definitions"), You I did lovingly tend;  
Sing no more, in my presence, in your tone sweet and remind  
Me of Kākuttaṉ, dear as [life](/definition/life#history "show life definitions"), of a complexion like yours,  
Whose lips are like unto your beak red, whose eyes,  
Hands and feet resemble yours, who was in my embrace locked  
But has now from me fled, oh, how wicked!

**Notes:**

The young parrot, lovingly tended by the Nāyakī and taught by her to spell out the Lord’s names, prattles the Lord’s names in the Nāyakī’s hearing. Poor little thing, it does not know that it hardly suits her, in her present state of mental agony due to her separation from the Lord. Actually, the Lord’s names, mouthed by the faithful parrot, just pierce the Nāyakī, like sharp spears, as Nampiḷḷai would put it. The Nāyakī chicks the parrot for inflicting such agony on her, like unto the young one attempting to kill the mother. It would, of course, be a different story altogether if the parrot performed likewise when the saint is in the blessed state of communion with the Lord.
