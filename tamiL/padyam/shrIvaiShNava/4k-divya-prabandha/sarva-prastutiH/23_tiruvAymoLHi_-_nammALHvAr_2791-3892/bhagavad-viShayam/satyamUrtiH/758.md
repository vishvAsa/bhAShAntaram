**[Tamil](/definition/tamil#history "show Tamil definitions") text and transliteration:**

நீராய் நிலனாய் தீயாய் காலாய் நெடுவானாய்,  
சீரார் சுடர்கள் இரண்டாய் சிவனாய் அயனானாய்,  
கூரார் ஆழி வெண்சங்கு ஏந்தி கொடியேன்பால்  
வாராய், ஒருநாள் மண்ணும் விண்ணும் மகிழவே.

nīrāy nilaṉāy tīyāy kālāy neṭuvāṉāy,  
cīrār cuṭarkaḷ iraṇṭāy civaṉāy ayaṉāṉāy,  
kūrār āḻi veṇcaṅku ēnti koṭiyēṉpāl  
vārāy, orunāḷ maṇṇum viṇṇum makiḻavē.

**English translation of verse 6.9.1:**

Oh, Lord, You pervade the elements, one and all,  
The Sun, the Moon, Civaṉ and Ayaṉ, as Internal Controller of them all;  
Please appear before this sinner, for a day at least, holding the discus sharp  
And the white conch so that [Heaven](/definition/heaven#history "show Heaven definitions") and Earth do rejoice.

**Note**

The [Āḻvār](/definition/aḻvar#vaishnavism "show Āḻvār definitions") could certainly cognise the Universal Form of the Lord, in the created world of multifarious things and creatures, even as [Prahlāda](/definition/prahlada#vaishnavism "show Prahlāda definitions") did. There was obviously no need, in that case, for him to send emissaries to the Lord, here and there, as he has been doing. And now, the Āḻvār clarifies his stand; he [pines](/definition/pine#history "show pines definitions") for the Lord’s extraordinary Form of exquisite charm, wielding the sharp discus and the white conch, the Lord’s ‘[Divya](/definition/divya#vaishnavism "show Divya definitions") [maṅgala](/definition/mangala#history "show maṅgala definitions") vigraha’, the Supernal Form. It is for beholding this enthralling Form of the Lord, even if it be but once, that the Āḻvār is [pouring](/definition/pouring#history "show pouring definitions") out his heart. Did not [Arjuna](/definition/arjuna#vaishnavism "show Arjuna definitions") insist, after beholding the Lord’s [Viśvarūpa](/definition/vishvarupa#vaishnavism "show Viśvarūpa definitions")’ (the breath taking Cosmic Form of formidable dimensions) that He be seen as the lovely [Kṛṣṇa](/definition/krishna#vaishnavism "show Kṛṣṇa definitions"), as before, with just four arms, as against the thousands shown to him?
