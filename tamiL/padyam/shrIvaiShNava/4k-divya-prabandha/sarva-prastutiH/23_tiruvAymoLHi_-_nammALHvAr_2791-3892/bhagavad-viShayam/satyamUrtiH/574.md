**[Tamil](/definition/tamil#history "show Tamil definitions") text and transliteration:**

ஊர் எல்லாம் துஞ்சி உலகு எல்லாம் நள் இருள் ஆய்  
நீர் எல்லாம் தேறி ஓர் நீள் இரவு ஆய் நீண்டதால்  
பார் எல்லாம் உண்ட நம் பாம்பு அணையான் வாரானால்  
ஆர் எல்லே! வல்வினையேன் ஆவி காப்பார் இனியே? (2)

ūr ellām tuñci ulaku ellām naḷ iruḷ āy  
nīr ellām tēṟi ōr nīḷ [iravu](/definition/iravu#history "show iravu definitions") āy nīṇṭatāl  
pār ellām uṇṭa nam pāmpu aṇaiyāṉ vārāṉāl  
ār ellē! valviṉaiyēṉ āvi kāppār iṉiyē? (2)

**English translation of verse 5.4.1:**

The town is asleep and the world in darkness plunged,  
Very, very quiet, the land and water have become;  
Alas! ‘tis one long night, the Lord on [serpent](/definition/serpent#history "show serpent definitions")-bed.  
Who once ate up the worlds, unto me doesn’t come;  
Who will save the [life](/definition/life#history "show life definitions") of this terrible sinner indeed?

**Note**

The Nāyakī laments that the benevolent Lord, who sustained all the worlds with their contents, in His stomach and protected them during the [deluge](/definition/deluge#history "show deluge definitions"), does not come to her aid in her present state of distress. The slanderous folks whose gossips actually fostered her God-love are fast asleep and so is the rest of the world. The Nāyakī cannot move about either because it is one long night, even longer than the longish[^1] nights of the Devas and visibility is next to nil. Further, there is none awake except her lone self.

[^1]:  Whereas ‘Time’ stands still in the self-luminous region, known as the ‘High Heaven ', and it is all day and no night (darkness-tamas), the day of the ‘Devas’ in the lower reaches of the upper worlds is as long as one year of ours, six months (mid-January to mid-July-Uttarāyana) constituting a day for them and the remaining six months (mid-July to mid-January—Dakṣiṇāyana) their night.
