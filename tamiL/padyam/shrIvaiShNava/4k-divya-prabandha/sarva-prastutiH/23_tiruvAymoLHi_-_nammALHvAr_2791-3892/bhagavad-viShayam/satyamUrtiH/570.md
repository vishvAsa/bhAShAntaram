**[Tamil](/definition/tamil#history "show Tamil definitions") text and transliteration:**

யாம் மடல் ஊர்ந்தும் எம் ஆழி அங்கைப் பிரான் உடை  
தூ மடல் தண் அம் துழாய் மலர் கொண்டு சூடுவோம்  
ஆம் மடம் இன்றி தெருவுதோறு அயல் தையலார்  
நா மடங்காப் பழி தூற்றி நாடும் இரைக்கவே.

yām maṭal ūrntum em āḻi aṅkaip pirāṉ uṭai  
tū maṭal taṇ am tuḻāy malar koṇṭu cūṭuvōm  
ām maṭam iṉṟi teruvutōṟu ayal taiyalār  
nā maṭaṅkāp [paḻi](/definition/pali#history "show paḻi definitions") tūṟṟi nāṭum iraikkavē.

**English translation of verse 5.3.10:**

Shaking off all reserve, [street](/definition/street#history "show street definitions") after street shall I enter  
And make women in all the worlds shout beside me and clamour,  
In sheer sympathy for me, having recourse to *maṭal*,  
And from the Lord, wielding the discus lovely, procure  
And wear the tuḷaci garland, cool and lovely, with petals pure.

#### Note

If the Nāyakī contemplates such a drastic move, totally repugnant to her essential [nature](/definition/nature#history "show nature definitions"), it is because of the exuberance of her God-love and the resultant intolerance of delayed consummation. This aspect has already been dealt with, *in extenso*, in the preamble to this decad. At the end of all these hectic activities, all that the Nāyakī aspires for is the Lord’s tuḷaci garland, that sacred basil. The Nāyakī still hopes that, frightened by this harrowing state of her darting forth, with ‘*Maṭal*’ (the tooth-edged branch of the palmy-rah [tree](/definition/tree#history "show tree definitions")) in hand, the Lord would rush forward, with discus in hand, and placate her by bedecking her with the tuḷaci garland worn on His person; if, however, He did not turn up, it would mean, she threatens, the end of them both as in a holocaust.
