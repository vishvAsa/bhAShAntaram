**[Tamil](/definition/tamil#history "show Tamil definitions") text and transliteration:**

அணங்கு என ஆடும் என் அங்கம் வணங்கி வழிபடும் ஈசன்  
பிணங்கி அமரர் பிதற்றும் குணங்கெழு கொள்கையினானே

aṇaṅku eṉa āṭum eṉ aṅkam vaṇaṅki vaḻipaṭum īcaṉ  
piṇaṅki amarar pitaṟṟum kuṇaṅkeḻu koḷkaiyiṉāṉē

**English translation of verse 1.6.4:**

Īcaṉ (the Lord) I venerate, [dancing](/definition/dancing#history "show dancing definitions") in gay abandon,  
Is the natural repository of many an auspicious trait,  
Leaving the celestials in the high [Heaven](/definition/heaven#history "show Heaven definitions"),  
Entranced and engaged in endless debate.

**Note**

As the Lord said in [Bhagavad-Gītā](/definition/bhagavad-gita#vaishnavism "show Bhagavad-Gītā definitions"), His [lover](/definition/lover#history "show lover definitions")’s thoughts are rivetted to Him, their lives are nestled in Him and their conversation is solely about Him, full of mutual enlightenment and entertainment. The debate, referred to, in this Song, could arise from the adoration of the Lord by the Celestials, from different angles, one group talking about the Lord’s transcendent glory and the other about His easy accessibility and loving condescension. The [Āḻvār](/definition/aḻvar#vaishnavism "show Āḻvār definitions") marvels at that even his faculties vie with the experience of that exalted band in heaven.
