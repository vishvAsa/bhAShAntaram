மணந்தபேர்ஆயா! மாயத்தால்முழுதும் வல்வினையேனை ஈர்கின்ற  
குணங்களை உடையாய் அசுரர் வன்கையர்கூற்றமே! கொடிய புள்உயர்த்தாய்  
பணங்கள்ஆயிரமும் உடைய பைந்நாகப்பள்ளியாய்! பாற்கடல் சேர்ப்பா  
வணங்குமாறு அறியேன்! மனமும் வாசகமும் செய்கையும் யானும் நீதானே.

maṇantapērāyā! māyattālmuḻutum valviṉaiyēṉai īrkiṉṟa  
kuṇaṅkaḷai uṭaiyāy acurar vaṉkaiyarkūṟṟamē! koṭiya puḷuyarttāy  
paṇaṅkaḷāyiramum uṭaiya painnākappaḷḷiyāy! [pāṟkaṭal](/definition/parkatal#vaishnavism "show pāṟkaṭal definitions") cērppā  
vaṇaṅkumāṟu aṟiyēṉ! maṉamum vācakamum ceykaiyum yāṉum nītāṉē.

**English translation of verse 8.1.8:**

Mighty [Gopāla](/definition/gopala#vaishnavism "show Gopāla definitions"), Piṉṉai, You did wed with love intense,  
Your auspicious traits, in their full complement, [tear](/definition/tear#history "show tear definitions") into halve  
This sinner great, deadly unto the mighty Asuras, You have  
On Your banner [Garuḍa](/definition/garuda#vaishnavism "show Garuḍa definitions"), who does on them miseries impose,  
In the Milk-ocean, on the thousand-hooded [serpent](/definition/serpent#history "show serpent definitions") You repose;  
I and my mind, word and deed are all swayed by You,  
And so, I know not how I can, on my own, worship You.

**Notes:**

\(i\) The [Āḻvār](/definition/aḻvar#vaishnavism "show Āḻvār definitions") would appear to have been pulled up by the Lord as to why he did not even make a formal obeisance to Him. The Āḻvār clears up the position by pointing out that, as one who belongs to Him, lock, stock and barrel, and is wholly dominated by Him, even this formal act of bowing has to be ordained by Him.

\(ii\) The very traits of the Lord, which do sustain the devotees, are proving injurious to the Āḻvār in his present disconsolate state, making his separation from the Lord all the more poignant. The Āḻvār attributes this mental state to his sins. Wounds inflicted by missiles could be cured but not the sickness imposed by the Lord’s traits themselves. The ungodly Asuras are destroyed by the Lord’s [weapons](/definition/weapon#history "show weapons definitions") but His auspicious traits, strangely enough, [torment](/definition/torment#history "show torment definitions") the devout like Saint [Nammāḻvār](/definition/nammalvar#vaishnavism "show Nammāḻvār definitions"), as he puts it in this song, [splitting](/definition/splitting#history "show splitting definitions") him into halves, even as [Hiraṇya](/definition/hiranya#history "show Hiraṇya definitions") was cleaved by Lord [Narasiṃha](/definition/narasimha#history "show Narasiṃha definitions").

\(iii\) Ādi-Śeṣa, the Lord’s serpent-bed, can, on his spacious bosom, accommodate the Lord and His Consorts; his thousand hoods spread themselves out and [dance](/definition/dance#history "show dance definitions") with great joy because of his contact with the Lord.

\(iv\) Mind, body and speech of the sentient being are the Lord’s gifts, capacitating the individual for [worshipping](/definition/worshipping#history "show worshipping definitions") Him and yet, the Āḻvār could not, on his own, bow unto the Lord, because he and his appendages, the mind etc., are all wholly dominated by Him. This is indeed the farthest limit of self-abnegation, totally objuring the element of self-effort, ([Sādhana](/definition/sadhana#vaishnavism "show Sādhana definitions") yogyatā), that is, employing ‘Means’ other than the Lord Himself.
