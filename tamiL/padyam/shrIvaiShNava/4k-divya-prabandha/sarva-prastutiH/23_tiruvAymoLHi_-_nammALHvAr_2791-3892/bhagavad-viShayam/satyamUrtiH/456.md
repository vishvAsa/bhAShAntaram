**[Tamil](/definition/tamil#history "show Tamil definitions") text and transliteration:**

மைய கண்ணாள் மலர் மேல் உறைவாள் உறை மார்பினன்,  
செய்ய கோலத் தடங் கண்ணன் விண்ணோர் பெருமான் தன்னை,  
மொய்ய சொல்லால் இசைமாலைகள் ஏத்தி உள்ளப்பெற்றேன்,  
வெய்ய நோய்கள் முழுதும் வியன் ஞாலத்து வீயவே.

maiya kaṇṇāḷ malar mēl uṟaivāḷ uṟai mārpiṉaṉ,  
ceyya kōlat taṭaṅ kaṇṇaṉ viṇṇōr perumāṉ taṉṉai,  
moyya collāl icaimālaikaḷ ētti uḷḷappeṟṟēṉ,  
veyya nōykaḷ muḻutum viyaṉ ñālattu vīyavē.

**English translation of verse 4.5.2:**

Blest am I, while still in this sprawling land,  
To contemplate and laud [thro](/definition/thro#history "show thro definitions")’ hymnal garlands,  
Well set, the Lord of Celestials, with large eyes,  
Red and lovely, on whose chest always stays  
[Lakṣmī](/definition/lakshmi#vaishnavism "show Lakṣmī definitions"), the lotus-born with collyrium in her eyes, well set  
And get all dire ills and evils rooted out.

**Notes**

\(i\) It is lakṣmī, the Goddess of plenty and riches, who adds lustre to the Lord’s glory by making His chest, her permanent abode. This glorious conjunction, which the [Āḻvār](/definition/aḻvar#vaishnavism "show Āḻvār definitions") praises, cures all ills and evils. If the Divine Mother looked at the Lord full in the face just once, the latter would feel exhilarated, cool and pleasant, as at the end of a heavy downpour. It is indeed a matter of reciprocity that Lakṣmī’s eyes are dark and the Lord’s eyes are red, the red complexion of the former having got transplanted in the eyes of the latter and the latter’s dark complexion having likewise been transposed, when they gazed at each other.

\(ii\) It is significant that there is no mention in the text, as to whose ills have been rooted out by the Āḻvār’s hymns. Evidently, it is intended to be of universal application and not parochial, benefiting the Āḻvār only, like the poor shade, thin and small, cast by the palmyrah [tree](/definition/tree#history "show tree definitions").
