**English translation of verse 9.2.3:**

How is it, my Lord! You do in Tiruppuḷiṇkuṭi repose  
In one and the same posture ever since You came there,  
Not minding the [pain](/definition/pain#history "show pain definitions") on Your body exquisite? how long more  
Will You in this manner lie? May You shed Your grace  
On us, grown gray in Your service hoary and turn on us  
Your lotus eyes large; may You with Your lotus-born Spouse  
Remain [seated](/definition/seat#history "show seated definitions") so as to be adored by the three worlds spacious!

**Notes:**

\(i\) Having set out, in the two preceding songs, his descent from a lineage of devout men engaged unremittingly in the self-less service of the Lord, the [Āḻvār](/definition/aḻvar#vaishnavism "show Āḻvār definitions") now prays unto Him to concede his wish, as follows: The Lord should rise up and turn His sweet glances on him, be seated along with [Mahālakṣmī](/definition/mahalakshmi#vaishnavism "show Mahālakṣmī definitions"), so as to take service from him and be incidentally worshipped by the denizens of all the three worlds. It is, no [doubt](/definition/doubt#history "show doubt definitions"), a matter well within the knowledge of the Āḻvār that the Lord, in His Iconic Form, remains, for all intents and purposes, static, without altering the posture, initially assumed by Him. And yet, the Āḻvār would want the Lord to get up, be seated and so on. Actually, his predecessor [Tirumaḻicai](/definition/tirumalicai#vaishnavism "show Tirumaḻicai definitions") Āḻvār had similarly entreated Lord Ārāvamutaṉ, enshrined in Tirukkuṭantai ([Kumbakonam](/definition/kumbakonam#history "show Kumbakonam definitions"), in [Tamil Nāḍu](/definition/tamilnadu#history "show Tamil Nāḍu definitions")) to get up and address a few words to him. However, when, in response, the Lord rose from bed a little, the Āḻvār would not be a [party](/definition/party#history "show party definitions") to the Lord disturbing Himself from His much-needed rest and therefore, requested Him to speak without getting up. The Lord is seen there, down to this day, in a posture midway between lying and sitting.

\(ii\) The Āḻvār would appear to have been thinking on these lines: “It is just possible that the Lord in Tiruppuḷiṅkuṭi assumed the lying posture, in response to the request of an ardent devotee. And now, the Āḻvār finds that the Lord has been lying in the same posture far too long, much to His discomfort, and very much wishes that He should certainly readjust the posture, so as to secure physical relief, the more so, when a request to this effect is made by a devotee of his calibre.” Did not Āṇṭāḻ and her confreres request Lord [Kṛṣṇa](/definition/krishna#vaishnavism "show Kṛṣṇa definitions") to get up from bed and walk down to the drawing room to grant them audience, duly seated on the [throne](/definition/throne#history "show throne definitions")?
