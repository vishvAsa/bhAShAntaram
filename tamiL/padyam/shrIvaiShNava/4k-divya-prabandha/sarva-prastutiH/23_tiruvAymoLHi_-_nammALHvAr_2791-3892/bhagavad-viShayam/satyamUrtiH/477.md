**[Tamil](/definition/tamil#history "show Tamil definitions") text and transliteration:**

உன்னித்து மற்று ஒரு தெய்வம் தொழாஅள் அவனை அல்லால்,  
நும் இச்சை சொல்லி நும் தோள் குலைக்கப்படும் அன்னைமீர்,  
மன்னப்படும் மறைவாணனை வண் துவராபதி-  
மன்னனை, ஏத்துமின் ஏத்துதலும் தொழுது ஆடுமே.

uṉṉittu maṟṟu oru teyvam toḻāaḷ avaṉai allāl,  
num iccai colli num tōḷ kulaikkappaṭum aṉṉaimīr,  
maṉṉappaṭum maṟaivāṇaṉai vaṇ tuvarāpati-  
maṉṉaṉai, ēttumiṉ ēttutalum toḻutu āṭumē.

**English translation of verse 4.6.10:**

Mother, You mouth base words at will  
And in awkward [dance](/definition/dance#history "show dance definitions") your shoulders [tremble](/definition/trembling#history "show tremble definitions");  
None but the Lord Supreme this lady will deem  
Fit for worship, You’ll therefore do well to hymn  
In praise of the lovely Prince of Tuvarāpati, by scriptures adored  
And revive this lady, make her dance and go gay galore.

**Notes**

\(i\) The mate insists that the womenfolk should take due note of the Nāyakī’s unbounded love for Lord [Kṛṣṇa](/definition/krishna#vaishnavism "show Kṛṣṇa definitions"), the Prince of [Dvārakā](/definition/dvaraka#vaishnavism "show Dvārakā definitions") and remould their activities suitably. “What fun is it, tending the nose for an injury in the knee?”

\(ii\) Parāṅkuśa Nāyakī has never worshipped any one but the Supreme Lord, not even as a tender child. The crescent moon is usually worshipped by young children but Parāṅkuśa Nāyakī didn’t do that, even at that tender age.

\(iii\) The mate vehemently deprecates the elderly women’s mis-directed activities, ill-fitting and totally unbecoming of the clan to which they belong. By indulging in these activities, they harm themselves as well as the cause they intend to serve, namely, relieving Parāṅkuśa Nāyakī of her sickness. On the other hand, if they praised the Prince of Dvārakā, it will elevate them and also revive the Nāyakī, making her get up and dance with Joy.
