**[Tamil](/definition/tamil#history "show Tamil definitions") text and transliteration:**

மடவரல் அன்னைமீர்கட்கு என்சொல்லிச் சொல்லுகேன்? மல்லைச்செல்வ  
வடமொழி மறைவாணர் வேள்வியுள் நெய்அழல்வான் புகைபோய்த்  
திடவிசும்பில் அமரர் நாட்டை மறைக்கும் தண் திருப்புலியூர்  
படஅரவுஅணையான் தன்நாமம் அல்லால் பரவாள் இவளே.

maṭavaral aṉṉaimīrkaṭku eṉcollic collukēṉ? mallaiccelva  
vaṭamoḻi maṟaivāṇar vēḷviyuḷ neyaḻalvāṉ pukaipōyt  
tiṭavicumpil amarar nāṭṭai maṟaikkum taṇ tiruppuliyūr  
paṭaaravuaṇaiyāṉ taṉnāmam allāl paravāḷ ivaḷē.

**English translation of verse 8.9.8:**

What shall I tell you, elders, about the felicity of this damsel?  
She utters not anything but the holy names of the Lord,  
Who does on hooded [serpent](/definition/serpent#history "show serpent definitions") recline in Tiruppuliyūr cool,  
Whence the fumes of the ritualistic fire lit by [Vedic](/definition/veda#vaishnavism "show Vedic definitions") scholars grand,  
Fed by ghee, right up to the sky, ascend  
And envelop the home of the celestials in the region beyond.

**Notes:**

\(i\) “The Nāyakī would appear to have been attracted by the vedic rites and rituals, in full swing, in Tiruppuliyūr and gone in union with the presiding Deity of the place.” says the mate. The mate is not in a position to say anything more about the Nāyakī. Could it be said that the Nāyakī was subservient to her mate or that the mate was also a [party](/definition/party#history "show party definitions") to the excesses committed by the Nāyakī or that the Nāyakī defied her mate and got out of hand? No, none of these and the mate could do nothing better than writhing her hands disconcertingly. It is indeed surprising that the Nāyakī should describe, without any reserve, the very bed she shared with her Lord, overlooking the fact that her mate was standing beside.

\(ii\) It is noteworthy that the [Āḻvār](/definition/aḻvar#vaishnavism "show Āḻvār definitions"), who is the author of the Tamil [vedas](/definition/veda#vaishnavism "show vedas definitions"), got attracted by the rituals performed according to the [Sanskrit](/definition/sanskrit#history "show Sanskrit definitions") Vedas. These rituals of the Sanskrit Vedas propitiate the Lord, in His ‘[Antaryāmi](/definition/antaryamin#vaishnavism "show Antaryāmi definitions")’ aspect, residing in all things and beings as the Internal Controller but not visible to the naked eye. The hymns of the Tamil vedas aim at service unto the Lord, in His ‘[Arca](/definition/arca#history "show Arca definitions")’ or worshippable Form, being sung in front of Him, to His great delectation.
