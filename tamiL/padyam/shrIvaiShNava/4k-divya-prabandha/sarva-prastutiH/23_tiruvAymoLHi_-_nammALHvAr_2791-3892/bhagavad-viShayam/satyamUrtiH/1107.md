**[Tamil](/definition/tamil#history "show Tamil definitions") text and transliteration:**

அந்தரம் நின்றுஉழல்கின்ற யானுடைப் பூவைகாள்  
நும்திறத்துஏதும் இடைஇல்லை குழறேல்மினோ  
இந்திரஞாலங்கள் காட்டி இவ்ஏழ்உலகும் கொண்ட  
நம் திருமார்பன் நம்ஆவி உண்ண நன்குஎண்ணினான்.

antaram niṉṟuuḻalkiṉṟa yāṉuṭaip pūvaikāḷ  
numtiṟattuētum iṭaiillai kuḻaṟēlmiṉō  
intirañālaṅkaḷ kāṭṭi ivēḻulakum koṇṭa  
nam tirumārpaṉ namāvi uṇṇa naṉkueṇṇiṉāṉ.

**English translation of verse 9.5.5:**

My pet Pūvai [birds](/definition/bird#history "show birds definitions"), You don’t have to sing and [torment](/definition/torment#history "show torment definitions") me,  
For the Lord, Who on His chest holds [Tiru](/definition/tiru#history "show Tiru definitions") ([Mahālakṣmī](/definition/mahalakshmi#vaishnavism "show Mahālakṣmī definitions"))  
Has indeed planned well ahead to finish me off,  
Even as He did the seven worlds get hold of,  
Playing many a wily trick (on Mahābali).

**Notes:**

The Nāyakī points out to her [pet birds](/definition/pet-bird#history "show pet birds definitions"), the futility of their attempts to torment her, as she already stands tormented by her beloved Lord, well set on the path of ending her altogether. In her present state of discomfiture, the  
Nāyakī puts some strange construction on the Lord bearing Mahālakṣmī, His principal Spouse, on His broad chest. This was just to lull the Nāyakī into a sense of false security, by an outward display of His connubial affections. Likewise, she lashes at the Lord, as a downright strategist who seized all the worlds from Mahābali, on the sly. Did He not extend false hopes to her of ever-lasting companionship, during His erstwhile union with her? If this was the ruse, set up by no less than the omnipotent Lord to finish off the Nāyakī, should He need the help of any one else and much less, the help of these tiny birds, to accomplish His task?
