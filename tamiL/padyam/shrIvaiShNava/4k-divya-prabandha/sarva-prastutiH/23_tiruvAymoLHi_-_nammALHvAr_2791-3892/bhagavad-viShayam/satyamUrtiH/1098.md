கண்டுகொண்டு என்கண்இணை ஆரக்களித்து  
பண்டைவினையாயின பற்றோடுஅறுத்து  
தொண்டர்க்கு அமுதுஉண்ணச் சொல்மாலைகள் சொன்னேன்  
அண்டத்துஅமரர் பெருமான்! அடியேனே.

kaṇṭukoṇṭu eṉkaṇiṇai ārakkaḷittu  
paṇṭaiviṉaiyāyiṉa paṟṟōṭuaṟuttu  
toṇṭarkku amutuuṇṇac colmālaikaḷ coṉṉēṉ  
aṇṭattuamarar perumāṉ! aṭiyēṉē.

**English translation of verse 9.4.9:**

Lustily do my eyes feast on the Form exquisite,  
Of the Chief of the Celestials in [Heaven](/definition/heaven#history "show Heaven definitions"), who did eradicate  
My age-long ills and evils and made me His vassal;  
Blessed am I to feed the devout with this nectarean hymnal.

**Notes:**

Not stopping with [enjoying](/definition/enjoying#history "show enjoying definitions") the Lord himself, the [Āḻvār](/definition/aḻvar#vaishnavism "show Āḻvār definitions") extends the delight to others around and to posterity through generations. Indeed, this confers on him a greater joy than that resulting from the severance of his age-long sins and the glorious vision of the Lord. Many indeed are the poets of this world but none has declared the intention in [composing](/definition/composing#history "show composing definitions") the [poems](/definition/poem#history "show poems definitions"), in the manner the Āḻvār has done, in this song. [Tiruvāymoḻi](/definition/tiruvaymoli#vaishnavism "show Tiruvāymoḻi definitions") has been graciously composed by the Saint in order to nourish the Lord’s devotees with the nectarean sweetness of its contents. The opening word “Bhaktāmṛtam”, the ambrosia for God-lovers, in the opening invocatory [śloka](/definition/sloka#vaishnavism "show śloka definitions"), composed by Śrīman [Nāthamuni](/definition/nathamuni#vaishnavism "show Nāthamuni definitions"), is derived from this song, based on the Āḻvār’s intention, as set out, in this song.
