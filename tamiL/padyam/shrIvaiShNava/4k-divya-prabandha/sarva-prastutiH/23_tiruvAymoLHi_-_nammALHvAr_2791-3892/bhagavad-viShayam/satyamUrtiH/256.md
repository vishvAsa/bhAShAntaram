In the last decad, the [Āḻvār](/definition/aḻvar#vaishnavism "show Āḻvār definitions") stressed the need for quick action on the part of the Lord, while praying that He should take service from him, at all times. The Āḻvār’s agitation for expeditious result was, however, construed by the Lord as the Āḻvār’s desire to serve in this body itself and He, therefore, directed the Āḻvār to serve Him in His Iconic Form in Tirumāliruñcōlai [malai](/definition/malai#history "show malai definitions") (very near to [Maturai](/definition/maturai#vaishnavism "show Maturai definitions") in the South), a nice, quiet place, abounding in lovely hills and beautiful orchards. The Āḻvār accordingly enjoys alike the pilgrim centre and the Lord enshrined there, his predilections extending even to the other hills, in and around, and the very route leading thereto.
