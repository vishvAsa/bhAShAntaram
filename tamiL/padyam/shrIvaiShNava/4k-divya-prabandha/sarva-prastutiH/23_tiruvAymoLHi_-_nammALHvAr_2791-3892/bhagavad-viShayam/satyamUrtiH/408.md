**[Tamil](/definition/tamil#history "show Tamil definitions") text and transliteration:**

வாழ்ந்தார்கள் வாழ்ந்தது மாமழை மொக்குளின் மாய்ந்து மாய்ந்து,  
ஆழ்ந்தார் என்று அல்லால் அன்று முதல் இன்று அறுதியா,  
வாழ்ந்தார்கள் வாழ்ந்தே நிற்பர் என்பது இல்லை நிற்குறில்,  
ஆழ்ந்து ஆர் கடற்பள்ளி அண்ணல் அடியவர் ஆமினோ.

vāḻntārkaḷ vāḻntatu māmaḻai mokkuḷiṉ māyntu māyntu,  
āḻntār eṉṟu allāl aṉṟu mutal iṉṟu aṟutiyā,  
vāḻntārkaḷ vāḻntē niṟpar eṉpatu illai niṟkuṟil,  
āḻntu ār kaṭaṟpaḷḷi aṇṇal aṭiyavar āmiṉō.

**English translation of verse 4.1.6:**

Probing, since the beginning of time, into the lives of those  
Said to have flourished in this world in yonder days,  
You will find that they stayed not for ever  
In that state but vanished like bubbles in rain water;  
So then, if you seek [life](/definition/life#history "show life definitions") that truly lasts,  
Become the vassal of the Sire Who on the deep ocean rests.

**Note**

The earthly opulence goes on dwindling with the passage of time; from the beginning of creation up till now, it has been seen that the so-called earthly magnates, said to have flourished in this world with all that show of affluence, did not last long. They had their cups of sorrow duly served, while the riches of the mundane world buried them deep into the earth and they could thus never get off the ground to which they got themselves consigned. The Lord’s lotus feet alone can lift us up to eternal existence in its true sense. The Lord reposing on the milk-ocean is concerting ways and means of reclaiming us and it behoves us to co-operate with Him and make His task easier.
