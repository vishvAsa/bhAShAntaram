**[Tamil](/definition/tamil#history "show Tamil definitions") text and transliteration:**

பிரான் பெரு நிலம் கீண்டவன், பின்னும்  
விராய் மலர்த் துழாய் வேய்ந்த முடியன்,  
மராமரம் எய்த மாயவன், என்னுள்  
இரான் எனில் பின்னை யான் ஒட்டுவேனோ?

pirāṉ peru [nilam](/definition/nilam#history "show nilam definitions") kīṇṭavaṉ, piṉṉum  
virāy malart tuḻāy vēynta muṭiyaṉ,  
marāmaram eyta māyavaṉ, eṉṉuḷ  
irāṉ eṉil piṉṉai yāṉ oṭṭuvēṉō?

**English translation of verse 1.7.6:**

1 low can I at all survive, if the Benefactor great  
Who once retrieved the Earth from the ocean,  
On whose crown is the tulacī garland of aroma sweet,  
The wonder-Lord whose [arrow](/definition/arrow#history "show arrow definitions") sped [thro](/definition/thro#history "show thro definitions")’ the [trees](/definition/tree#history "show trees definitions") seven,  
Should desert me and stay not in my heart?

**Note**

This is the [Āḻvār](/definition/aḻvar#vaishnavism "show Āḻvār definitions")’s reply to a question supposed to have been put to him as to what he would do, in case the Lord forsook him once again. The Āḻvār [rules](/definition/rules#history "show rules definitions") out such a contingency, seeing that the Lord is a self-less Benefactor like Sandal paste, flower, southerly breeze and the Moon, catering to the happiness of others, seeking nothing in return. Surely, the Āḻvār would not be a willing [party](/definition/party#history "show party definitions") to the separation and he just can’t survive in such an eventuality. As a matter of fact, the Āḻvār cannot bring himself to believe that the Lord would at all leave him and go without his permission. Did He not, as [Śrī Rāma](/definition/shrirama#history "show Śrī Rāma definitions"), go even to the extent of clearing up the misgivings in the mind of [Sugrīva](/definition/sugriva#vaishnavism "show Sugrīva definitions") about His ability to vanquish [Vāli](/definition/vali#vaishnavism "show Vāli definitions") and infusing the requisite confidence? Could such a one desert the Āḻvār, who has firm faith in Him?
