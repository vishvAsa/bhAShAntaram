**[Tamil](/definition/tamil#history "show Tamil definitions") text and transliteration:**

தாளதாமரையான் உனதுஉந்தியான்  
வாள்கொள் நீளமழுஆளி உன்ஆகத்தான்  
ஆளராய்த்தொழுவாரும் அமரர்கள்  
நாளும் என்புகழ்கோ உனசீலமே?

tāḷatāmaraiyāṉ uṉatuuntiyāṉ  
vāḷkoḷ nīḷamaḻuāḷi uṉākattāṉ  
āḷarāyttoḻuvārum amararkaḷ  
nāḷum eṉpukaḻkō uṉacīlamē?

**English translation of verse 9.3.10:**

You do on your navel bear the one on lotus petal born  
While he who wields the trident, long and bright, does lean  
On your person; tender love you bear unto the [Devas](/definition/deva#vaishnavism "show Devas definitions"), who [pose](/definition/pose#history "show pose definitions")  
As your vassals; were I to laud your grace galore  
Till the end of time, would it exhaust your glory great?

**Notes:**

The [Āḻvār](/definition/aḻvar#vaishnavism "show Āḻvār definitions") is weighed down by the amazing simplicity of the Lord and His grace galore, extended even to the selfish Devas, the denizens of the upper worlds, and the self-centred [Brahmā](/definition/brahma#vaishnavism "show Brahmā definitions") and [Rudra](/definition/rudra#vaishnavism "show Rudra definitions"), by holding the former right on His navel and by assigning a part of His body to the latter.

Surely, even persons, quite competent to sing the Lord’s praise, can never exhaust it, although they sing His glory for all time.
