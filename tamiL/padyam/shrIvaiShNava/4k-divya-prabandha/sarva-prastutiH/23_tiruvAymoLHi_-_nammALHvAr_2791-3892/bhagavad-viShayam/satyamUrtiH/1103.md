**[Tamil](/definition/tamil#history "show Tamil definitions") text and transliteration:**

இன்னுயிர்சேவலும் நீரும் கூவிக்கொண்டு இங்கு எத்தனை  
என்னுயிர் நோவ மிழற்றேல்மின் குயில் பேடைகாள்  
என்னுயிர்க் கண்ணபிரானை நீர் வரக்கூவுகிலீர்  
என்னுயிர் கூவிக்கொடுப்பார்க்கும் இத்தனை வேண்டுமோ? (2)

iṉṉuyircēvalum nīrum kūvikkoṇṭu iṅku ettaṉai  
eṉṉuyir nōva miḻaṟṟēlmiṉ kuyil pēṭaikāḷ  
eṉṉuyirk kaṇṇapirāṉai nīr varakkūvukilīr  
eṉṉuyir kūvikkoṭuppārkkum ittaṉai vēṇṭumō? (2)

**English translation of verse 9.5.1:**

Ye, female Koel-[birds](/definition/bird#history "show birds definitions"), do not my soul [torment](/definition/torment#history "show torment definitions"),  
Cooing around here along with your mates dear;  
Lord Kaṇṇan, dear unto me like [life](/definition/life#history "show life definitions"), You bid not  
To come and meet me and yet, why are you in great flutter,  
To sap my life and unto Him hand it out?

**Notes:**

Seeing the female Koel-birds, in the [company](/definition/company#history "show company definitions") of their [male](/definition/male#history "show male definitions") counterparts, is enough to torment the forlorn [lover](/definition/lover#history "show lover definitions"), that Parāṅkuśa Nāyakī is. If, on the top of this, these birds, well-mated, start cooing their love-notes as well, it would indeed be the farthest limit of forbearance for the desolate Nāyakī. Well, it might be argued that it is not the fault of these birds that they keep cooing, being in their native element. But then, the Nāyakī’s grievance is that these birds, given to cooing in sweet accents, did not oblige her by calling out her bosom Lord to come and join her. Verily, these birds are out to sap her life which the Nāyakī is prepared to give up of her own accord and she, therefore, feels that the birds need not make such a mighty effort, to accomplish their object. What they do is like applying heroic remedies for petty maladies, such as breaking an egg with a club.
