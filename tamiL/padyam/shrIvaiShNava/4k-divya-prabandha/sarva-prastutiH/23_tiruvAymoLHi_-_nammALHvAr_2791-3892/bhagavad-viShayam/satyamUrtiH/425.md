**[Tamil](/definition/tamil#history "show Tamil definitions") text and transliteration:**

என் செய்கேன்? என்னுடைப் பேதை என் கோமளம்,  
என் சொல்லும் என் வசமும் அல்லள் நங்கைமீர்,  
மின் செய் பூண் மார்பினன் கண்ணன் கழல் துழாய்,  
பொன் செய்பூண் மென்முலைக்கு என்று மெலியுமே

eṉ ceykēṉ? eṉṉuṭaip pētai eṉ kōmaḷam,  
eṉ collum eṉ vacamum allaḷ naṅkaimīr,  
miṉ cey pūṇ mārpiṉaṉ kaṇṇaṉ kaḻal tuḻāy,  
poṉ ceypūṇ meṉmulaikku eṉṟu meliyumē

**English translation of verse 4.2.10:**

Ye, ladies, what shall I do with my daughter?  
She listens not to me, being immature and tender,  
Well beyond control, poor thing, she is getting thinner,  
Wanting to decorate her fond but languishing breast  
With tuḷaci worn on the feet of Kaṇṇaṉ on whose chest,  
Broad and bedecked, the [jewels](/definition/jewel#history "show jewels definitions") gleam bright.

**Note**

The ladies, to whom the Mother complains, turn round and ask her whether she could not counsel her daughter suitably and keep her under restraint. The Mother regrets that her daughter has gone out of hand, being enthralled by the charming personality of Śrī [Kṛṣṇa](/definition/krishna#vaishnavism "show Kṛṣṇa definitions"), bedecked with lustrous jewels. Unable to secure the tuḷaci, worn on His feet, with which Parāṅkuśa Nāyakī wants to decorate her emaciated but all the more attractive breast, she is thinning down and the Mother just does not know how to deal with a daughter like this, infatuated with God-love, too deep for words. The Mother cannot punish the daughter because she is not merely immature but much-too-tender to stand the punishment. Bringing the God-intoxicated daughter round to the commonplace standards through routine advice, is also out of the question.
