It was indeed a grand [poetic](/definition/poetry#history "show poetic definitions") imagery of the [Āḻvār](/definition/aḻvar#vaishnavism "show Āḻvār definitions"), conjuring up the vision of the Lord, as an [emerald](/definition/emerald#history "show emerald definitions") mountain, tall and lovely, moving along, bearing on its crest the radiant Sun and the silvery Moon all at once vide VIII-2-10. The Āḻvār could not lift his mind off this spectacular grandeur and, at the same time, this made him apprehensive of the safety of the Lord, so charming, who in this exquisite Form, moves about alone and unattended in this wicked world peopled by the ungodly and the selfish. The Āḻvār, felt vexed that there was none else to share his anxiety in this regard. While the Celestials in [Heaven](/definition/heaven#history "show Heaven definitions") are soaked in ‘Brahmānubhava’, drinking deep of that perennial nectarean spring, namely, the Lord in that glorious transcendent setting, the worldlings are engrossed with sensual pleasures, [Brahmā](/definition/brahma#vaishnavism "show Brahmā definitions") and other [Devas](/definition/deva#vaishnavism "show Devas definitions") would not hesitate to secure their selfish ends involving the Lord in battling against the ungodly Asurās and making Him the target of the [arrows](/definition/arrow#history "show arrows definitions") of the hostile hordes. When the Saint voiced forth his [fear](/definition/fear#history "show fear definitions"), as above, the Lord set him at ease, by pointing out that there was hardly any room for such [fears](/definition/fear#history "show fears definitions"), surrounded as He always is by the ‘[Nityās](/definition/nitya#vaishnavism "show Nityās definitions")’, ‘[Muktās](/definition/mukta#vaishnavism "show Muktās definitions")’ and the devout seekers of [salvation](/definition/salvation#history "show salvation definitions"). The Āḻvār then regains his composure, rid of his erstwhile fears. The initial disquietude is reflected in the third song of this decad and its clearance is revealed in the tenth song.
