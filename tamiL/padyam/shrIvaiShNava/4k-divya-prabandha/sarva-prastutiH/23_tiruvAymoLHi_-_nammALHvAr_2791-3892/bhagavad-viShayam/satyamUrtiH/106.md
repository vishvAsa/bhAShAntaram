நாதன்ஞாலம்கொள் பாதன், என்னம்மான்,  
ஓதம்போல்கிளர், வேதநீரனே.

ōtampōlkiḷar, vētanīraṉē.

**English translation of verse 1.8.10:**

The Sovereign Master (of the whole universe) whose feet  
Measured all the worlds is my Sire upright fit, indeed  
For the [Vedas](/definition/veda#vaishnavism "show Vedas definitions") (vociferous like the ocean) to talk about.

**Note**

The [Āḻvār](/definition/aḻvar#vaishnavism "show Āḻvār definitions"), who was all along maintaining that the Supreme Lord’s numerous incarnations were all for his sake, now says: “Who am I to voice forth the loving tenderness of the Lord, His uprightness which induced Him to incarnate so many times and iṇ so many ways? None is more competent to talk about Him Who, as Tṛivikrama, set His feet on one and all without distinction of high and low, than the Vedas, vociferous like the oceanic waters, in [singing](/definition/singing#history "show singing definitions") His glorious traits”.
