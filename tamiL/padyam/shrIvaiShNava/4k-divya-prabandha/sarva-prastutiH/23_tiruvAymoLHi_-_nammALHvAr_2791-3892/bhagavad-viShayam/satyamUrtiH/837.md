The [Āḻvār](/definition/aḻvar#vaishnavism "show Āḻvār definitions"), who revelled in the last decad, recounting some of the Lord’s glorious deeds, cites some more achievements of the Lord’s glorious deeds, cites some more achievements of the Lord in this decad, much to his own delectation. At the same time, he could not help wondering how the worldlings, whose birthright it is to share this enjoyment, kept aloof and he even felt vexed with them for their callous indifference. What a pity! Oblivious of the huge treasure of [gold](/definition/gold#history "show gold definitions"), buried within inches right in the centre courtyard of their [houses](/definition/house#history "show houses definitions"), these folks struggle elsewhere with swollen feet in search of fleeting wealth of no consequence.
