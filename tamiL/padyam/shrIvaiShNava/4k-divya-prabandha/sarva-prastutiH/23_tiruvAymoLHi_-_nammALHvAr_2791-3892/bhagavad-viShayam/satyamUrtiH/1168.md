**[Tamil](/definition/tamil#history "show Tamil definitions") text and transliteration:**

மாலைநண்ணித் தொழுதுஎழுமினோ வினைகெட  
காலைமாலை கமலமலர் இட்டு நீர்  
வேலைமோதும் மதிள்சூழ் திருக்கண்ணபுரத்து  
ஆலின்மேல்ஆல் அமர்ந்தான் அடிஇணைகளே. (2)

mālainaṇṇit toḻutueḻumiṉō viṉaikeṭa  
kālaimālai kamalamalar iṭṭu nīr  
vēlaimōtum matiḷcūḻ tirukkaṇṇapurattu  
āliṉmēlāl amarntāṉ aṭiiṇaikaḷē. (2)

**English translation of verse 9.10.1:**

Get near the Māl [Lord] at Tirukkaṇṇapuram, surrounded by [walls](/definition/wall#history "show walls definitions"),  
The oceanic waves dash against, the One that on a fig-leaf lay  
On a sheet of water vast and worship, ye. men, one and all,  
Placing lotus flowers at His lovely pair of feet, night and day  
And [salvation](/definition/salvation#history "show salvation definitions") attain, purged of your sins, one and all.

**Notes:**

\(i\) What the [Āḻvār](/definition/aḻvar#vaishnavism "show Āḻvār definitions") preaches, in this decad, is briefly mentioned here. There is indeed no restriction on the flowers with which the Lord is to be worshipped. No flower is taboo and, in the name of [burning](/definition/burning#history "show burning definitions") [incense](/definition/incense#history "show incense definitions"), as part of worship, even a [heap](/definition/heap#history "show heap definitions") of garbage could be [burnt](/definition/burning#history "show burnt definitions") and smoke raised therefrom. The outward offerings may be trifles but, in God’s eyes, they carry much weight when offered with humility and devotion.

\(ii\) The sea seems to have receded from the [township](/definition/township#history "show township definitions") since; it might have been right on the sea-shore, with the billows breaking against the [temple](/definition/temple#history "show temple definitions") walls, during the days of the Āḻvār.
