**[Tamil](/definition/tamil#history "show Tamil definitions") text and transliteration:**

வார்புனல் அம் தண் அருவி வடதிருவேங்கடத்து எந்தை,  
பேர்பல சொல்லிப் பிதற்றி பித்தர் என்றே பிறர்கூற,  
ஊர்பல புக்கும் புகாதும் உலோகர் சிரிக்க நின்று ஆடி,  
ஆர்வம் பெருகிக் குனிப்பார் அமரர் தொழப்படுவாரே.

vārpuṉal am taṇ aruvi vaṭatiruvēṅkaṭattu entai,  
pērpala collip pitaṟṟi pittar eṉṟē piṟarkūṟa,  
ūrpala pukkum pukātum ulōkar cirikka niṉṟu āṭi,  
ārvam perukik kuṉippār amarar toḻappaṭuvārē.

**English translation of verse 3.5.8:**

Those that articulate, with yearning deep, the names many  
Of our Lord in [Vaṭa](/definition/vata#history "show Vaṭa definitions") Tiruvēṅkaṭam, with its fountains many  
And cool, nice cascades, pass in and out of many a town,  
[Singing](/definition/singing#history "show Singing definitions") and [dancing](/definition/dancing#history "show dancing definitions") in ecstasy like mad men,  
By worldlings ridiculed, will be worshipped by those in [heaven](/definition/heaven#history "show heaven definitions").

**Note**

The [Āḻvār](/definition/aḻvar#vaishnavism "show Āḻvār definitions") extols those who worship the Lord in His [Arcā](/definition/arca#history "show Arcā definitions") form at the various pilgrim centres, like Tiruvēṅkaṭam, despite their being steeped in ‘[Saṃsāra](/definition/samsara#history "show Saṃsāra definitions")’ in an abode notorious for its nescience. These men the Āḻvār would like to place in a category even above those exalted Souls in Heaven. Seeing that the Supreme Lord in His Arcā form wherein converge all auspicious attributes in unlimited measure, is near at hand, easily accessible, these men go into a trance and keep on singing and dancing with wild joy, moving round towns and [villages](/definition/village#history "show villages definitions"), completely absorbed in devotion. While the worldlings callously look on with wonder and [amusement](/definition/amusement#history "show amusement definitions"), as they do in the case of mad men, even the [Nitya](/definition/nitya#vaishnavism "show Nitya definitions") Sūris, the ever-free angels in heaven, adore these devotees on Earth running riot with God-love. (The episode relating to Mīḷakāḻvāṉ, cited in the notes below III-5-5, could be recapitulated here as well.)
