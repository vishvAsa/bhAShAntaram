**[Tamil](/definition/tamil#history "show Tamil definitions") text and transliteration:**

குறுக மிக உணர்வத்தொடு நோக்கி எல்லாம்விட்ட,  
இறுகல் இறப்பு என்னும் ஞானிக்கும் அப் பயன் இல்லையேல்,  
சிறுக நினைவது ஓர் பாசம் உண்டாம் பின்னும் வீடு இல்லை,  
மறுகல் இல் ஈசனைப் பற்றி விடாவிடில் வீடு அஃதே.

kuṟuka mika uṇarvattoṭu nōkki ellāmviṭṭa,  
iṟukal iṟappu eṉṉum ñāṉikkum ap payaṉ illaiyēl,  
ciṟuka niṉaivatu ōr pācam uṇṭām piṉṉum vīṭu illai,  
maṟukal il īcaṉaip paṟṟi viṭāviṭil vīṭu aḵtē.

**English translation of verse 4.1.10:**

Even the gnostic who, [thro](/definition/thro#history "show thro definitions")’ many an austerity, strives  
For mere emancipation from rebirth and remains shut unto service divine,  
Shall be, by petty desires, impediments to his goal beset  
Or shall in self-enjoyment be for ever lost;  
Better seek, therefore, refuge in the immaculate Lord  
And reap the bliss supreme that does for ever last.

**Note**

The [Āḻvār](/definition/aḻvar#vaishnavism "show Āḻvār definitions") exhorts people to give up striving after ‘[Kaivalya](/definition/kaivalya#vaishnavism "show Kaivalya definitions") [Mokṣa](/definition/moksha#vaishnavism "show Mokṣa definitions")’, even though it is everlasting, unlike the limited stay in [Svarga](/definition/svarga#vaishnavism "show Svarga definitions") and seek, instead, the Supreme bliss of eternal service unto the Lord, as enunciated in the opening stanza of this decad. The ‘Kaivalya Niṣṭa’ subjects himself to an extremely rigorous course of mental and physical discipline in his attempt to perceive the Soul within and hold an exclusive rapport with it. In the process, he studiously eschews all other values of [life](/definition/life#history "show life definitions") and it is indeed most unfortunate that this exclusiveness even goes as far as keeping him away from God-consciousness and God-love. Thus, devoid of Divine grace, these people run the risk of not attaining their cherished goal of self-realisation, getting tainted by some petty desires lurking in remote corner of their minds during the last moments of their lives, which will put them back into the vicious cycle of [birth](/definition/birth#history "show birth definitions") and [death](/definition/death#history "show death definitions") as in the case of Ādi-[Bharata](/definition/bharata#vaishnavism "show Bharata definitions") (Jaḍabharata) who got distracted by tender solicitude for his pet deer at the crucial moment.
