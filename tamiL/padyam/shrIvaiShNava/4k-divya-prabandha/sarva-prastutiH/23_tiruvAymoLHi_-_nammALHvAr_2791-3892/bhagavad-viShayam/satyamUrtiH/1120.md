திருவருள் செய்பவன்போல என்னுள்புகுந்து  
உருவமும் ஆருயிரும் உடனே உண்டான்  
திருவளர்சோலைத் தென்காட்கரைஎன்அப்பன்  
கருவளர்மேனி என்கண்ணன் கள்வங்களே.

**English translation of verse 9.6.5:**

How stealthy indeed are the ways of the dark-hued Lord!  
Kaṇṇaṉ, my Sire, Who in Teṉkāṭkarai dwells amid lovely orchards,  
Entered my heart as if to bestow on me His grace  
And reclaim me, His vassal, but He did on me pounce,  
My body foul and soul dear alike, with delight immense,

**Notes:**

The Lord sheds His grace, according to the [Āḻvār](/definition/aḻvar#vaishnavism "show Āḻvār definitions"), when He takes service from him, true to his essential [nature](/definition/nature#history "show nature definitions"). The Āḻvār welcomed the Lord’s entry into the interior of his heart, thinking that it would help to sustain his basic stance, as His exclusive vassal from time immemorial. But what actually transpired sent him aghast. Prior to the dawn of true knowledge of his essential nature and his relationship unto the Lord, the Āḻvār mistook his body for the soul and lavished his affections on it (body). But the spiritually regenerated Āḻvār would hate it, as something foul, full of dirt, as set out in the opening song of his very first hymnal ([Tiruviruttam](/definition/tiruviruttam#vaishnavism "show Tiruviruttam definitions")). And yet, the Lord, in His unbounded love for the Āḻvār, took to his body also with great relish, making the Āḻvār look on Him with bewildering excitement.
