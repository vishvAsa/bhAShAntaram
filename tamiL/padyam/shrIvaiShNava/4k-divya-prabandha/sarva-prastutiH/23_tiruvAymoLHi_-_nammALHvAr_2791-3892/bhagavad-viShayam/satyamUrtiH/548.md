**[Tamil](/definition/tamil#history "show Tamil definitions") text and transliteration:**

பொலிக பொலிக பொலிக! போயிற்று வல் உயிர்ச் சாபம்  
நலியும் நரகமும் நைந்த நமனுக்கு இங்கு யாது ஒன்றும் இல்லை  
கலியும் கெடும் கண்டுகொண்மின் கடல்வண்ணன் பூதங்கள் மண்மேல்  
மலியப் புகுந்து இசைபாடி ஆடி உழிதரக் கண்டோம். (2)

polika polika polika! pōyiṟṟu val uyirc cāpam  
naliyum narakamum nainta namaṉukku iṅku yātu oṉṟum illai  
kaliyum keṭum kaṇṭukoṇmiṉ kaṭalvaṇṇaṉ pūtaṅkaḷ maṇmēl  
maliyap pukuntu icaipāṭi āṭi uḻitarak kaṇṭōm. (2)

**English translation of verse 5.2.1:**

Hail! hail! hail! the state of affairs new!  
Gone are the sins heavy, the [hells](/definition/hell#history "show hells definitions") with miseries strewn  
Have been destroyed; no work here for [Yama](/definition/yama#vaishnavism "show Yama definitions")’s hordes  
And [Kali](/definition/kali#history "show Kali definitions") too will soon be destroyed, please note.  
Seen everywhere are the devotees of the sea-hued Lord,  
[Singing](/definition/singing#history "show Singing definitions") sweet songs in His praise, all over the land.

**Notes:**

\(i\) The [Āḻvār](/definition/aḻvar#vaishnavism "show Āḻvār definitions") says, “May this state of affairs flourish!” thrice over, after the [Vedic](/definition/veda#vaishnavism "show Vedic definitions") pattern of “[Śāntiḥ](/definition/shanti#history "show Śāntiḥ definitions"), Śāntiḥ, Śāntiḥ”.

\(ii\) All sins, however, deadly, having been destroyed, there is no question of the Subjects going to [hell](/definition/hell#history "show hell definitions") and hence, there is no work for Yama, so far as the denizens of this abode are concerned.

\(iii\) Even Kali [Puruṣa](/definition/purusha#vaishnavism "show Puruṣa definitions") will soon become defunct-this was the prophesy of no less than Saint [Nammāḻvār](/definition/nammalvar#vaishnavism "show Nammāḻvār definitions"), blessed by the Supreme Lord with far-sighted knowledge, envisioning the future advent of Tirumaṅkai Āḻvār and Śrī Rāmānuja. The expression, “Please note”, carries with it an aura of certainty, the sure fulfilment of this prophesy. This is further reinforced by saying that the entire land is [filled](/definition/filling#history "show filled definitions") with devotees, singing the Lord’s praise, leaving no room whatsoever for Yama and his hordes or Kali and his agents to step in and play their pranks.
