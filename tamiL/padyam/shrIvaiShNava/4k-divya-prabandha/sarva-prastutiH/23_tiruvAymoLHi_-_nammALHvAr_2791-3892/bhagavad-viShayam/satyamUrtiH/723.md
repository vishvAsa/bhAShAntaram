Into mental imbalance, steeped in deep [meditation](/definition/meditation#history "show meditation definitions")

And (unto [Brahmā](/definition/brahma#vaishnavism "show Brahmā definitions")) the sanctified [Vedas](/definition/veda#vaishnavism "show Vedas definitions") did gift.

The mother now says that her daughter (Parāṅkuśa Nāyakī) has, in her present state of dejection, lost the perspective and begun to [doubt](/definition/doubt#history "show doubt definitions") seriously the veracity of these statements. She is perhaps inclined to think that Sages [Vyāsa](/definition/vyasa#vaishnavism "show Vyāsa definitions"), [Parāśara](/definition/parashara#history "show Parāśara definitions") and [Vālmīki](/definition/valmiki#vaishnavism "show Vālmīki definitions") might have been hired out by the Lord to say quite a few good things about Him. which, in reality, do not hold good.
