**[Tamil](/definition/tamil#history "show Tamil definitions") text and transliteration:**

வினைவல் இருள்என்னும் முனைகள் வெருவிப்போம்  
சுனை நல் மலர்இட்டு நினைமின் நெடியானே.

viṉaival iruḷeṉṉum muṉaikaḷ veruvippōm  
cuṉai nal malariṭṭu niṉaimiṉ neṭiyāṉē.

**English translation of verse 10.5.10:**

Sins in their multitude and nescience dense,  
Shall, in sheer fright, clear out,  
When you on the Lord Supreme meditate  
And worship Him with nice flowers, fresh from ponds.

**Notes:**

\(i\) While the first song of this decad is in elucidation of ‘Tirumantra’ and the seventh deals with ‘[Dvaya](/definition/dvaya#history "show Dvaya definitions")’, the ‘[Mantra](/definition/mantra#vaishnavism "show Mantra definitions") [Ratna](/definition/ratna#history "show Ratna definitions")’ the later songs of this decad have a bearing on ‘*CARAMA [ŚLOKA](/definition/sloka#vaishnavism "show ŚLOKA definitions")*’ ([Bhagavad Gita](/definition/bhagavad-gita#vaishnavism "show Bhagavad Gita definitions") XVIII-66), wherein Lord [Kṛṣṇa](/definition/krishna#vaishnavism "show Kṛṣṇa definitions") assured [Arjuna](/definition/arjuna#vaishnavism "show Arjuna definitions") of release from all sins (Sarva pāpebhyo mokṣayiṣyāmi).

\(ii\) The [Āḻvār](/definition/aḻvar#vaishnavism "show Āḻvār definitions") calls upon people to worship the Lord with flowers, easily procured from ponds, and even if this slight effort is not possible, they will do well to just meditate on the Lord Who keeps thinking of His subjects all the time and leads them on to exalted positions (Ahaṃ smarāmi Madbhaktaṃ nayāmi paramāṃ gathiṃ).
