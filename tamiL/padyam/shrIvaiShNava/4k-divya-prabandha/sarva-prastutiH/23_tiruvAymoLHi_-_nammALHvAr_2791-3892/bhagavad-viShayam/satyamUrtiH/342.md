**[Tamil](/definition/tamil#history "show Tamil definitions") text and transliteration:**

தோற்றம் கேடு அவை இல்லவன் உடையான் அவன் ஒரு மூர்த்தியாய்,  
சீற்றத்தோடு அருள் பெற்றவன் அடிக்கீழ்ப் புகநின்ற செங்கண்மால்,  
நாற்றம் தோற்றம் சுவை ஒலி உறல் ஆகி நின்ற, எம் வானவர்  
ஏற்றையே அன்றி மற்றொருவரை யான் இலேன் எழுமைக்குமே.

cīṟṟattōṭu aruḷ peṟṟavaṉ aṭikkīḻp pukaniṉṟa ceṅkaṇmāl,  
nāṟṟam tōṟṟam cuvai oli uṟal āki niṉṟa, em vāṉavar

**English translation of verse 3.6.6:**

At no time shall I seek refuge in any one,  
Other than my red lotus-eyed Lord, full of love For his devotees  
Who is unto me all the senses five.  
The subtle matter of smell, colour, taste, touch and sound;  
Chief of Celestials, free from [birth](/definition/birth#history "show birth definitions") and [death](/definition/death#history "show death definitions"),  
He owns us all mortals; the peerless one (Naraciṅka) full of fury He was  
And yet stood at His feet ([Prahlāda](/definition/prahlada#vaishnavism "show Prahlāda definitions")) the recipient of His grace.

**Notes**

\(i\) The [Āḻvār](/definition/aḻvar#vaishnavism "show Āḻvār definitions") avers that He belongs to none but Naraciñka, the incarnate Form of the Lord, who exhibited boundless love for Prahlāda. To the question put to Śrī Rāmānuja, how the little lad, Prahlāda, could at all approach the ferocious Naraciṅka, when He was [pouring](/definition/pouring#history "show pouring definitions") His unmitigated wrath on Hhaṇya, the great [Ācārya](/definition/acarya#vaishnavism "show Ācārya definitions") replied in a homely way that eveṅ while the [lion](/definition/lion#history "show lion definitions") attacks the [elephant](/definition/elephant#history "show elephant definitions"), the lion cub could jolly well suck milk from the mother’s teats.

\(ii\) The eyes of the Lord could be red, both ways, that is, due to the wrath of Naraciṅka for [Hiraṇya](/definition/hiranya#history "show Hiraṇya definitions") or due to His tender love for Prahlāda.

\(iii\) The five senses, namely, smell, sight, taste, sound and touch, which are differently experienced by the worldlings with reference to the external objects of the visible world, are all experienced in the Lord Himself by the Āḻvār, like unto the ‘[Nitya](/definition/nitya#vaishnavism "show Nitya definitions") Sūris’ (ever-free angels) in [Heaven](/definition/heaven#history "show Heaven definitions"). These senses have a meaning for them only in relation to God-enjoyment.
