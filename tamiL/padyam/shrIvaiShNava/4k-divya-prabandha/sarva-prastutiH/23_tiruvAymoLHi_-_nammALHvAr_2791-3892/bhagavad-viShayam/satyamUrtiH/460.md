**[Tamil](/definition/tamil#history "show Tamil definitions") text and transliteration:**

கரிய மேனிமிசை வெளிய நீறு சிறிதே இடும்,  
பெரிய கோலத் தடங்கண்ணன் விண்ணோர் பெருமான் தன்னை,  
உரிய சொல்லால் இசைமாலைகள் ஏத்தி உள்ளப்பெற்றேற்கு,  
அரியது உண்டோ எனக்கு இன்று தொட்டும் இனி என்றுமே?

kariya mēṉimicai veḷiya nīṟu ciṟitē iṭum,  
periya kōlat taṭaṅkaṇṇaṉ viṇṇōr perumāṉ taṉṉai,  
uriya collāl icaimālaikaḷ ētti uḷḷappeṟṟēṟku,  
ariyatu uṇṭō eṉakku iṉṟu toṭṭum iṉi eṉṟumē?

**English translation of verse 4.5.6:**

Could there be anything scarce for me, now and beyond.  
Blest that I am to praise [thro](/definition/thro#history "show thro definitions")’ hymnal garlands,  
In diction appropriate, the Chief of Celestials, my Lord  
Whose large eyes lovely are with collyrium gently smeared?

**Notes**

\(i\) To a question put by the Lord to the [Āḻvār](/definition/aḻvar#vaishnavism "show Āḻvār definitions") what he needs, pat goes the reply from him, saturated with divine bliss, that there is scarcely a thing he hasn’t got already and there would be nothing beyond attainment in the days to come. This depicts the mental state of the divine bard, in the realm of ecstasy, born of [singing](/definition/singing#history "show singing definitions") ‘[Tiruvāymoḻi](/definition/tiruvaymoli#vaishnavism "show Tiruvāymoḻi definitions")’, which stands on a pedestal of its own; It contains nothing but the praise of ‘Tirumāl’ (Lord [Viṣṇu](/definition/vishnu#vaishnavism "show Viṣṇu definitions")), in choice diction, true to the Āḻvār’s resolve in ‘[Tiruviruttam](/definition/tiruviruttam#vaishnavism "show Tiruviruttam definitions")’, the first of his four works. Indeed, he who is inspired by God Himself, becomes the most worthy instrument to praise Him; he becomes the Lord’s own poet. In his [Rāmāyaṇa](/definition/ramayana#vaishnavism "show Rāmāyaṇa definitions"), Śri [Vālmīki](/definition/valmiki#vaishnavism "show Vālmīki definitions") introduced quite a few extraneous anecdotes, such as the genesis of [Gaṅga](/definition/ganga#vaishnavism "show Gaṅga definitions"), [birth](/definition/birth#history "show birth definitions") of Kārthikeya and so on. Sage [Vyāsa](/definition/vyasa#vaishnavism "show Vyāsa definitions")’s [Mahābhārata](/definition/mahabharata#vaishnavism "show Mahābhārata definitions") also turned out to be a war-memoir, with a bewildering maze of episodes, instead of telling exclusively, the story of [Nārāyaṇa](/definition/narayana#vaishnavism "show Nārāyaṇa definitions"), as the author had intended at the outset. Herein lies the superior merit of Tiruvāymoḻi.

\(ii\) The bewitching eyes of the Lord would certainly need no further beauty-aids and yet, there is the ceremonial application of collyrium.
