**[Tamil](/definition/tamil#history "show Tamil definitions") text and transliteration:**

மாயம் அறிபவர் மாயவற்கு ஆள்அன்றி ஆவரோ,  
தாயம் செறும் ஒரு நூற்றுவர் மங்க ஓர்ஐவர்க்குஆய்,  
தேசம் அறிய ஓர் சாரதியாய்ச் சென்று சேனையை  
நாசம் செய்திட்டு, நடந்த நல் வார்த்தை அறிந்துமே?

māyam aṟipavar māyavaṟku āḷaṉṟi āvarō,  
tāyam ceṟum oru nūṟṟuvar maṅka ōraivarkkuāy,  
tēcam aṟiya ōr cāratiyāyc ceṉṟu cēṉaiyai  
nācam ceytiṭṭu, naṭanta nal vārttai aṟintumē?

**English translation of verse 7.5.9:**

Will those well-versed with the wondrous Lord’s exploits magnificent  
Ever subserve any but Him, so loving and munificent,  
Knowing how He became world-famous as the peerless charioteer,  
For the sake of the illustrious five to whom He did cater,  
Annihilating their hundred coparceners unfriendly and did the armies shatter  
And the heartening word that He went to the Celestium thereafter?

**Notes:**

Oh, what an amazing simplicity! the Supreme Lord of the entire Universe did the mean job of driving [Arjuna](/definition/arjuna#vaishnavism "show Arjuna definitions")’s chariot and that too, in public, on the [battle field](/definition/battle-field#history "show battle field definitions"). When, at his sweet will, a superior person condescends to serve a subordinate, it is usually done *in camera*, and not in public. But here is the Divine charioteer, who not only kept Himself open to public gaze in His Incarnate Form as [Kṛṣṇa](/definition/krishna#vaishnavism "show Kṛṣṇa definitions"), but even to day stands before us, in His Iconic (worshippable)

Form as ‘[Pārtha](/definition/partha#vaishnavism "show Pārtha definitions") [Sārathi](/definition/sarathi#vaishnavism "show Sārathi definitions")’ (Arjuna’s charioteer) at Triplicane ([Tiru](/definition/tiru#history "show Tiru definitions")-[allikkēṇi](/definition/allikkeni#vaishnavism "show allikkēṇi definitions")) in Madras, and as [Pāṇḍava](/definition/pandava#vaishnavism "show Pāṇḍava definitions") Dhūta in [Tamilnadu](/definition/tamilnadu#history "show Tamilnadu definitions") (near Madras) and also in [Kāñcī](/definition/kanci#vaishnavism "show Kāñcī definitions") (also in [Tamil nadu](/definition/tamilnadu#history "show Tamil nadu definitions")).
