**[Tamil](/definition/tamil#history "show Tamil definitions") text and transliteration:**

மனன்அகம் மலம் அற மலர்மிசை எழுதரும்  
மனன் உணர்வு அளவு இலன், பொறி உணர்வு அவை இலன்  
இனன் உணர், முழு நலம், எதிர் நிகழ் கழிவினும்  
இனன் இலன் எனன் உயிர், மிகுநரை இலனே.

maṉaṉakam malam aṟa malarmicai eḻutarum  
maṉaṉ uṇarvu aḷavu ilaṉ, poṟi uṇarvu avai ilaṉ  
iṉaṉ uṇar, muḻu nalam, etir nikaḻ kaḻiviṉum  
iṉaṉ ilaṉ eṉaṉ uyir, mikunarai ilaṉē.

**English translation of verse 1.1.2:**

The Supreme Lord, peerless at all times, past, present and future, the embodiment of bliss and knowledge in their perfection, much beyond the grasp of the senses, cutside the ken of comprehension of even the thoroughly cleansed mind of the [Yogi](/definition/yogi#vaishnavism "show Yogi definitions"), He is my good soul. O my mind, lift yourself up to the dazzling, distress-dispelling feet of such a Great One.

**Notes**

\(i\) In the first stanza, it was said that there was none above the Lord. The [doubt](/definition/doubt#history "show doubt definitions") might, however, arise whether He has any equal and now it is declared that He has no equal either.

\(ii\) It might sound strange that the Lord is beyond the comprehension of even the ‘Yogi with a thoroughly cleansed mind; the fact is, even he can comprehend Him only as infinite and immeasurable, free from the limiting adjuncts of the other two entities (Tattvas), namely, ‘[Jiva](/definition/jiva#vaishnavism "show Jiva definitions")’ (individual soul or ‘cit’, that which perceives) and matter (‘acit’, that which does not perceive).
