In the preceding decad, the [Āḻvār](/definition/aḻvar#vaishnavism "show Āḻvār definitions") suffered the pangs of separation from the Lord, akin to those experienced by the [Gopīs](/definition/gopi#vaishnavism "show Gopīs definitions"), even when the Lord was in their midst. Just as the Gopīs were placated by Lord [Kṛṣṇa](/definition/krishna#vaishnavism "show Kṛṣṇa definitions"), the Āḻvār was pacified by the Lord and his [fears](/definition/fear#history "show fears definitions") were quelled when the Lord assured him that He would no longer get parted from him. Rid of the [fear](/definition/fear#history "show fear definitions") of prolongation of his [bondage](/definition/bondage#history "show bondage definitions"), the Āḻvār is now jubilant over the near prospect of his ascent to the Lord’s feet in [Heaven](/definition/heaven#history "show Heaven definitions"). He, therefore, gets busy in giving the finishing touches, appropriate to this grand hymnal of unparalleled sweetness and grandeur. He has begun to realise the fruits of the devotion ([Bhakti](/definition/bhakti#vaishnavism "show Bhakti definitions")), preached by him to others, right from I-2 and onwards. It may be recalled that [Rāvaṇa](/definition/ravana#vaishnavism "show Rāvaṇa definitions") turned a deaf ear to [Vibhīṣaṇa](/definition/vibhishana#vaishnavism "show Vibhīṣaṇa definitions")’s pious entreaty and advice but it only intensified the latter’s devotion which led him on to [Rāma](/definition/rama#vaishnavism "show Rāma definitions")’s camp itself. This decad sets out how God is attainable through love.
