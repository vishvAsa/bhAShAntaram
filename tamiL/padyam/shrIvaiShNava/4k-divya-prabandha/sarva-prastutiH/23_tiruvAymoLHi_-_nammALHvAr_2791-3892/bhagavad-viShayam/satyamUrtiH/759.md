**[Tamil](/definition/tamil#history "show Tamil definitions") text and transliteration:**

மண்ணும் விண்ணும் மகிழ குறள் ஆய் வலம் காட்டி,  
மண்ணும் விண்ணும் கொண்ட மாய அம்மானே,  
நண்ணி உனை நான் கண்டு உகந்து கூத்தாட,  
நண்ணி ஒருநாள் ஞாலத்தூடே நடவாயே.

maṇṇum viṇṇum makiḻa kuṟaḷ āy valam kāṭṭi,  
maṇṇum viṇṇum koṇṭa [māya](/definition/maya#vaishnavism "show māya definitions") ammāṉē,  
naṇṇi uṉai nāṉ kaṇṭu ukantu kūttāṭa,  
naṇṇi orunāḷ ñālattūṭē naṭavāyē.

**English translation of verse 6.9.2:**

Oh, wondrous Lord, as the midget ([Vāmana](/definition/vamana#history "show Vāmana definitions")), your bewitching Form,  
The whole Universe did enjoy, you did (from [Bali](/definition/bali#vaishnavism "show Bali definitions")) take  
All the worlds; for a day at least, do unto this land come.  
So that I [dance](/definition/dance#history "show dance definitions") around, under the magic spell of your walk.

**Note**

Unto the [Āḻvār](/definition/aḻvar#vaishnavism "show Āḻvār definitions") who invited the Lord to come down here and exhibit His superb Form, the Lord would appear to have told that He would rather comply with the Āḻvār’s request after lifting him up to [Heaven](/definition/heaven#history "show Heaven definitions"), in due course. But the Āḻvār insists that He. who displayed His exquisite Form to Asuras like [Mahā](/definition/maha#history "show Mahā definitions") Bali, shouldn’t hesitate to respond to his (Āḻvār’s) devout call and regale him, right here.
