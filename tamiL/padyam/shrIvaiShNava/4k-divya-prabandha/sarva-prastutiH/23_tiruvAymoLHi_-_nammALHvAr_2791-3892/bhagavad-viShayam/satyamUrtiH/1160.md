எவன் இனிப்புகும்இடம்? எவன் செய்கேனோ? ஆருக்குஎன் சொல்லுகேன் அன்னைமீர்காள்!

**English translation of verse 9.9.6:**

His is indeed the only grace, Him to attain,  
And yet, it is so dear; my [life](/definition/life#history "show life definitions") I can’t hold on  
Till I do His grace obtain, the evening is on,  
Marking the day’s end, pity, I am left alone,  
My mind, my companion in solitude, I do miss,  
My Lord holds Civaṉ, Piramaṉ and Tirumaṭantai, all at once,  
On His lovely person and thus my soul enthrals;  
Ye, elders, what shall I do, where do I shelter take  
And to whom shall I my appeal make?

**Notes:**

“How is it”, the Nāyakī revolves in her mind, “the Lord, Who was anxiously looking out, for some one to be the recipient of His grace, has made it scarce, in my case?” Well, cannot one look up to some one else, for such grace? No, there is no grace but His and yet, the Saint cannot patiently await its descent in due course; his yearning soul can hardly be sustained except by the rapid influx of the Lord’s grace. “What a pity!”, the saint vexes himself, “I can’t have what these blokes, Kāpāli ([Śiva](/definition/shiva#vaishnavism "show Śiva definitions"), holding the skull in hand) and Kantar ([Brahmā](/definition/brahma#vaishnavism "show Brahmā definitions")) could have easy access to”, referring to the allotment of space on His very person by the Lord for them. While the Lord’s navel is the [seat](/definition/seat#history "show seat definitions") of Brahmā, Tirumaṭantai ([Lakṣmī](/definition/lakshmi#vaishnavism "show Lakṣmī definitions")) is inseparably poised on the Lord’s winsome chest and Śiva takes shelter in the space allotted on the right side of the Lord’s body, in times of grave emergency, as a measure of safety.
