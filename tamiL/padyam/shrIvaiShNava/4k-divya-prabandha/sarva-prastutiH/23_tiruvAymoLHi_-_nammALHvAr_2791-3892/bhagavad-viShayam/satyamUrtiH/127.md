**[Tamil](/definition/tamil#history "show Tamil definitions") text and transliteration:**

கண்டாயே நெஞ்சே கருமங்கள் வாய்க்கின்று, ஓர்  
எண் தானும் இன்றியே வந்து இயலுமாறு,  
உண்டானை உலகு ஏழும் ஓர் மூவடி  
கொண்டானைக், கண்டுகொண்டனை நீயுமே.

kaṇṭāyē neñcē karumaṅkaḷ vāykkiṉṟu, ōr  
eṇ tāṉum iṉṟiyē vantu iyalumāṟu,  
uṇṭāṉai ulaku ēḻum ōr mūvaṭi  
koṇṭāṉaik, kaṇṭukoṇṭaṉai nīyumē.

**English translation of verse 1.10.5:**

Haven’t you seen, my mind! how things occur,  
With no pre-thoughts in us? did the worlds seven  
Know that the Lord would, during [deluge](/definition/deluge#history "show deluge definitions"), sustain  
Them all? Who knew that the Lord would measure  
The worlds in three strides and set His feet on them?  
Well, did you ever know that you would see Him?

**Note**

The Lord extends His grace out of His own sweet will, unasked and un-premeditated by us. It is this spontaneous grace of the Lord that Bhaṭṭar has emphasised all along in this decad.
