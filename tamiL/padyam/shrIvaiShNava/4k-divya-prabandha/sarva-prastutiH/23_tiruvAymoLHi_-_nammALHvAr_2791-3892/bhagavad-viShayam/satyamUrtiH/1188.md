**[Tamil](/definition/tamil#history "show Tamil definitions") text and transliteration:**

கூத்தன் கோவலன் குதற்று வல்லசுரர்கள் கூற்றம்  
ஏத்தும் நங்கட்கும் அமரர்க்கும் முனிவர்க்கும் இன்பன்  
வாய்த்த தண்பணை வளவயல்சூழ் திருமோகூர்-  
ஆத்தன் தாமரை அடிஅன்றி மற்றுஇலம் அரணே.

kūttaṉ kōvalaṉ kutaṟṟu vallacurarkaḷ kūṟṟam  
ēttum naṅkaṭkum amararkkum muṉivarkkum iṉpaṉ  
vāytta taṇpaṇai vaḷavayalcūḻ tirumōkūr-  
āttaṉ tāmarai aṭiaṉṟi maṟṟuilam araṇē.

**English translation of verse 10.1.6:**

Shelter have we none but the lotus feet  
Of our Sire at Tirumōkūr, replete  
With [paddy](/definition/paddy#history "show paddy definitions") [fields](/definition/field#history "show fields definitions") and water sheds, cool and bright,  
The divine cow-herd of majestic gait,  
Deadly unto the Asuras who would miseries on others inflict;  
Unto us that extol Him and the [Devas](/definition/deva#vaishnavism "show Devas definitions"), He is sweet indeed.

**Notes:**

\(i\) No [doubt](/definition/doubt#history "show doubt definitions"), [Śiva](/definition/shiva#vaishnavism "show Śiva definitions") is famous as the great dancer (Naṭarājaṉ), full of thrills, but Lord [Rāma](/definition/rama#vaishnavism "show Rāma definitions")’s very gait is said to have been entrancing—c.f. ‘Agrataḥ *prayayau* [Rāmaḥ](/definition/rama#vaishnavism "show Rāmaḥ definitions")’ ([Vālmīki](/definition/valmiki#vaishnavism "show Vālmīki definitions") [Rāmāyaṇa](/definition/ramayana#vaishnavism "show Rāmāyaṇa definitions")) and equally majestic and enthralling was Lord [Kṛṣṇa](/definition/krishna#vaishnavism "show Kṛṣṇa definitions")’s gait.

\(ii\) While the Lord is deadly unto the Asuras who inflict miseries on the devout, He is very dear to His devotees, all alike, making no distinction between the ‘[Nitya](/definition/nitya#vaishnavism "show Nitya definitions") [Sūrīs](/definition/suri#history "show Sūrīs definitions")’ (Eternal Heroes) and the votary just admitted unto His fold. Could there be a greater friend and benefactor than the Lord Who keeps remembering His devotees, all the time, including those last moments of their lives when they remain [unconscious](/definition/unconscious#history "show unconscious definitions") and are no better than a piece of stone or log of wood, and conducts them to the highest state ([Heaven](/definition/heaven#history "show Heaven definitions"))?
