காலம் பெறஎன்னைக் காட்டுமின்கள் காதல் கடலின் மிகப் பெரிதால்,  
நீல முகில்வண்ணத்து எம்பெருமான் நிற்கும்முன்னே வந்துஎன் கைக்கும் எய்தான்,  
ஞாலத்துஅவன் வந்து வீற்றிருந்த நான்மறையாளரும் வேள்வி ஓவா,  
கோலச் செந்நெற்கள் கவரி வீசும் கூடுபுனல் திருப்பேரெயிற்கே.

**English translation of verse 7.3.6:**

Ye, elders, it seems the [cloud](/definition/cloud#history "show cloud definitions")-hued Lord is in front of me  
And yet beyond my reach; alas! my love is bigger than the sea,  
Better take me quick to Tiruppēreyil, the place on Earth  
Where the Lord has come to stay, full of mirth,  
With water in plenty and [paddy](/definition/paddy#history "show paddy definitions") [crops](/definition/crop#history "show crops definitions") lovely, the centre great  
Where [vedic](/definition/veda#vaishnavism "show vedic definitions") scholars zealously perform sacred rites.

**Notes:**

\(i\) The elders point out that the Lord had just left on a [hunting](/definition/hunting#history "show hunting definitions") expedition with her consent and that the Nāyakī should not be so very impatient and that too, so soon. But then the Nāyakī’s consuming passion is such that she can’t brook separation from her Lord even for a short while. Her love is even more expansive than the ocean. That it is fast [gathering](/definition/gathering#history "show gathering definitions") momentum can be seen from the fact that her God-love, as set out in V-3-4, was of the size of the ocean and now it has grown bigger than the ocean. A little later, that is, in the eighth song of this decad itself, we find it surpassing the Earth, the seven peripheral oceans and the ultramundane regions, far beyond as well. In X-10-10, it swells up to such astounding dimensions as to encompass the Supreme Lord Himself, the very object of love.

\(ii\) How could the Nāyakī contain the on-rush of God-love with such rapid strides, and keep it under restraint, as advised by the elders, the more so, when the glorious vision of the blue-hued Lord is right in front, and yet baffles external perception and sensibility? The only way this love could be nurtured is to take her to Tiruppēreyil, where the Lord is in His worshippable form, in all His heavenly splendour, surrounded by profound Vedic scholars, fertile fields and lovely gardens. Even as the paddy crops are sustained by the standing columns of water, the entire landscape of that holy centre sustains the Nāyakī.
