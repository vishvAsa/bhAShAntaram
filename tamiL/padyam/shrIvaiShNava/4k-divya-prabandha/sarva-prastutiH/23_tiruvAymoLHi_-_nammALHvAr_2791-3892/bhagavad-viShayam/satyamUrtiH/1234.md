It was out of deep compassion of unique dimensions that Saint [Nammāḻvār](/definition/nammalvar#vaishnavism "show Nammāḻvār definitions") did, in the midst of his mystic experience, *par excellence*, turn his attention on the people around, from time to time, in order to turn them God-ward. No [doubt](/definition/doubt#history "show doubt definitions"), he found them distressingly unresponsive and at one stage (*vide* stanza 25 of “[Periya Tiruvantāti](/definition/periya-tiruvantati#vaishnavism "show Periya Tiruvantāti definitions")”, the third of Nammāḻvār’s four hymnals), he observed that it would be next to impossible to wean away the worldlings, the incorrigibles and make them God-bent. And yet, so great was his tender solicitude that he went on exhorting them to realise the utter futility of worldly possessions and sensual pleasures and take refuge at the lovely feet of the Supreme Lord, Śrīman [Nārāyaṇa](/definition/narayana#vaishnavism "show Nārāyaṇa definitions"), the surest and the easiest way of securing release from the [bondage](/definition/bondage#history "show bondage definitions") of ‘[Saṃsāra](/definition/samsara#history "show Saṃsāra definitions") We could see this great gesture of the [Āḻvār](/definition/aḻvar#vaishnavism "show Āḻvār definitions"), in every centum of this grand hymnal, from I-2 onwards. This is, however, the last decad in which he tenders advice to the world around and a little hence, we will see him marching to [heaven](/definition/heaven#history "show heaven definitions") through the exalted and exhilarating route, known as the ‘Arcirādhi [mārga](/definition/marga#history "show mārga definitions")’, the route of great distinction, earmarked for the released souls, heaven-bound. It is characteristic of the magnanimous elders of great eminence to say a few [golden](/definition/gold#history "show golden definitions") words, on the eve of their exit from this world, by way of parting advice to the near and dear ones around. The Āḻvār, who is overwhelmingly conscious of the Lord’s eagerness to lift him up to His [Heavenly abode](/definition/heavenly-abode#history "show Heavenly abode definitions") and the almost immediate prospect of his ascent to Heaven, tenders such parting advice in this decad, the very last of the series of lectures, delivered by him, for the edification and elevation of the earth-bound, sense-buried men of the world, c.f. [Vibhīṣaṇa](/definition/vibhishana#vaishnavism "show Vibhīṣaṇa definitions")’s advice to [Rāvaṇa](/definition/ravana#vaishnavism "show Rāvaṇa definitions"), even while leaving [Laṅkā](/definition/lanka#vaishnavism "show Laṅkā definitions"), bound for Lord [Rāma](/definition/rama#vaishnavism "show Rāma definitions")’s Camp—“na naśyanthaṃ upekṣeyam pradīptam śaraṇam yadhā” ([Vālmīki](/definition/valmiki#vaishnavism "show Vālmīki definitions") [Rāmāyaṇa](/definition/ramayana#vaishnavism "show Rāmāyaṇa definitions"), VI.16.22).

The advice conveyed, in this swan-song of the Āḻvār, is short and sweet, the quintessence of ‘Tirumantra’ and ‘[Dvaya](/definition/dvaya#history "show Dvaya definitions")’, calling upon the worldly men to chant Lord Nārāyaṇa’s holy name and serve Him, in conjunction with [Mahālakṣmī](/definition/mahalakshmi#vaishnavism "show Mahālakṣmī definitions"), the Divine Mother, by word ([singing](/definition/singing#history "show singing definitions")), deed (offering choice flowers) and thought (loving [meditation](/definition/meditation#history "show meditation definitions")), vide aphorism 228 of [Ācārya](/definition/acarya#vaishnavism "show Ācārya definitions") Hṛdayam).
