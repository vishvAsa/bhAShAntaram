கற்பகக் கா அன நல் பல தோளற்கு,  
பொன் சுடர்க் குன்று அன்ன பூந்தண் முடியற்கு,  
நல் பல தாமரை நாள் மலர்க் கையற்கு, என்  
வில் புருவக்கொடி தோற்றது மெய்யே.

kaṟpakak kā aṉa nal [pala](/definition/pala#history "show pala definitions") tōḷaṟku,  
poṉ cuṭark kuṉṟu aṉṉa pūntaṇ muṭiyaṟku,  
nal pala tāmarai nāḷ malark kaiyaṟku, eṉ  
vil puruvakkoṭi tōṟṟatu meyyē.

**English translation of verse 6.6.6:**

My tender daughter, with bow-like brows lovely, has lost control  
Over her body, buried in [meditation](/definition/meditation#history "show meditation definitions") of the Lord, sweet to behold.  
With shoulders many, like an orchard and arms like lotus, in fresh bloom,  
Wearing the crown lovely which does like a [gold](/definition/gold#history "show gold definitions") mount gleam.

#### Note

\(i\) The loss of control over the body denotes the Nāyakī’s state of ecstasy, when she is entirely beside herself. It is indeed a remarkable irony that the Nāyakī, from whom the Lord cannot bear being apart even for a split second, should get lost in meditation of the exquisite form of the Lord, whereas [Sita](/definition/sita#vaishnavism "show Sita definitions") said, as reported by [Hanumān](/definition/hanuman#vaishnavism "show Hanumān definitions"), that she could wait for a month for her reclamation by [Rāma](/definition/rama#vaishnavism "show Rāma definitions").

\(ii\) The Nāyakī’s brow has the reputation of making the Lord turn His attention in the direction of her glance, as indicated by the twist of her brow. This ensures the influx of the Lord’s grace on all those associated with the [Āḻvār](/definition/aḻvar#vaishnavism "show Āḻvār definitions").
