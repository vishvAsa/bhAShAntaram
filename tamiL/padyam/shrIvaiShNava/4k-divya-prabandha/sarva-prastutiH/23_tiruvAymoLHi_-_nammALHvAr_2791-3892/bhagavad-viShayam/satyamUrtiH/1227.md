**[Tamil](/definition/tamil#history "show Tamil definitions") text and transliteration:**

நாகத்து அணையானை நாள்தோறும் ஞானத்தால்  
ஆகத்தணைப் பார்க்கு அருள்செய்யும் அம்மானை  
மாகத்து இளமதியம் சேரும் சடையானைப்  
பாகத்து வைத்தான் தன் பாதம் பணிந்தேனே.

nākattu aṇaiyāṉai nāḷtōṟum ñāṉattāl  
ākattaṇaip pārkku aruḷceyyum ammāṉai  
mākattu iḷamatiyam cērum caṭaiyāṉaip  
pākattu vaittāṉ taṉ pātam paṇintēṉē.

**English translation of verse 10.4.6:**

Blest am I to adore the feet of the Lord,  
Who keeps, on one side of His body, him that sports  
On matted locks the crescent Moon, the Sire great,  
Who sheds for ever His grace on those  
Whose knowledge blooms into love that does embrace,  
In their hearts, Him that does on [serpent](/definition/serpent#history "show serpent definitions")-bed repose.

**Notes:**

\(i\) What is emphasised here by the [Āḻvār](/definition/aḻvar#vaishnavism "show Āḻvār definitions") is the need for transforming one’s knowledge of God into love for Him. Knowledge of God is wisdom’s root while love of God is its ripest fruit. In His Song Celestial also, Lord [Kṛṣṇa](/definition/krishna#vaishnavism "show Kṛṣṇa definitions") insists on loving [meditation](/definition/meditation#history "show meditation definitions"). Of-course, He sedulously nurtures the God-love of the devotees to the point of fruition. It would be futile to expect our wandering minds to get fixed on the Lord, all the time, unless His grace alights on us at His sweet volition.

\(ii\) The tender solicitude of the Lord is indicated here, by pointing out how He has assigned a part of His body to [Śiva](/definition/shiva#vaishnavism "show Śiva definitions"), who is donning the crescent Moon on malted locks.
