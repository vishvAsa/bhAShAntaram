**[Tamil](/definition/tamil#history "show Tamil definitions") text and transliteration:**

கண் ஆவான் என்றும், மண்ணோர் விண்ணோர்க்கு,  
தண் ஆர் வேங்கட, விண்ணோர் வெற்பனே.

kaṇ āvāṉ eṉṟum, maṇṇōr viṇṇōrkku,  
taṇ ār vēṅkaṭa, viṇṇōr veṟpaṉē.

**English translation of verse 1.8.3:**

The Lord who is like unto a pair of eyes  
For those on Earth and [Heaven](/definition/heaven#history "show Heaven definitions"),  
Stays in [Vēṅkaṭam](/definition/venkatam#vaishnavism "show Vēṅkaṭam definitions"), cool and nice.  
The Celestials’ favourite haven.

**Note**

Like unto the mother of twins lying in between her two kids, the Lord stays in Tiruvēṅkaṭam (in [Andhra](/definition/andhra#history "show Andhra definitions") Pradesh), the [meeting](/definition/meeting#history "show meeting definitions") ground of the Earthlings and the Celestials. The [Āḻvār](/definition/aḻvar#vaishnavism "show Āḻvār definitions") even goes to the extent of calling this glorious hilly retreat as the home of the Celestials, on the ground that the Celestials visiting it far exceed the number of the earthly visitors. Actually, it is the amazing simplicity of the Supreme Lord, making Himself easily accessible even to the monkeys and hunters around this sacred spot, that drags the celestials on to this centre. It is reverently held by our elders that the fauna and flora on the sacred Hills are but Celestials transplanted there.
