**English translation of verse 1.1.10:**

The foregoing ten stanzas, out of the thousand, [rich](/definition/rich#history "show rich definitions") alike in sound and substance (matter and manner of expression), sung by Caṭakōpaṉ of [Kurukūr](/definition/kurukur#vaishnavism "show Kurukūr definitions"), in adoration of the Glorious Feet of the Supreme Lord, the great Contriver and Controller of the five elements, the spatial ether, air, fire, water and earth, with their respective basic qualities of sound, force, heat, chillness and endurance, shall lead (the chanters on) to ‘[Mōkṣa](/definition/moksha#vaishnavism "show Mōkṣa definitions")’ (final emancipation from the [bondage](/definition/bondage#history "show bondage definitions") of ‘[Saṃsāra](/definition/samsara#history "show Saṃsāra definitions")’, the terrific cycle of [birth](/definition/birth#history "show birth definitions") and [death](/definition/death#history "show death definitions")).

**Notes**

\(i\) This sets the pattern of the entire work, the last stanza of each decad indicating the benefits accruing to one who chants the songs in the decad and/or learns the meanings thereof. One might wonder how the Saint could refer to the size of the work, as comprising, thousand stanzas right at the start. Well, there are two ways of looking at it, namely,

> (*a*) as one whose knowledge was fully inspired by God, he knew that > he would reel off a thousand stanzas; and >
> (*b*) the poet could not sustain himself except by > [singing](/definition/singing#history "show singing definitions") a > thousand songs in adoration of the Lord, and thus it was a matter > already contemplated by him, a resolution, as it were, to sing as many > songs.

\(ii\) Summing up, in this stanza, the decad as a whole, the Saint has made it abundantly clear that our [salvation](/definition/salvation#history "show salvation definitions") lies in seeking refuge at the Lord’s Feet, the path of loving surrender to God being the central theme of the whole work, otherwise known as ‘*[Dīrgha](/definition/dirgha#history "show Dīrgha definitions") [Śaraṇāgati](/definition/sharanagati#vaishnavism "show Śaraṇāgati definitions")*’. Actually, the first decad is the epitome of the entire hymnal, even as the first three stanzas of this, decad sum up the topic of the whole decad while the-first stanza is the quintessence of the first three stanzas and the opening Jine of the first stanza, the; brilliant summary thereof.
