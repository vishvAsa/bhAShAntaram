**English translation of verse 9.6.2:**

Oh, Sire, residing in Teṉkāṭkarai, with many a pond and orchard fine,  
As I dote on Your traits auspicious that steal sway my sins,  
My heart gives way and when to utter Your glory I begin,  
Melts down my mind, my soul would with passion [burn](/definition/burning#history "show burn definitions")  
If I your praise did sing, serve You I know not how I can.

**Notes:**

The Lord’s tender solicitude for the [Āḻvār](/definition/aḻvar#vaishnavism "show Āḻvār definitions"), His amazing simplicity and astounding love, exhibited in VIII-7, made it appear that the Āḻvār was His sole concern and He literally doted on him. In trying to recollect, in this decad, the extra-ordinary posture of the Lord, the Āḻvār only finds that he is attempting the impossible. His mind was not equal to the task, giving way right at the beginning, like unto the embankment of the river, swept off by the flood waters, leaving no trace of its former existence. Even when the mind is not active and virtually defunct, the tongue would utter the Lord’s glory mechanically and these words, trickling down the ears to the region of the heart, would only corrode it still further and disintegrate it. How then could the Āḻvār think of serving the Lord, especially when he is struck dumb and insensate, ruminating over the Lord’s erstwhile utterance unto him, “Thee, I shall serve”, reversing the normal order of things?
