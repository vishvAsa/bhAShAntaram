**English translation of verse 8.1.5:**

You are my [life](/definition/life#history "show life definitions") dear, oh Lord! You did create  
The spacious worlds, one and all, pulled them out  
From beneath the waters deep, during the [deluge](/definition/deluge#history "show deluge definitions") ate  
And later spat them out, the Supreme Lord that You are,  
You spanned the worlds, reposed on the vast sheet of water,  
Churned the ocean once, then bunded it and broke the bund later;  
Could You unto [Devas](/definition/deva#vaishnavism "show Devas definitions") be what they are unto men, oh, great One,  
You, the unique Soul of all the worlds, where shall I attain?

**Notes:**

\(i\) In the preceding song, the [Āḻvār](/definition/aḻvar#vaishnavism "show Āḻvār definitions") would appear to have provoked the Lord into questioning him, how one, so ill-equipped as he, could think of attaining Him and on the top of that, [doubt](/definition/doubt#history "show doubt definitions") His greatness and bonafides. The Āḻvār’s answer is that he is but the body and the Lord, the life within, whose bounden duty it is to take care of him. There was hardly any question of the body [pursuing](/definition/pursuing#history "show pursuing definitions") a path of its own, by way of [practising](/definition/practising#history "show practising definitions") austerity, discipline etc. Actually, it was He who did, from time to time, all that had to be done, by way of creating the worlds, sustaining them within His stomach during the deluge, refunding them later on to their former sistuations [situations?], rescuing the worlds from [Mahā](/definition/maha#history "show Mahā definitions") [Bali](/definition/bali#vaishnavism "show Bali definitions"), the usurper, by spanning them all, in just three strides, so on and so forth. And then, He lay on the ocean where came the Divine Mother through His churning; He also bunded the ocean to cross over to Laṇkā, to get at the Mother and later demolished the bund, so as to prevent the entry of the [Rākṣasas](/definition/rakshasa#vaishnavism "show Rākṣasas definitions") into the mainland.

\(ii\) The humans could subsist on mere [food](/definition/food#history "show food definitions") and water while the Devas need ‘[Amrut](/definition/amrut#vaishnavism "show Amrut definitions") [[Amṛta](/definition/amrita#vaishnavism "show Amṛta definitions")]’ (ambrosia) for their subsistence. If this marks the distance between the mortals and the immortal Devas, well, there is not only that much distance but very much more between the Devas and the Supreme Lord, the ‘Devādi [Deva](/definition/deva#vaishnavism "show Deva definitions")’ and the comparison is thus not on all fours. While the ratio between Man and Deva is a definite quantum, that between the Deva and the Lord would baffle even the wildest imagination and cannot be put in finite terms.
