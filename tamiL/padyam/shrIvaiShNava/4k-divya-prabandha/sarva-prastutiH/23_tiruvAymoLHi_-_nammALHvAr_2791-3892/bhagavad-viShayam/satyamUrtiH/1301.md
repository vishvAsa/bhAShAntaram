மாயம்செய்யேல் என்னை உன்திருமார்வத்து மாலைநங்கை  
வாசம்செய் பூங்குழலாள் திருஆணை நின்ஆணை கண்டாய்  
நேசம்செய்து உன்னோடு என்னை உயிர் வேறுஇன்றி ஒன்றாகவே  
கூசம்செய்யாது கொண்டாய் என்னைக்கூவிக் கொள்ளாய் வந்துஅந்தோ!

māyamceyyēl eṉṉai uṉtirumārvattu mālainaṅkai  
vācamcey pūṅkuḻalāḷ tiruāṇai niṉāṇai kaṇṭāy  
nēcamceytu uṉṉōṭu eṉṉai uyir vēṟuiṉṟi oṉṟākavē  
kūcamceyyātu koṇṭāy eṉṉaikkūvik koḷḷāy vantuantō!

**English translation of verse 10.10.2:**

On oath do I put Your Consort Divine,  
That perfect lady whose locks emit fragrance fine,  
Like unto the garland You do on Your lovely chest don;  
I put You also on oath, You did court me on Your own  
And mingled with me freely as if You and I were one;  
Play You [shan](/definition/shan#history "show shan definitions")’t Your wily pranks on me any more  
But call me up to Your lovely feet, delaying no more.

**Notes:**

There was no immediate response to the [Āḻvār](/definition/aḻvar#vaishnavism "show Āḻvār definitions")’s call, as in the last song. And so, he repeats that the Lord should not side-track him and keep him in [bondage](/definition/bondage#history "show bondage definitions"), as hitherto, on one pretext or another. The Āḻvār’s yearning is so deep that he even binds the Lord and His consort, the Divine Mother, irresistibly upon oath, to fulfil his longing, too deep for words. When the Lord turned round and called the Āḻvār’s attention to the impropriety of his binding Him on oath, [cutting](/definition/cutting#history "show cutting definitions") at the root his essential [nature](/definition/nature#history "show nature definitions") of total dependence on Him as His exclusive vassal, the Āḻvār justifies his stance quite well: The Lord mingled freely with him and loved him even more than His Consort, [Mahā-lakṣmī](/definition/mahalakshmi#vaishnavism "show Mahā-lakṣmī definitions"), completely identifying Himself with him. The up-surge of love unto Him, thus generated in the Āḻvār, grew intense beyond words and it was the exuberance of this love that induced the Āḻvār to move to such incredible lengths for sheer survival through speedy restoration to Him.
