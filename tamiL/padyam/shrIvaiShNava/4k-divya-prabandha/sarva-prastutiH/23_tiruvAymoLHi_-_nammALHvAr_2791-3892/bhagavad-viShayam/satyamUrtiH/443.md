பெய்வளைக் கைகளைக் கூப்பி 'பிரான்கிடக்கும் கடல்' என்னும்,  
செய்யது ஓர் ஞாயிற்றைக் காட்டி, 'சிரீதரன் மூர்த்தி ஈது என்னும்,  
நையும் கண்ணீர் மல்க நின்று 'நாரணன்' என்னும் அன்னே, என்  
தெய்வ உருவில் சிறுமான் செய்கின்றது ஒன்று அறியேனே.

teyva uruvil ciṟumāṉ ceykiṉṟatu oṉṟu aṟiyēṉē.

**English translation of verse 4.4.2:**

Ha! comprehend I can’t the actions of my daughter,  
Angelic little one, reverently joining her hands decked with bangles  
And looking at the ocean as where reposes her great Benefactor;  
Pointing to the Sun with red sheen peerless, she tells  
That is just the complexion of Cirītaraṉ; flooded with [tears](/definition/tear#history "show tears definitions")  
In her languishing eyes, the word Nāraṇaṉ, she always utters.

**Note**

It is because Parāṅkuśa Nāyakī keeps meditating on her Lord of oceanic hue that the bangles could be sustained on her wrists, despite her separation from her beloved. It is now night and nothing is visible. The pensive Nāyakī with joined palms, however, hears the roaring [noise](/definition/noise#history "show noise definitions") of the oceanic waves and instantly envisions her Lord of oceanic hue, with her mind’s eye, and says, it is the place where her Lord reposes. It could also be that she was recalling [Śrī Rāma](/definition/shrirama#history "show Śrī Rāma definitions") languishing before the ocean, without [food](/definition/food#history "show food definitions"), in order to get at [Sītā](/definition/sita#vaishnavism "show Sītā definitions").

And now, the Sun has risen and there is the visible Sun, unlike the ocean which she could only muse upon the previous night, without actually seeing it. The Sun reminds the Nāyakī of the conjunction of the Lord and [Lakṣmī](/definition/lakshmi#vaishnavism "show Lakṣmī definitions"), like unto the combination of the gem and its lustre. Did not [Sitā](/definition/sita#vaishnavism "show Sitā definitions") tell [Rāvaṇa](/definition/ravana#vaishnavism "show Rāvaṇa definitions") that she was but the sheen of [Rāma](/definition/rama#vaishnavism "show Rāma definitions"), the Sun and that she could not be separated from Śrī Rāma? Śrī Rāma also echoed the same sentiment, later on. The Nāyakī is too feeble to mouth the word ‘Nārāyaṇaṉ’, in full and merely mutters the incomplete word ‘Nāraṇaṉ’.
