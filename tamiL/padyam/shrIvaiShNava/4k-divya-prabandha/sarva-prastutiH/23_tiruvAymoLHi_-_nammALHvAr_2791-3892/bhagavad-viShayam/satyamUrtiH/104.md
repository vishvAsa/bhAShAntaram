**[Tamil](/definition/tamil#history "show Tamil definitions") text and transliteration:**

ஆனான் ஆன் ஆயன், மீனோடேனமும்;  
தான் ஆனான் என்னில், தானாயசங்கே.

āṉāṉ āṉ āyaṉ, mīṉōṭēṉamum;  
tāṉ āṉāṉ eṉṉil, tāṉāyacaṅkē.

**English translation of verse 1.8.8:**

Myriads are the Lord’s incarnations;  
As the Cowherd He came down,  
[Fish](/definition/fish#history "show Fish definitions"), [Boar](/definition/boar#history "show Boar definitions") and many other forms  
He took, just to get hold of me.

**Note**

The [Āḻvār](/definition/aḻvar#vaishnavism "show Āḻvār definitions") feels that the innumerable Avatāras of the Lord were all for his delectation, mainly directed towards getting hold of him and uniting with him.
