**[Tamil](/definition/tamil#history "show Tamil definitions") text and transliteration:**

பலபலவே ஆபரணம் பேரும் பலபலவே,  
பலபலவே சோதி வடிவு பண்பு எண்ணில்,  
பலபல கண்டு உண்டு கேட்டு உற்று மோந்து இன்பம்,  
பலபலவே ஞானமும் பாம்பு அணை மேலாற்கேயோ.

palapalavē āparaṇam pērum palapalavē,  
palapalavē cōti vaṭivu [paṇpu](/definition/panpu#history "show paṇpu definitions") eṇṇil,  
palapala kaṇṭu uṇṭu kēṭṭu uṟṟu mōntu iṉpam,  
palapalavē ñāṉamum pāmpu aṇai mēlāṟkēyō.

**English translation of verse 2.5.6:**

The Lord who on [serpent](/definition/serpent#history "show serpent definitions") bed reclines,  
(Has acquired inside me dimensions new);  
Were I to pause and examine His union  
With me, an endless variety unto me He unravels,  
Of [jewels](/definition/jewel#history "show jewels definitions"), Forms exquisite and how in me He revels  
[Thro](/definition/thro#history "show Thro definitions")’ the sensual channels many with appropriate Know-how.

**Notes**

\(i\) The [Āḻvār](/definition/aḻvar#vaishnavism "show Āḻvār definitions") feels that the Lord, in union with him, is not satisfied with His assumption of a single form, a single set of jewels, a single method of enjoyment of the Āḻvār through the senses of seeing, smelling etc, or single type of knowledge bin wants to enjoy the Āḻvār in myriad ways, employing different techniques, assuming different forms, displaying different sets of jewels, so on and so forth.

\(ii\) As Nampiḷḷai puts it, the Lord wants to enjoy the Āḻvār, assuming many forms, as Sage Śaubhari did, with regard to his umpteen wives. The Lord exhibits the same ardour iṇ His enjoyment of the Āḻvār as the emancipated soul does, on reaching [Heaven](/definition/heaven#history "show Heaven definitions"), for [enjoying](/definition/enjoying#history "show enjoying definitions") the Lord.
