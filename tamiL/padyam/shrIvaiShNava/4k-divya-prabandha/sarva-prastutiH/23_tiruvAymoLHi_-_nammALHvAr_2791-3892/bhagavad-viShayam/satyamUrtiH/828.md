**English translation of verse 7.4.4:**

Oh, how wonderful! the Lord did during [deluge](/definition/deluge#history "show deluge definitions") sustain  
In His stomach which with [noise](/definition/noise#history "show noise definitions") great sucked in  
The worlds seven, the sky and the planets tumbling down.  
Land and water got uprooted and Time ceased to function.  
The wind and fire, the mountains seven,  
The stars and other luminaries fell off their position.

**Notes:**

This song brings out the extraordinary situation that prevailed at the time of the deluge when all the elements, Sky and Earth, the Sun, Stars and other luminous bodies fell from their respective positions and moved into the Lord’s stomach, literally sucked in, to avoid being swept off. When the Sun, the chief indicater of time and its numerous components got dislodged, Time automatically ceased to function. Here then is a state of terrible impasse but all things are quite safe inside the Lord’s stomach. Oh, what a miracle!
