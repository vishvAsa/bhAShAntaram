**[Tamil](/definition/tamil#history "show Tamil definitions") text and transliteration:**

யானே என்னை அறியகிலாதே,  
யானே என் தனதே என்று இருந்தேன்,  
யானே நீ என் உடைமையும் நீயே,  
வானே ஏத்தும் எம் வானவர் ஏறே

yāṉē eṉṉai aṟiyakilātē,  
yāṉē eṉ taṉatē eṉṟu iruntēṉ,  
yāṉē nī eṉ uṭaimaiyum nīyē,  
vāṉē ēttum em vāṉavar ēṟē

**English translation of verse 2.9.9:**

Oh, my Lord, by the entire [heaven](/definition/heaven#history "show heaven definitions") adored!  
Chief of Celestials, Fancied I, in ignorance bred,  
I my master was and all things mine own;  
But now do I realise, all are yours, I and mine.

**Note**

The Lord had done His best, down the ages, to reclaim the [Āḻvār](/definition/aḻvar#vaishnavism "show Āḻvār definitions") but the latter was striking a divergent path all the time, not knowing his essential [nature](/definition/nature#history "show nature definitions") and relationship with God. Prior to his reclamation, the Āḻvār was like unto a Prince, fallen into the hands of a hunter and brought up like the hunter’s son in strange environments, totally alien to his native surroundings. But now true knowledge has dawned on him and he is in a position to advise the people around to disengage themselves from the erroneous notions of ‘I’ and ‘Mine’ and be rooted in the Lord, whose exclusive vassals they are, solely dependent on Him.
