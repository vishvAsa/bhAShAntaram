**[Tamil](/definition/tamil#history "show Tamil definitions") text and transliteration:**

மாய்ந்துஅறும் வினைகள்தாமே மாதவா என்ன நாளும்-  
ஏய்ந்தபொன் மதிள் அனந்தபுர நகர்எந்தைக்குஎன்று  
சாந்தொடு விளக்கம்தூபம் தாமரை மலர்கள்நல்ல  
ஆய்ந்துகொண்டு ஏத்தவல்லார் அந்தம்இல் புகழினாரே.

cāntoṭu viḷakkamtūpam tāmarai malarkaḷnalla  
āyntukoṇṭu ēttavallār antamil pukaḻiṉārē.

**English translation of verse 10.2.10:**

All your sins will go off, on their own, when you utter  
The name ‘Mātavaṉ’; undying fame shall in them vest that offer  
With ardour great, fine sandal paste, [lamp](/definition/lamp#history "show lamp definitions") and [incense](/definition/incense#history "show incense definitions") and gather  
Lotus flowers nice, for the diurnal worship of the Lord  
At holy [Aṉantapuram](/definition/anantapuram#vaishnavism "show Aṉantapuram definitions"), the city bounded by [walls](/definition/wall#history "show walls definitions") of solid [gold](/definition/gold#history "show gold definitions").

**Notes:**

\(i\) The name, ‘Mātavaṉ’, ([Mādhava](/definition/madhava#vaishnavism "show Mādhava definitions")) denotes the Lord, in conjunction with [Mahālakṣmī](/definition/mahalakshmi#vaishnavism "show Mahālakṣmī definitions"), the Divine Mother and it is but natural that all our miseries die off, when we ejaculate the Lord’s name, betokening this highly benevolent combination of our eternal Father and Mother.

\(ii\) Serving the Lord with due ceremonies and [worshipping](/definition/worshipping#history "show worshipping definitions") Him uninterruptedly, free from distractions, in the High [Heavens](/definition/heaven#history "show Heavens definitions"), is by-no-means a matter of surprise, because that is the land of unalloyed bliss and beatitude, rid of all impediments to the continual [meditation](/definition/meditation#history "show meditation definitions") and worship of the Lord. Unlike the denizens of the High Heavens, who hold an unbroken rapport with the Lord, the inexhaustible fountain of bliss, here, in this land of darkness and nescience, with its numerous distractions, if there are at least some who procure, with great care and devotion, choice materials with which to worship the Lord in His worshippable Form, it is indeed a matter for great surprise; surely, these are men of undying fame, indeed.
