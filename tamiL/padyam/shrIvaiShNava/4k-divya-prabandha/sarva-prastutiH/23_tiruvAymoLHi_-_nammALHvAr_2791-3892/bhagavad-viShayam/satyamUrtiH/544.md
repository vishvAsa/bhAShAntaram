**[Tamil](/definition/tamil#history "show Tamil definitions") text and transliteration:**

ஆனான் ஆளுடையான் என்று அஃதே கொண்டு உகந்துவந்து  
தானே இன்அருள் செய்து என்னை முற்றவும் தான் ஆனான்,  
மீன் ஆய் ஆமையும் ஆய் நரசிங்கமும் ஆய் குறள் ஆய்,  
கான் ஆர் ஏனமும் ஆய் கற்கி ஆம் இன்னம் கார் வண்ணனே.

āṉāṉ āḷuṭaiyāṉ eṉṟu aḵtē koṇṭu ukantuvantu  
tāṉē iṉaruḷ ceytu eṉṉai muṟṟavum tāṉ āṉāṉ,  
mīṉ āy āmaiyum āy naraciṅkamum āy kuṟaḷ āy,  
kāṉ ār ēṉamum āy kaṟki ām iṉṉam kār vaṇṇaṉē.

**English translation of verse 5.1.10:**

That the [cloud](/definition/cloud#history "show cloud definitions")-hued Lord has me His vassal made  
I gratefully uttered and He has His grace on me shed  
Most lovingly and unto me become everything delicious;  
He is the One who did incarnate as [Fish](/definition/fish#history "show Fish definitions"), [Wild Boar](/definition/wild-boar#history "show Wild Boar definitions"), Tortoise,  
Man-[Lion](/definition/lion#history "show Lion definitions") and Midget and will, as [Kalki](/definition/kalki#vaishnavism "show Kalki definitions"), appear in due course.

#### Note

The age-long efforts of the Lord, an indefatigable cultivator, to redeem and reclaim the [Āḻvār](/definition/aḻvar#vaishnavism "show Āḻvār definitions"), have, at long last, yielded results. The Āḻvār who is now God-bent, gratefully acknowledges the Lord’s herculean efforts. And this simple gesture of the Āḻvār has drawn the Lord inside him, where He lovingly stays, firm and fast. This is, however, nothing new for the Lord who spared no pains in the process of sustentation and incarnated in various forms. Even as the [clouds](/definition/cloud#history "show clouds definitions") go on unleashing the rains, the cloud-hued Lord will not stop with the many incarnations already made by Him; He will also incarnate as Kalki hereafter. Looking at all the past incarnations of the Lord as those solely directed towards the Āḻvār’s reclamation, His future [Avatāra](/definition/avatara#vaishnavism "show Avatāra definitions") as ‘Kalki’ would seem to be superfluous but it is not so, being intended as a safeguard or corrective against the possible future pit-falls, as long as the Āḻvār remains in this abode.
