வம்மின் புலவீர்! நும் மெய் வருத்திக் கைசெய்து உய்ம்மினோ,  
இம் மன் உலகினில் செல்வர் இப்போது இல்லை நோக்கினோம்,  
நும் இன் கவி கொண்டு நும் நும் இட்டா தெய்வம் ஏத்தினால்,  
செம் மின் சுடர் முடி என் திருமாலுக்குச் சேருமே.

vammiṉ pulavīr! num mey varuttik kaiceytu uymmiṉō,  
im maṉ ulakiṉil celvar ippōtu illai nōkkiṉōm,  
num iṉ [kavi](/definition/kavi#vaishnavism "show kavi definitions") koṇṭu num num iṭṭā teyvam ēttiṉāl,  
cem miṉ cuṭar muṭi eṉ tirumālukkuc cērumē.

**English translation of verse 3.9.6:**

Come, ye, potts, give up eulogising the humans,  
There’s none in this land big, as I now examine,  
Wealthy enough to reward you well for your hymns;  
‘Tis but meet, you shall, by the sweat of your brow, earn;  
If you praise the deity of your heart, even then,  
Those promises shall reach my Tirumāl, with lustrous crown.

**Notes**

\(i\) *Come, Ye, poets*: The [Āḻvār](/definition/aḻvar#vaishnavism "show Āḻvār definitions") beckons the poets in the same way as a person invites persons caught up in a [forest](/definition/forest#history "show forest definitions") fire to come and have a dip in a pond full of water, cool and deep. The poets, however, submit that they have

to eke out their livelihood by lauding the humans. The Āḻvār emphasises that they should not debase their talents and they might as well earn by physical [labour](/definition/labour#history "show labour definitions"). But then, the poets, not accustomed to bodily exertion, make out that [composing](/definition/composing#history "show composing definitions") [poems](/definition/poem#history "show poems definitions") was the easier of the two and that they should, therefore, be allowed to pursue their normal avocation. The Āḻvār does not, however, mince matters and tightly points out that there is none in this world wealthy enough to reward their talents suitably and that they should not undetsell themselves.

\(ii\) *If you praise the Deity of your heart*: If you say that even if there be no wealthy person among the humans, [Indra](/definition/indra#vaishnavism "show Indra definitions") and other [Devas](/definition/deva#vaishnavism "show Devas definitions") could be considered wealthy and you would, therefore, compose poems [singing](/definition/singing#history "show singing definitions") their glory, well, whatever praise you [heap](/definition/heap#history "show heap definitions") on them will actually reach ‘Tirumāl’ (Lord [Viṣṇu](/definition/vishnu#vaishnavism "show Viṣṇu definitions")), as their Internal Controller, rather, it will be more appropriate to Him, being the one really praiseworthy. And, therefore, you had better praise the Supreme Lord, straightaway, instead of passing through intermediaries.
