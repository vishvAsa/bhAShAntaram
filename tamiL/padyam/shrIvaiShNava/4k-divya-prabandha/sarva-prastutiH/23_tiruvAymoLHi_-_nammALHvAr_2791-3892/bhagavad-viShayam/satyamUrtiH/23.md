**[Tamil](/definition/tamil#history "show Tamil definitions") text and transliteration:**

அற்றது பற்று எனில் உற்றது வீடு உயிர்  
செற்ற அது மன் உறில் அற்று இறை பற்றே.

aṟṟatu paṟṟu eṉil uṟṟatu vīṭu uyir  
ceṟṟa atu maṉ uṟil aṟṟu [iṟai](/definition/iṟai#history "show iṟai definitions") paṟṟē.

**English translation of verse 1.2.5:**

Freed from worldly attachments, the Soul attains emancipation [from the erstwhile [bondage](/definition/bondage#history "show bondage definitions")]; however, shunning that [menacing state of self-enjoyment, known as *[kaivalya](/definition/kaivalya#vaishnavism "show kaivalya definitions") [mokṣa](/definition/moksha#vaishnavism "show mokṣa definitions")*], seek firmly the [bliss of eternal service to the Supreme] Lord, with exclusive devotion unto Him.

**Note**

Mere liberation from bondage resulting in a state of the lustrous soul getting lost in self-enjoyment (*kaivalya mokṣa*) is yet another hurdle, very menacing indeed, to be got over, being a serious impediment to the far superior and blissful experience of service unto the Lord on the yonder side of [heaven](/definition/heaven#history "show heaven definitions"), this ‘*kaivalya*’ state also deserves to be shunned and discarded.
