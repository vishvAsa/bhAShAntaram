ஒன்பதோடு ஒன்றுக்கும் மூவுலகும் உருகுமே (2)

**English translation of verse 9.5.11:**

Listeners, in all three worlds, of these songs nine plus one,  
Out of the thousand of [Kurukūr](/definition/kurukur#vaishnavism "show Kurukūr definitions") Caṭakōpaṉ,  
Adoring the Lord, Who the eternal bliss confers, pervading all over,  
And did on him His grace sweet shower,  
That he might His praise sing till the end of eternity.  
Will surely thaw down, however hard-hearted they might be.

**Notes:**

It may be recalled that, in the end song of VI-8 also, the benefit accrued by dint of chanting that decad was said to be the acquisition of the rare virtue of melting tenderness of heart, making it thaw down like the minute sands in water springs. It is indeed the Lord’s grace galore that enables His devotees to sing His inexhaustible glory for aḷl time. Even among these ten songs, the tenth stands on a special footing and is of unique grandeur. That is why the text of this song refers to the ten stanzas, in this decad, as the sum of nine and one, bringing out the grandeur of one stanza *vis-a-vis* the other nine. In the first nine songs, we saw the Nāyakī struggling to sustain herself through her association with things and creatures bearing the Lord’s likeness, while in the tenth, she felt as though [life](/definition/life#history "show life definitions") was extinct and what remained was the mere body, ready to fall off.
