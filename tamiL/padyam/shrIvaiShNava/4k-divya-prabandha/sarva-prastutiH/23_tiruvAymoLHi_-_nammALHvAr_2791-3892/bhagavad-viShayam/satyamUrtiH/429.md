**[Tamil](/definition/tamil#history "show Tamil definitions") text and transliteration:**

கோவை வாயாள் பொருட்டு ஏற்றின் எருத்தம் இறுத்தாய், மதிள் இலங்கைக்  
கோவை வீயச் சிலை குனித்தாய்! குல நல் யானை மருப்பு ஒசித்தாய்,  
பூவை வீயா நீர் தூவிப் போதால் வணங்கேனேலும், நின்  
பூவை வீயாம் மேனிக்குப் பூசும் சாந்து என் நெஞ்சமே.

kōvai vāyāḷ poruṭṭu ēṟṟiṉ eruttam iṟuttāy, matiḷ ilaṅkaik  
kōvai vīyac cilai kuṉittāy! [kula](/definition/kula#history "show kula definitions") nal yāṉai maruppu ocittāy,  
pūvai vīyā nīr tūvip pōtāl vaṇaṅkēṉēlum, niṉ  
pūvai vīyām mēṉikkup pūcum cāntu eṉ neñcamē.

**English translation of verse 4.3.1:**

Oh, Lord, You broke the hump of the [bulls](/definition/bull#history "show bulls definitions") truly  
And secured (Nappiṉṉai), the red-lipped beauty;  
The [king](/definition/king#history "show king definitions") of [Laṅkā](/definition/lanka#vaishnavism "show Laṅkā definitions"), with ramparts high, you [killed](/definition/killing#history "show killed definitions")  
With Your bow infallible and out you pulled  
The tusk fine of that majestic [elephant](/definition/elephant#history "show elephant definitions") and slew it;  
At these crucial moments, I served you not in manner fit,  
With flowers fine and water pure and yet  
My mind is the sandal paste fit for your lovely body of lily tint.

**Notes**

\(i\) The [Āḻvār](/definition/aḻvar#vaishnavism "show Āḻvār definitions") regrets that he wasn’t keeping himself close to the Lord, when He tamed the unruly bulls for winning the hand of Nappiṉṉai, the charming bride, when he slew [Rāvaṇa](/definition/ravana#vaishnavism "show Rāvaṇa definitions"), the king of Laṅkā and killed Kuvalayāpīḍa, the high class elephant, set on Him by the treacherous [Kaṃsa](/definition/kamsa#vaishnavism "show Kaṃsa definitions"), by [crushing](/definition/crushing#history "show crushing definitions") its tusks. Had he (Āḻvār) been by the side of the Lord on those occasions, he could have tended Him well and relieved Him of the fatigue. Despite this lapse on his part, the Āḻvār wonders how the Lord looks upon his mind, with great delight, as if it was aromatic like high class sandal paste, fit for anointing His exquisite body.

\(ii\) Had the Āḻvār been by the side of Lord [Kṛṣṇa](/definition/krishna#vaishnavism "show Kṛṣṇa definitions") when He pounced upon the unruly bulls, he could have cautioned Him that they were not bulls, as such, but demons in disguise, even as [Lakṣmaṇa](/definition/lakshmana#vaishnavism "show Lakṣmaṇa definitions"), pointed out to [Śrī Rāma](/definition/shrirama#history "show Śrī Rāma definitions"), that the deer, coveted by [Sītā](/definition/sita#vaishnavism "show Sītā definitions"), was but a [Rākṣasa](/definition/rakshasa#vaishnavism "show Rākṣasa definitions") in disguise.

\(iii\) There is no greater security for us than the Lord and yet, Rāvaṇa relied on his forts and moats, and Kaṃsa, on Kuvalayāpīḍa, the mighty tusker and the like and little wonder then, they all came to grief.
