**English translation of verse 9.3.2:**

‘Tis He Who did ordain the spacious Universe  
And pulled it out from beneath the deep waters

‘Tis He Who the said Universe did gulp once,  
Then spat and spanned; he ([Brahmā](/definition/brahma#vaishnavism "show Brahmā definitions")), he ([Śiva](/definition/shiva#vaishnavism "show Śiva definitions")) and he ([Indra](/definition/indra#vaishnavism "show Indra definitions")), He is,  
And all other things and beings, He is besides;  
[This] we learn ([thro](/definition/thro#history "show thro definitions")’ knowledge by Him bestowed).

**Notes:**

The Supreme Lord, as the great Ordainer of the Universe, combines in Himself all the three causes of creation, the material, the operative and the instrumental. He is also ṭhe Universal Saviour Who sustained the Universe inside His stomach, during the [deluge](/definition/deluge#history "show deluge definitions"), rescued it from the oceanic depths after encountering the formidable [Hiraṇyākṣa](/definition/hiranyaksha#vaishnavism "show Hiraṇyākṣa definitions"), the [golden](/definition/gold#history "show golden definitions")-eyed demon and so on. The lands expropriated by the powerful Mahābali were reclaimed by the Lord by spanning all the worlds, in just three strides, and restored to the [Devās](/definition/deva#vaishnavism "show Devās definitions"). The Lord is the Internal Controller of one and all, without distinction of high and low; the original text of the song runs as “He is he, he and he....”, in the [Vedic](/definition/veda#vaishnavism "show Vedic definitions") pattern of ‘*Sa* [Brahmās](/definition/brahma#vaishnavism "show Brahmās definitions") *sa* [Śivas](/definition/shiva#vaishnavism "show Śivas definitions") *sa* [Indras](/definition/indra#vaishnavism "show Indras definitions") sokṣaraḥ Paramaśvarāṭ....” ([Puruṣa Sūkta](/definition/purusha-sukta#vaishnavism "show Puruṣa Sūkta definitions")). The pronoun ‘He’, occurring seven times, in the original text of this song, is indicated by ‘Saḥ’ (He) occuring in the above vedic text. The exalted Brahmā, Śiva, Indra and other Celestials as well as the ordinary denizens elsewhere are all dominated by the Lord, as their Internal Controller, a fact revealed to the [Āḻvār](/definition/aḻvar#vaishnavism "show Āḻvār definitions") by the Lord Himself, vide I-1-1.
