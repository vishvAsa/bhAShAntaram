Easy worshippability apart, the Lord should also be adorable.. We see around quite a few persons whom it is easy to please but we don’t like to court as there is nothing attractive or prepossessing in them. This decad shows that the Lord is highly adorable because of His extraordinary sweetness. As Nampiḷḷai would have it, the Lord is adorable to such an extent that He grows envious of His devotees and wants to adore them, in turn, having Himself tasted the sweetness of adoration. In [śloka](/definition/sloka#vaishnavism "show śloka definitions") ‘manujatva tiroitena.........’ of [Pādukā](/definition/paduka#history "show Pādukā definitions") Sahaśram, Śrī [Vedānta](/definition/vedanta#vaishnavism "show Vedānta definitions") [Deśika](/definition/desika#history "show Deśika definitions") observes that, unlike the previous [Avatāras](/definition/avatara#vaishnavism "show Avatāras definitions") when the Lord came all alone, He assumed four forms when He came down as [Śrī Rāma](/definition/shrirama#history "show Śrī Rāma definitions") and the three younger brothers. The purpose behind this was to adore His own pair of sandals which have a high reputation of their own. This He did in His other form as [Bharata](/definition/bharata#vaishnavism "show Bharata definitions"). Had [Rāma](/definition/rama#vaishnavism "show Rāma definitions") come alone, He couldn’t have achieved this purpose.
