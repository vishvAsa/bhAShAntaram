**[Tamil](/definition/tamil#history "show Tamil definitions") text and transliteration:**

கலக்கம் இல்லா நல்தவமுனிவர் கரைகண்டோர்  
துளக்கம் இல்லா வானவர் எல்லாம் தொழுவார்கள்  
மலக்கம் எய்த மாகடல்தன்னைக் கடைந்தானை  
உலக்க நாம் புகழ்கிற்பது என்செய்வது உரையீரே.

kalakkam illā naltavamuṉivar karaikaṇṭōr  
tuḷakkam illā vāṉavar ellām toḻuvārkaḷ  
malakkam eyta mākaṭaltaṉṉaik kaṭaintāṉai  
ulakka nām pukaḻkiṟpatu eṉceyvatu uraiyīrē.

**English translation of verse 8.3.10:**

There are the sages great with perfect clarity of mind,  
The released Souls and Eternal Heroes of [Heaven](/definition/heaven#history "show Heaven definitions") to attend  
And dote on the Lord, who the mighty ocean churned;  
Say then, if we frail beings can at all comprehend  
His glory great, seeing that unto it there is no end.

**Notes:**

It was only when the Lord finally brought home the fact, quite reassuring, that He was carefully attended upon by the most eminent sages like [Sanaka](/definition/sanaka#vaishnavism "show Sanaka definitions"), [Nandana](/definition/nandana#vaishnavism "show Nandana definitions") and others, the ‘[Muktas](/definition/mukta#vaishnavism "show Muktas definitions")’, released from the [bondage](/definition/bondage#history "show bondage definitions") of [samsāra](/definition/samsara#history "show samsāra definitions") and the ‘[Nityas](/definition/nitya#vaishnavism "show Nityas definitions")’, the Eternal Heroes in Heaven, and, above all, His own prowess unlimited, the [Āḻvār](/definition/aḻvar#vaishnavism "show Āḻvār definitions")’s fears were set at naught. But then, it might be asked whether this was not already known to the Āḻvār, endowed by the Lord with perfect knowledge. The love-intoxicated Āḻvār just didn’t know when and what could be the source of his anxiety about the Lord’s well-being and when and how such anxiety would get cleared, as the illustrious Nampiḷḷai would put it.
