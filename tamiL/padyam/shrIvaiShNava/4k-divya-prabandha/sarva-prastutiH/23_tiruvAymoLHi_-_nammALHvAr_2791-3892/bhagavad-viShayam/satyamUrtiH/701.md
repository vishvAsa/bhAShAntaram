**English translation of verse 6.4.9:**

By my tongue (love-inspired) I captivate the [cloud](/definition/cloud#history "show cloud definitions")-hued Lord  
Who the discus wields in right hand and the conch in His left,  
Who (as [Kṛṣṇa](/definition/krishna#vaishnavism "show Kṛṣṇa definitions")) drove to the regions afar, in a chariot deft,  
Across the seas seven, the mountains seven and the seven worlds  
And many such wonders did perform; equal unto me  
Could there, in all the land, any one be?

#### Notes

\(i\) The episode of Śrī Kṛṣṇa going in a chariot, along with a [Brahmin](/definition/brahmin#history "show Brahmin definitions") and [Arjuna](/definition/arjuna#vaishnavism "show Arjuna definitions"), to the ultra-mundane region and restoring to the Brahmin, his missing children, reclaimed from [Heaven](/definition/heaven#history "show Heaven definitions"), has been set forth, in detail, in the notes below III-10-5.

\(ii\) Saint [Nammāḻvār](/definition/nammalvar#vaishnavism "show Nammāḻvār definitions") is also known as Parāṅkuśa, the goad weaning round his spiritual antagonists through his scintillating hymns and making the Lord Himself pliable, enraptured by these sweet, love-laden hymns. The significance of this name has well been brought out. in this song. The discus and conch in the Lord’s hands typify ‘Time’ and ‘space’ or ‘infinity’ and ‘immensity’, respectively. As Śrī [Parāśara](/definition/parashara#history "show Parāśara definitions") Bhaṭṭar elucidated, while discoursing on this song, it is indeed impossible to enclose and entrap a God of this [nature](/definition/nature#history "show nature definitions"), but the prodigality of a Saint’s love does exceed these limits and encompasses even the Infinite. Verily, a God of ‘Space’ and ‘Time’ is like a wayward [Elephant](/definition/elephant#history "show Elephant definitions"), roaming at liberty, unrestrained and even such an  
Elephant, Saint Nammāḻvār, rather Parāṅkuśa, in this context, claims to curb and restrain. That is why he is significantly referring to the cloud-hued Lord along with His attributes, namely, ‘Discus’ and ‘Conch’.
