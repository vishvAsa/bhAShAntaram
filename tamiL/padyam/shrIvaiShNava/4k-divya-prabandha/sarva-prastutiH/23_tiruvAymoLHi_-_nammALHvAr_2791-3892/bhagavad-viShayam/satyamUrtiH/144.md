**[Tamil](/definition/tamil#history "show Tamil definitions") text and transliteration:**

தோற்றோம் மட நெஞ்சம் எம் பெருமான் நாரணற்கு எம்  
ஆற்றாமை சொல்லி அழுவோமை நீநடுவே,  
வேற்றோர் வகையில் கொடிதாய் எனை ஊழி,  
மாற்றாண்மை நிற்றியோ வாழி கனை இருளே.

**English translation of verse 2.1.7:**

We have unto Nāraṇaṉ, Our Lord  
Lost our hearts and we did our sorrows lament  
In each other’s [company](/definition/company#history "show company definitions") but step in you did,  
Worse than our foes you are, you darksome night!  
May you prosper and from this state be rid.

**Notes**

\(i\) This stanza, as worded above, does not accord with the pattern of the preceding and succeeding stanzas in this decad. Based, however, oṇ the diction as such, Emperumāṉar (Rāmānuja) and other [Ācāryas](/definition/acarya#vaishnavism "show Ācāryas definitions") were inclined to interpret this soṇg, as follows: The dark night, instead of [weeping](/definition/weeping#history "show weeping definitions") along with Parāṅkuśa Nāyakī and her comrades, is worse than a foe, in so far as it prevents their seeing each other and [bemoaning](/definition/bemoaning#history "show bemoaning definitions") their common lot of separation from the Lord.

\(ii\) There is, however, another method of interpreting this stanza, so as to bring it on a piece with the rest. Not knowing that darkness is an inherent quality of the night, Parāṅkuśa Nāyakī sympathises with it and exclaims, “We are already weighed down by our own calamity and here you are, exhibiting your own dire distress of darkness and adding to our miseries. May you soon be rid of this state and prosper!”
