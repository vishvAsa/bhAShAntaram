**[Tamil](/definition/tamil#history "show Tamil definitions") text and transliteration:**

ஈடும் எடுப்பும் இல் ஈசன் மாடு விடாது என் மனனே  
பாடும் என் நா அவன் பாடல் ஆடும் என் அங்கம் அணங்கே.

īṭum eṭuppum il īcaṉ māṭu viṭātu eṉ maṉaṉē  
pāṭum eṉ nā avaṉ pāṭal āṭum eṉ aṅkam aṇaṅkē.

**English translation of verse 1.6.3:**

My mind can never be away from Īcaṉ (Lord Supreme),  
Who makes no distinction ‘tween high and low;  
My tongue His glory sings at all times  
While my body danceth in ecstatic glow.

**Notes**

\(i\) The Lord does not extend special favours by reason of one’s high parentage, calibre and conduct, nor does He give up those of low descent, meagre intellect and poor conduct. He is absolutely impartial. †[Prahlāda](/definition/prahlada#vaishnavism "show Prahlāda definitions") and [Vibhīṣaṇa](/definition/vibhishana#vaishnavism "show Vibhīṣaṇa definitions") of Asura and [Rākṣasa](/definition/rakshasa#vaishnavism "show Rākṣasa definitions") clan, respectively, were among His beneficiaries. If the other Asuras and [Rākṣasas](/definition/rakshasa#vaishnavism "show Rākṣasas definitions") came to grief the fault was not with the Lord. It is like a few persons [falling](/definition/falling#history "show falling definitions"), now and then, into the [tank](/definition/tank#history "show tank definitions") dug up for the common good of all and [killing](/definition/killing#history "show killing definitions") themselves.

\(ii\) It is noteworthy that the [Āḻvār](/definition/aḻvar#vaishnavism "show Āḻvār definitions") stands rivetted to the Lord by word, deed and thought.
