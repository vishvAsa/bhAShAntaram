**[Tamil](/definition/tamil#history "show Tamil definitions") text and transliteration:**

இடம் கொள் சமயத்தை எல்லாம் எடுத்துக் களைவன போலே  
தடம் கடல் பள்ளிப் பெருமான் தன்னுடைப் பூதங்களே ஆய்  
கிடந்தும் இருந்தும் எழுந்தும் கீதம் பலபல பாடி  
நடந்தும் பறந்தும் குனித்தும் நாடகம் செய்கின்றனவே.

iṭam koḷ camayattai ellām eṭuttuk kaḷaivaṉa pōlē  
taṭam kaṭal paḷḷip perumāṉ taṉṉuṭaip pūtaṅkaḷē āy  
kiṭantum iruntum eḻuntum kītam palapala [pāṭi](/definition/pati#vaishnavism "show pāṭi definitions")  
naṭantum paṟantum kuṉittum nāṭakam ceykiṉṟaṉavē.

**English translation of verse 5.2.4:**

This land is full of ardent devotees of the Lord,  
Reposing on the milk-ocean; lying, sitting and standing.  
Walking along, [singing](/definition/singing#history "show singing definitions") many a song and [dancing](/definition/dancing#history "show dancing definitions"),  
[Flying](/definition/flying#history "show Flying definitions") about with heels above the ground, they ate revelling  
Like those out to uproot the heretical religions rampant in the world.

**Notes:**

\(i\) It is a matter of common knowledge that unwanted things easily multiply themselves at random and can be had in plenty dirt-cheap while [life](/definition/life#history "show life definitions")-saving herbs are very rare, needing such herculean effort to get at them, as Hanu-mān undertook to secure the life-giver, in the story of [Rāmāyaṇa](/definition/ramayana#vaishnavism "show Rāmāyaṇa definitions"), uprooting the mount as a whole. Even so, the heretical religions grow up like mushrooms on a rainy day, while the [Vedic](/definition/veda#vaishnavism "show Vedic definitions") religions are few, and so their propagation is limited. But now, the [Āḻvār](/definition/aḻvar#vaishnavism "show Āḻvār definitions") is most agreeably surprised to find the land seething with Śrī [Vaiṣṇavas](/definition/vaishnava#vaishnavism "show Vaiṣṇavas definitions"), bubbling with God-love. These Godlovers do not have to make any effort, as such, to root out the heresies. The latter will automatically vanish like the blade of grass when the [paddy](/definition/paddy#history "show paddy definitions") is harvested or the light introduced into a dark room, clearing the darkness as a matter-of-course.

\(ii\) As the devotees are entitled to even greater reverence than the Lord Himself, the Āḻvār enjoys the different postures of the devotees in their ravishing moments of God-love, even as he mentions the Lord’s postures of sitting, standing and lying, quite often.
