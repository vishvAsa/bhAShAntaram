**[Tamil](/definition/tamil#history "show Tamil definitions") text and transliteration:**

அருளாது ஒழிவாய் அருள்செய்து அடியேனைப்  
பொருளாக்கி உன்பொன்அடிக்கீழ்ப் புகவைப்பாய்  
மருளேஇன்றி உன்னை என்நெஞ்சத்துஇருத்தும்  
தெருளேதரு தென்திருநாவாய் என்தேவே!

aruḷātu oḻivāy aruḷceytu aṭiyēṉaip  
poruḷākki uṉpoṉaṭikkīḻp pukavaippāy  
maruḷēiṉṟi uṉṉai eṉneñcattuiruttum  
teruḷētaru teṉtirunāvāy eṉtēvē!

**English translation of verse 9.8.8:**

My Sire, in Tirunāvāy enshrined, grant me wisdom clear  
To lodge You firmly in my heart, with no inkling whatever  
Of nescience in me, albeit You shed not Your grace on me  
Nor deign to shelter me under Your feet lovely.

**Notes:**

Right at the beginning of this hymnal, it was elucidated that the [Āḻvār](/definition/aḻvar#vaishnavism "show Āḻvār definitions") was endowed by the Lord Himself, with clear-cut knowledge, full and complete, shorn of all discrepancies and deviations, [doubt](/definition/doubt#history "show doubt definitions") and despair. What is now prayed for is preservation of the clarity, already endowed, rather its stabilisation. Be he near or far from Him physically, mental proximity with the Lord, at all times and under all circumstances, is prayed for by the Āḻvār. While this is the interpretation of this song, by all the other glossators, Piḷḷāṉ has held this song to mean:

“My Lord, in the exercise of your sweet, spontaneous grace, you rid me of nescience, *in toto*, and dowered on me full and complete knowledge about your greatness and grandeur. It is, again, purely a matter of your grace, either way, whether or not you shelter me under your lovely feet, in due recognition of the fact that here I am, your vassal, intent upon rendering self-less service unto you”,
