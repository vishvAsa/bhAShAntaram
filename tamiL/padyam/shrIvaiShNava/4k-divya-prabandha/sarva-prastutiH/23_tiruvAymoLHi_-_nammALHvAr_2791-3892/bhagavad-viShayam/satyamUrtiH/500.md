**[Tamil](/definition/tamil#history "show Tamil definitions") text and transliteration:**

கிளர் ஒளியால் குறைவு இல்லா அரி உருவாய்க் கிளர்ந்து எழுந்து,  
கிளர் ஒளிய இரணியனது அகல் மார்பம் கிழித்து உகந்த,  
வளர் ஒளிய கனல் ஆழி வலம்புரியன் மணி நீல,  
வளர் ஒளியான் கவராத வரி வளையால் குறைவு இலமே.

kiḷar oḷiyāl kuṟaivu illā ari uruvāyk kiḷarntu eḻuntu,  
kiḷar oḷiya iraṇiyaṉatu akal mārpam kiḻittu ukanta,  
vaḷar oḷiya kaṉal āḻi valampuriyaṉ [maṇi](/definition/mani#vaishnavism "show maṇi definitions") [nīla](/definition/nila#history "show nīla definitions"),  
vaḷar oḷiyāṉ kavarāta [vari](/definition/vari#history "show vari definitions") vaḷaiyāl kuṟaivu ilamē.

**English translation of verse 4.8.7:**

I wouldn’t need the bangles nice, disliked by the Lord,  
Lustrous like the blue gem, who the discus flamboyant holds,  
Who, as ‘Ari’ the Man-[Lion](/definition/lion#history "show Lion definitions") of mounting radiance, emerged with rage  
And gladly split the broad chest of Iraṇiyaṉ, of prowess great.

**Notes**

\(i\) The Lord, who emerged as [Narasiṃha](/definition/narasimha#history "show Narasiṃha definitions"), the effulgent Man-Lion, split into two, the powerful [Hiraṇyā](/definition/hiranya#history "show Hiraṇyā definitions")’s broad chest and rejoiced that He had destroyed the enemy of [Prahlāda](/definition/prahlada#vaishnavism "show Prahlāda definitions"), His great devotee. The only [weapons](/definition/weapon#history "show weapons definitions"), He then used, were His sharp nails. The boons which had fortified the demon, virtually served as the feed for his gigantic strength of formidable proportions and yet it could hardly appease half the hunger of Narasiṃha’s nails. The ferocious Man-Lion’s formidable appearance with open mouth, tongue protruding over the lip, clenched fist, ready for the knock and tumultuous ejaculations, reduced [Hiraṇya](/definition/hiranya#history "show Hiraṇya definitions") to the sad plight of a roasted pig and the Lord tore him off effortlessly. The discus and the other weapons of the Lord should have obviously been flaming with rage that they could not be commissioned to share the spoils in the peculiar context of slaying the demon, armed with special boons of a bewildering variety.

\(ii\) The Nāyakī laments that she hardly needs to be bedecked, when He, who came to the aid of Prahlāda, the young lad whose very father had turned terribly hostile to him, would not succour her, who also pines for His patronage. (Iṭu)
