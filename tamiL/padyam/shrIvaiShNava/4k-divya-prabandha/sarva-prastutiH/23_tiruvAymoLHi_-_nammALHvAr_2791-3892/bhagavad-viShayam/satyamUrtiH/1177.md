**[Tamil](/definition/tamil#history "show Tamil definitions") text and transliteration:**

இல்லை அல்லல் எனக்கேல்இனி என்குறை?  
அல்லிமாதர் அமரும் திருமார்பினன்  
கல்லில் ஏய்ந்த மதிள்சூழ் திருக்கண்ணபுரம்  
சொல்ல நாளும் துயர் பாடுசாராவே.

illai allal eṉakkēliṉi eṉkuṟai?  
allimātar amarum tirumārpiṉaṉ  
kallil ēynta matiḷcūḻ tirukkaṇṇapuram  
colla nāḷum tuyar pāṭucārāvē.

**English translation of verse 9.10.10:**

All my miseries have gone and wants have I none,  
Sorrows are at a distance kept, at the mere mention  
Of the name of holy Tirukkaṇṇapuram, which stone [walls](/definition/wall#history "show walls definitions") enclose,  
Where resides the Lord on whose winsome chest does repose  
[Tiru](/definition/tiru#history "show Tiru definitions") ([Lakṣmī](/definition/lakshmi#vaishnavism "show Lakṣmī definitions")), His lotus-born spouse.

**Notes:**

The [Āḻvār](/definition/aḻvar#vaishnavism "show Āḻvār definitions") disclosed in the preceding song that he enjoys absolute freedom from miseries and that there is hardly any felicity that he lacks. He now says that this blissful state can be attained even by those who are incapable of [pursuing](/definition/pursuing#history "show pursuing definitions") the hard [line](/definition/line#history "show line definitions") of [Bhakti](/definition/bhakti#vaishnavism "show Bhakti definitions") or the path of loving surrender to His sweet grace (Prapatti), by merely mentioning the name of the holy centre, known as Tirukkaṇṇapuram. There dwells the Lord on whose winsome chest always stays the inseparable Divine Mother, the unfailing Mediatrix, the great intercessor between God and man, the very personification of grace, ever ready to wink at our countless transgressions.
