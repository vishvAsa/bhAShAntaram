**English translation of verse 9.6.6:**

Guileless that I am, I fell an easy [prey](/definition/prey#history "show prey definitions")  
To the wily overtures of Kaṇṇaṉ, my Lord,  
My soul, by Him sapped, cries out His name, night and day,  
And on [Kāṭkarai](/definition/katkarai#vaishnavism "show Kāṭkarai definitions") meditates where He does reside.

**Notes:**

The [Āḻvār](/definition/aḻvar#vaishnavism "show Āḻvār definitions"), who points the accusing finger at the Lord and calls Him names while in a state of desolation due to separation from Him, sinks all such thoughts, rather, forgets all about them, when the Lord presents Himself before him. Here then is the tantalising charm of the Lord. The Āḻvār took Him at His face value and thoroughly enjoyed his erstwhile union with Him. But when the Lord withdrew Himself from the Āḻvār, the latter was consigned to the bottom-most depths of dejection and felt completely sapped. And yet, he would keep ruminating over His blandishments during their erstwhile union.
