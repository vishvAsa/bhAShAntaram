**[Tamil](/definition/tamil#history "show Tamil definitions") text and transliteration:**

நீர் நுமது என்று இவை வேர்முதல் மாய்த்து இறை  
சேர்மின் உயிர்க்கு அதன் நேர் நிறை இல்லே.

nīr numatu eṉṟu ivai vērmutal māyttu [iṟai](/definition/iṟai#history "show iṟai definitions")  
cērmiṉ uyirkku ataṉ nēr niṟai illē.

**English translation of verse 1.2.3:**

[Cutting](/definition/cutting#history "show Cutting definitions") out, root and branch, all sense of ‘You’ and ‘Yours’ join the Lord; there is nothing as good as that for the Souls [there can be no greater felicity than that].

**Note**

It would indeed be difficult to enumerate the thousand and odd things to be eschewed and discarded. And so, the poet just tackles the root causes of all the evils, which have to be eradicated *in toto*. Instead of wording as ‘I’ and ‘Mine the [Āḻvār](/definition/aḻvar#vaishnavism "show Āḻvār definitions") has cautiously put it in the second person, as ‘You’ and ‘Yours in this stanza, lest the very things he abhors and advises others to eradicate should corrupt him even at the mere mention thereof, in the first person—the risk of getting his tongue blistered, avoided.
