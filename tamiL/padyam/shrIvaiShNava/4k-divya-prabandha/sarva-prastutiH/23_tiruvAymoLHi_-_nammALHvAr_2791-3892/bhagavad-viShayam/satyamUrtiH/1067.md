நளிர்ந்தசீர்உலகம் மூன்றுடன்வியப்ப நாங்கள்கூத்துஆடி நின்றுஆர்ப்ப  
பளிங்குநீர் முகிலின்பவளம்போல் கனிவாய்சிவப்பநீ காணவாராயே

**English translation of verse 9.2.4:**

You did unto me clarity impart and would from me never depart,  
Oh, my Master, reposing in [Puḷiṅkuṭi](/definition/pulinkuti#vaishnavism "show Puḷiṅkuṭi definitions"). You remain [seated](/definition/seat#history "show seated definitions")  
In [Varakuṇamaṅkai](/definition/varakunamankai#vaishnavism "show Varakuṇamaṅkai definitions") and in Vaikuṇṭam You keep standing,  
May You unto me shed Your grace cool that shall astound  
The worlds three and make us [dance](/definition/dance#history "show dance definitions") with joy, let us also behold  
Your bewitching fruit-like lips like unto the coral creeper  
That entwines the dark [cloud](/definition/cloud#history "show cloud definitions"), laden with limpid water.

**Notes:**

\(i\) In His iconic manifestation, the Lord assumes different postures; in certain pilgrim centres, He reposes, in some, He is seen seated, while, in others, He keeps standing. These can be adored individually as well as collectively, as in this song. As Saint [Nammāḻvār](/definition/nammalvar#vaishnavism "show Nammāḻvār definitions") contemplated on the manifestations of the Lord, in His worshippable Forms, at the various pilgrim centres, certain special aspects and attributes of the Lord presented themselves to him, forming the subject-matter of his [meditation](/definition/meditation#history "show meditation definitions"), in each centre. Thus, these three holy places, jointly mentioned here, throw light, according to the illuminating author of “[Ācārya](/definition/acarya#vaishnavism "show Ācārya definitions") Hṛdayam”, on the three progressive stages of God-love, known as “[Para Bhakti](/definition/parabhakti#vaishnavism "show Para Bhakti definitions")” “Para [Jñāna](/definition/jnana#vaishnavism "show Jñāna definitions")”, and ‘[Parama](/definition/parama#vaishnavism "show Parama definitions") [Bhakti](/definition/bhakti#vaishnavism "show Bhakti definitions")’.

Having endowed the [Āḻvār](/definition/aḻvar#vaishnavism "show Āḻvār definitions") with clarity of thought, shorn of [doubt](/definition/doubt#history "show doubt definitions"), discrepancy and deviation (8-8) and kindled in him God-love of rare magnitude, the Lord is now nestling round him in various postures, eager to get hold of him at the pinnacle of his devotion (parama Bhakti). The Lord is in the same predicament, as one, with pinching hunger, moving impatiently, in and around the kitchen where [food](/definition/food#history "show food definitions") is being cooked, vide aphorism 177 of ‘Ācārya Hṛdayam’.

\(ii\) It will certainly astound the denizens of the three worlds when they see that the Lord has responded to the entreaties of the Āḻvār and come out of His repose; the Āḻvār and the fellow-devotees will bubble with joy and dance, on seeing the Lord’s bewitching smiles from His radiant, red lips.
