எங்குவந்துஉறுகோ என்னைஆள்வானே ஏழ்உலகங்களும் நீயே  
அங்கு அவர்க்குஅமைத்த தெய்வமும்நீயே அவற்றுஅவை கருமமும் நீயே  
பொங்கியபுறம்பால் பொருள்உளவேலும் அவையுமோ நீ இன்னேஆனால்  
மங்கிய அறிவாம் நேர்ப்பமும் நீயே வான்புலன் இறந்ததும் நீயே.

**English translation of verse 8.1.6:**

My Sovereign Lord, the worlds seven and the deities worshipped therein,  
The rituals unto them performed as well as things in regions beyond,  
All things and beings, subtle or manifest are unto You bound;  
Well, such a one where and how do I attain?

**Notes:**

\(i\) The [Āḻvār](/definition/aḻvar#vaishnavism "show Āḻvār definitions")’s query is how he can, on his own, attain the Lord Who is the Supreme Controller of all the worlds, [Agni](/definition/agni#vaishnavism "show Agni definitions"), [Indra](/definition/indra#vaishnavism "show Indra definitions") and other deities, worshipped by the respective votaries in different climes, the rituals performed, as part of such worship, as well as all things lying in the regions beyond. How can a lame man get on to the top of Mount [Meru](/definition/meru#history "show Meru definitions")? The [lameness](/definition/lameness#history "show lameness definitions") denotes the incapacity to pursue the normal paths prescribed by the Scriptures to get at the Lord. But then, it behoves the Lord, as the Master, who has striven hard all the time for the Āḻvār’s evolution, right up to this stage, to follow it up to the point of final fruition, with no ancillary effort on his part.

\(ii\) As already stated in V-2-8, it is the Supreme Lord Who has set up in different climes the minor deities to receive the homage the votaries pay them and grant them boons. This is reinforced here. The prescriptive rites and rituals offered to these deities actually reach the Supreme Lord Whose agents these deities are, rather His bodies through which He carries out His multifarious functions.

\(iii\) As mentioned in [Śloka](/definition/sloka#vaishnavism "show Śloka definitions") 17 of Śrī Āḷavandār’s ‘Stotra [Ratna](/definition/ratna#history "show Ratna definitions")’, the Lord’s possessions ([Vibhūti](/definition/vibhuti#vaishnavism "show Vibhūti definitions")) are indeed very vast and immense, comprising, *inter alia*, the numerous Cosmic worlds with all their inner contents and the external multiplicity of layers, each of which is ten times bigger than the immediately preceding one. (yat daśottarāṉyāvaraṇāni yāni ca). The region beyond the seven worlds, alluded to in this song, denotes these external layers.
