**[Tamil](/definition/tamil#history "show Tamil definitions") text and transliteration:**

எந்தாய்! தண் திருவேங்கடத்துள் நின்றாய் இலங்கை செற்றாய், மராமரம்  
பைந்தாள் ஏழ் உருவ ஒரு வாளி கோத்த வில்லா,  
கொந்து ஆர் தண் அம் துழாயினாய் அமுதே உன்னை என்னுள்ளே குழைத்த எம்  
மைந்தா, வான் ஏறே இனி எங்குப் போகின்றதே?

entāy! taṇ tiruvēṅkaṭattuḷ niṉṟāy ilaṅkai ceṟṟāy, marāmaram

**English translation of verse 2.6.9:**

My Lord! gracing Tiruvēṅkaṭam, you stand on the cool mountain,  
You routed [Laṅkā](/definition/lanka#vaishnavism "show Laṅkā definitions"), pierce you did the tough [trees](/definition/tree#history "show trees definitions") seven  
With a single [arrow](/definition/arrow#history "show arrow definitions"), lovely tulacī garland, bushy and cool  
You sport, my Nectar! into me dissolved, you, my darling!  
Chief of Celestials!  
Is there anywhere You can get away hence?

**Note**

[[Āḻvār](/definition/aḻvar#vaishnavism "show Āḻvār definitions") to the Lord:]—

> “Unto me, who was steeped in ignorance, you revealed yourself and your > excellence and worked me upto the present pitch, wheṇ I just cannot > exist without you. Will it be just and proper for you to get parted > from me, at this stage? As a matter of fact, you stepped on Mount > Tiruvēṅkaṭam, only to get held of this vassal. Even as you routed > [Rāvaṇa](/definition/ravana#vaishnavism "show Rāvaṇa definitions") and > his Laṅkā, you eradicated my conceit and arrogance. Even as you > instilled confidence in > [Sugrīva](/definition/sugriva#vaishnavism "show Sugrīva definitions"), > before slaying his brother, > [Vāli](/definition/vali#vaishnavism "show Vāli definitions"), by > piercing the cluster of seven ‘sāl’ trees, with a single arrow, you > whetted my love for you by exhibiting your auspicious traits. Having > mingled with me, *in toto*, without reservation of any kind, how can > you at all get parted from me hereafter and where else will you go?”

The fact of the matter is that the blending of the two is so perfect that they are no longer two separate entities but just a single entity.
