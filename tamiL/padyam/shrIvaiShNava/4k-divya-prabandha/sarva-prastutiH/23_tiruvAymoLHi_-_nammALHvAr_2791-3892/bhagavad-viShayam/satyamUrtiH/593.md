உற்றார்கள் எனக்கு இல்லை யாரும் என்னும் உற்றார்கள் எனக்கு இங்கு எல்லாரும் என்னும்  
உற்றார்களைச் செய்வேனும் யானே என்னும் உற்றார்களை அழிப்பேனும் யானே என்னும்  
உற்றார்களுக்கு உற்றேனும் யானே என்னும் உற்றார் இலி மாயன் வந்து ஏறக்கொலோ?  
உற்றீர்கட்கு என் சொல்லிச் சொல்லுகேன் யான்? உற்று என்னுடைப் பேதை உரைக்கின்றவே?

**English translation of verse 5.6.7:**

What indeed can 1 tell you, my kinsmen?  
Says my little one, with vision clear, [relatives](/definition/relative#history "show relatives definitions") she has none  
And yet, all are related to her, she makes relations  
And ‘tis she that destroys them too, she is all-in-one  
Unto those that seek her, heart and soul; seems taken in  
By the wondrous Lord whom by mere self-effort none can attain?

#### Notes

\(i\) The Lord can be said to have no relations, in the sense that the individual souls either stray away from Him and run after minor deities or those that seek Him are not quite conscious of their true inter-relationship. In any case, none has ever attained Him through self-effort alone, without His co-operative grace.

\(ii\) All are related to the Lord, as they are all His subjects for whom He has great concern and He helps them all, unseen, even though they may not be conscious of this. Even if the subjects propitiate minor deities, He is the ultimate object of adoration, being the Internal Controller of those deities as well.

\(iii\) The Lord makes relatives in the sense that He attracts the subjects unto Him by exhibiting His charms. He also puts aside those, who are. by dint of their [Karma](/definition/karma#vaishnavism "show Karma definitions"), oblivious of their relationship with Him and are inclined towards minor deities. This is just as bad as destroying their relationship with Him. In a sense, the Lord can also be taken to destroy His devotees, exclusively related to Him, by making them solely absorbed in His beauty, traits and deeds and destroying their sense of individuality. Thus, they get literally lost in Him.

\(iv\) The Lord is ‘All-in-one’ and constitutes every conceivable relationship unto those that look upon Him, as the Sole Sustainer, (c.f. [Śloka](/definition/sloka#vaishnavism "show Śloka definitions") 5 of Stotra [Ratna](/definition/ratna#history "show Ratna definitions") of Saint [Yāmuna](/definition/yamuna#vaishnavism "show Yāmuna definitions"), where he adores Saint [Nammāḻvār](/definition/nammalvar#vaishnavism "show Nammāḻvār definitions"), in this manner.)
