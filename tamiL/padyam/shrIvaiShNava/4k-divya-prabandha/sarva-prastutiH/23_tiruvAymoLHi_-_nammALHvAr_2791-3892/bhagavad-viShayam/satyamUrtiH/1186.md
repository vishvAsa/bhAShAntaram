இடர்கெட எம்மைப் போந்துஅளியாய் என்றுஎன்று ஏத்தி  
சுடர்கொள் சோதியைத் தேவரும் முனிவரும் தொடர  
படர்கொள் பாம்பணைப் பள்ளிகொள்வான் திருமோகூர்  
இடர் கெடவடி பரவுதும் தொண்டீர்! வம்மினே.

**English translation of verse 10.1.4:**

Come, ye, devotees, worship we shall offer  
At the Lord’s distress-dispelling feet in Tirumōkūr,  
Where He on the capacious [serpent](/definition/serpent#history "show serpent definitions")-bed lays  
So as to grant audience unto sages and Celestials,  
Who His resplendent Form adore and many a time utter,  
“May it please You, my Lord, to come down here  
And our ills and evils cure.”

**Notes:**

\(i\) The [Āḻvār](/definition/aḻvar#vaishnavism "show Āḻvār definitions") invites the devout to come and worship the Lord, so easily accessible at Tirumōkūr and get rid of their miseries, *in toto*.

\(ii\) The sages and Celestials approach the Lord, whenever they are brought up against difficulties, and seek relief through Him; the Āḻvār too seeks succour from the Lord and yet, he stands on a different footing from others, in that he seeks not personal gains but eternal service unto the Lord, in keeping with his essential [nature](/definition/nature#history "show nature definitions") of being His exclusive vassal. The Sages of Daṇḍakāraṇya exhibited their emaciated bodies, tormented by the [Rākṣasas](/definition/rakshasa#vaishnavism "show Rākṣasas definitions") stalking the [forest](/definition/forest#history "show forest definitions"), to [Śrī Rāma](/definition/shrirama#history "show Śrī Rāma definitions") and sought from Him. mere restoration of their bodily comforts. In dire contrast to this, Saint [Nammāḻvār](/definition/nammalvar#vaishnavism "show Nammāḻvār definitions") prayed unto the Lord, right in the opening song of ‘[Tiruviruttam](/definition/tiruviruttam#vaishnavism "show Tiruviruttam definitions")’, the first of his four hymnals, to cut out altogether this bedevilled body of hit, full of dirt and disorderly conduct.
