**[Tamil](/definition/tamil#history "show Tamil definitions") text and transliteration:**

ஆறு மலைக்கு எதிர்ந்துஓடும் ஒலி, அரவு  
ஊறு சுலாய் மலை தேய்க்கும் ஒலி, கடல்  
மாறு சுழன்று அழைக்கின்ற ஒலி, அப்பன்  
சாறுபட அமுதம்கொண்ட நான்றே.

āṟu malaikku etirntuōṭum oli, aravu  
ūṟu culāy [malai](/definition/malai#history "show malai definitions") tēykkum oli, kaṭal  
[māṟu](/definition/maru#vaishnavism "show māṟu definitions") cuḻaṉṟu aḻaikkiṉṟa oli, appaṉ  
cāṟupaṭa amutamkoṇṭa nāṉṟē.

**English translation of verse 7.4.2:**

During the festive days when the great Sire for [Devas](/definition/deva#vaishnavism "show Devas definitions") gave  
The nectar from the ocean churned, the great [noise](/definition/noise#history "show noise definitions") came  
Of rivers bound for the ocean running back to the mountains,  
Of the mighty snake rustling round the gigantic mountain  
And of the oceanic water whirling round and round.

**Notes:**

When the momentous churning of the Milk-ocean took place, so great was the upheaval of the ocean that the rivers bound for the ocean were repulsed so fast that they had to swirl back to the mountains whence they sprang. And then, there was the mighty [serpent](/definition/serpent#history "show serpent definitions"), Vāsukī functioning as the [rope](/definition/rope#history "show rope definitions") churning the great mountain, making all the noise that the tremendous friction could produce; and to cap it all was the roaring of the oceanic water whirling with great momentum. What an astounding scene indeed! It is even more astonishing that the [Āḻvār](/definition/aḻvar#vaishnavism "show Āḻvār definitions") could visualise it in such graphic details at this distance of time. As already mentioned elsewhere, the Lord assumed multifarious roles in this breath-taking project.
