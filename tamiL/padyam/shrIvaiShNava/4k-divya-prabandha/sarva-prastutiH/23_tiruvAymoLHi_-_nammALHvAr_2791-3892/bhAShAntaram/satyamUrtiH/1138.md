**Tamil text and transliteration:**

தகவுஅன்றுஎன்று உரையீர்கள் தடம்புனல்வாய் இரைதேர்ந்து  
மிகஇன்பம் படமேவும் மேல்நடைய அன்னங்காள்  
மிகமேனி மெலிவுஎய்தி மேகலையும் ஈடுஅழிந்து என்  
அகமேனி ஒழியாமே திருமூழிக் களத்தார்க்கே.

takavuaṉṟueṉṟu uraiyīrkaḷ taṭampuṉalvāy iraitērntu  
mikaiṉpam paṭamēvum mēlnaṭaiya aṉṉaṅkāḷ  
mikamēṉi melivueyti mēkalaiyum īṭuaḻintu eṉ  
akamēṉi oḻiyāmē tirumūḻik kaḷattārkkē.

**English translation of verse 9.7.10:**

Ye, swans of gentle gait, moving along merrily in fields fertile.  
In search of food, unto the Lord in Tirumūḻikkaḷam go and tell,  
‘Tis hardly fair that He should despise me; only then,  
My body, the saree thereon and my inner soul I can retain.

**Notes:**

The great Ācāryas, who go about delving and gathering the most delicious meanings, the scriptural texts can possibly yield, are referred to here, as the swans, endowed with the special faculty of picking up milk from a mixture of milk and water. The Nāyakī’s appeal to the Lord’s special trait of mercy is bound to go home to Him, as He cannot afford to risk His reputation, as the All-merciful, No doubt, the Lord’s infinite mercy can never be exhausted even as the oceanic waters can never go dry. And yet, what is now sought to be pointed out by the Nāyakī is that His keeping aloof of her is by-no-means consistent with His great quality of mercy and cannot be deemed to be a happy trend, in this context.
