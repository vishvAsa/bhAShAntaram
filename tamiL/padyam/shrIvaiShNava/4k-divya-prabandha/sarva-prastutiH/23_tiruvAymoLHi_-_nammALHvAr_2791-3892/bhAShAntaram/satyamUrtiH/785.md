In Bhagavad Gītā (7-14), the Lord stated that those who take refuge in Him alone can get beyond Māyā (Prakṛti). Then and then only, the ‘Prakṛti’ helps towards liberation instead of hindering by concealing the real nature of the Lord. The net woven around each individual soul by the Almighty Lord, in the light of past Karma, has to be disentangled by Him alone, seeing that we are much-too-feeble and cannot disentangle even the nest built by a frail bird, in the manner it does. Only He can undo this bondage of ours, when we clasp His holy feet as the Sole Saviour. It was against this background that the Āḻvār sought refuge at the feet of the Lord at Tiruvēṅkaṭam in VI-10-10. But then, it didn’t yield the desired result immediately. Why was it so?

Who indeed can question the love and integrity of Bharata who did ‘Prapatti’ (surrender) unto Śrī Rāma, begging of Him to get back to Ayodhyā and take up the reins of the Kingdom? Why did Bharat’s surrender not meet with quick response? Well, the Ṛṣis of Daṇḍakāraṇya had surrendered unto Rāma earlier and He had promised them succour from the depredations of the Rākṣasas. Bound by this earlier commitment, Śrī Rāma could not obviously comply with Bharata’s request. Even so, some would appear to have surrendered unto the Lord prior to the point of time at which the Āḻvār did ‘Prapatti’, praying that they be blest with hymns *par excellence* for their uplift. As a matter of fact, the clue to this kind of inference can be had in X-7-5 which indicates the root-cause for the emergence of Tiruvāymoḻi, as such. That crucial stanza brings out: The sages met at a conclave and decided that they should pray unto the Lord for the birth of a work of this kind, which will do adequate justice in bringing out the Lord’s inherent nature, form, attributes, wealth and deeds. This was again due to the fact that they found the Sanskrit Vedantās (upaniṣads), meant to expatiate on the Lord’s greatness and grandeur, lagging far behind and retreating, admitting defeat—‘yato vāco nivartante’. The Lord Himself sang the Tiruvāymoḻi through Saint Nammāḻvār as His mouthpiece. Once Tiruvāymoḻi came into being, the sages found it had done full Justice to their cherished objectives and fully covered the various facets of the Lord, enumerated above, with the result that they very much wished that the Lord had still more attributes, treasures etc., so that they can have another work of such excellence, a complete reversal of their attitude towards the Upaniṣads.

And so, it is clear that the Lord deliberately delayed the consummation of the Āḻvār’s ‘Prapatti’ so as to get all the 1102 hymns from his sweet lips, the full length of this splendid treatise which would have otherwise remained truncated.

In this decad, the Āḻvār follows up the trend of thought as in VI-9-9 where he dreaded the mischief of the senses and the frightful possibility of his going astray in the event of the prolongation of his stay in this abode. It might, however, be questioned why the Āḻvār, who was well beyond the mischief of the senses, having taken a deep plunge into the ocean of divine consciousness, should dread in this manner. For this, the Āḻvār has himself provided the answer. This land is notorious for its corrupting influence, bringing within its dirty pale even the ‘Nitya Sūrīs’, the Attendants in close proximity to the Lord in Heaven, should they ever happen to come on to this soil. Further, when a person sees the houses ail around, on fire, he has got to apprehend the danger of his own house catching fire and safeguard it. A rope lying by the side of an anti-hill, the hide-out of serpents, is easily mistaken for a serpent. So also, the Āḻvār possessing a body like unto that of the worldlings, grows apprehensive about himself, finding those other persons dominated by the wayward senses.
