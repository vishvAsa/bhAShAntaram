**[Tamil](/definition/tamil#history "show Tamil definitions") text and transliteration:**

இன்றுபோய்ப் புகுதிராகில் எழுமையும் ஏதம்சாரா  
குன்றுநேர் மாடம்மாடே குருந்துசேர் செருந்திபுன்னை  
மன்றலர் பொழில் அனந்தபுரநகர் மாயன்நாமம்  
ஒன்றும்ஓர் ஆயிரமாம் உள்ளுவார்க்கு உம்பர்ஊரே

iṉṟupōyp pukutirākil eḻumaiyum ētamcārā  
kuṉṟunēr māṭammāṭē kuruntucēr ceruntipuṉṉai  
maṉṟalar poḻil aṉantapuranakar māyaṉnāmam  
oṉṟumōr āyiramām uḷḷuvārkku umparūrē

**English translation of verse 10.2.2:**

Sins shall not get near you for generations,  
If You’d this day get into [Aṉantapuram](/definition/anantapuram#vaishnavism "show Aṉantapuram definitions") with gardens fine,  
Holding stately [trees](/definition/tree#history "show trees definitions") and castles tall, rising like mountains;  
A single name of the Lord, enshrined there, is as potent  
As a thousand names and for those, who that name do chant,  
That holy Centre becomes the very [Heaven](/definition/heaven#history "show Heaven definitions") indeed.

**Notes:**

\(i\) “The name of the Lord at Aṉantapuram shall by itself extend unto you protection, on all fronts. If you’d only get into that holy centre, sins shall not come near you, not only now but in all successive [births](/definition/birth#history "show births definitions")”, this is how the [Āḻvār](/definition/aḻvar#vaishnavism "show Āḻvār definitions") exhorts the people around. The mere mention of the name of the Lord, enshrined there, will transform that place into Heaven. Yet another way of interpreting the text of this song is that one need not even go to Aṉantapuram, as such, but one is assured of heavenly ascent, by merely spelling out the name of the Lord enshrined there, a name that is potent enough to fulfil the functions of the other names, as well.

\(ii\) “*Castles rising like mountains*”—Unlike the ordinary run of man-kind, given to hurrying, those soaked in God-love move about leisurely, [enjoying](/definition/enjoying#history "show enjoying definitions") the sight of the high mansions, turrets and towers lining the streets of pilgrim centres, drinking them in, as it were, with their eyes, in rapturous admiration.
