**Tamil text and transliteration:**

வதுவை வார்த்தையுள் ஏறு பாய்ந்ததும் மாய மாவினை வாய் பிளந்ததும்  
மதுவை வார் குழலார் குரவை பிணைந்த குழகும்  
அது இது உது என்னலாவன அல்ல என்னை உன் செய்கை நைவிக்கும்  
முது வைய முதல்வா! உன்னை என்று தலைப்பெய்வனே?

vatuvai vārttaiyuḷ ēṟu pāyntatum māya māviṉai vāy piḷantatum  
matuvai vār kuḻalār kuravai piṇainta kuḻakum  
atu itu utu eṉṉalāvaṉa alla eṉṉai uṉ ceykai naivikkum  
mutu vaiya mutalvā! uṉṉai eṉṟu talaippeyvaṉē?

**English translation of verse 5.10.2:**

Oh, Primate, your wondrous deeds do description baffle  
And make me thaw down; pounce you did upon the bulls  
When the talk of your wedding (Nappiṉṉai) was on,  
The mouth of the treacherous fiend, horse-shaped, you tore open,  
Dance you did merrily in the sweet company  
Of those damsels whose locks shed plenty of honey;  
When can I your lovely feet attain?

#### Note

The moment the challenging task of taming the seven unruly bulls, all at once, was set up as a pre-condition by the fair Nappiṉṉai’s father for winning her hand, Kṛṣṇa dashed forward and pounced upon the animals, killing them all. Again, when Kṛṣṇa was in the company of the Gopis, a demon in the disguise of a horse came running fiercely to trample upon Him, but, with perfect case, He tore open the longish mouth of the treacherous horse and put an end to it. And then, there was the classical ‘Rāsa Krīḍa’ in which Kṛṣṇa assumed many forms and stood beside each Gopi, vide detailed notes given earlier about this *wonderful wonder of wonders*. There is hardly any need to single out any one of His many deeds. Each and every one of His deeds sends the Āḻvār into raptures and sweeps him off his feet. And so, he prays that he may at least have the requisite stamina to sustain and steady himself, recount the Lord’s glory and revel in it without breaking down.
