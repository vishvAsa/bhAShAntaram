**Tamil text and transliteration:**

ஆள்கின்றான் ஆழியான் ஆரால் குறைவுஉடையம்?  
மீள்கின்றதுஇல்லை பிறவித் துயர்கடிந்தோம்  
வாள்கெண்டை ஒண்கண் மடப்பின்னை தன்கேள்வன்  
தாள்கண்டு கொண்டு என் தலைமேல் புனைந்தேனே.

āḷkiṉṟāṉ āḻiyāṉ ārāl kuṟaivuuṭaiyam?  
mīḷkiṉṟatuillai piṟavit tuyarkaṭintōm  
vāḷkeṇṭai oṇkaṇ maṭappiṉṉai taṉkēḷvaṉ  
tāḷkaṇṭu koṇṭu eṉ talaimēl puṉaintēṉē.

**English translation of verse 10.4.3:**

The Lord, Who the discus wields, did us liberate  
From the miseries of birth, once for all; there’s none else  
Whose help we need, my head I do decorate  
With the lovely feet of the bright, fish-eyed Piṉṉai’s Spouse.

**Notes:**

The Āḻvār’s mind is now absolutely clear about the immediate prospect of his ascent to Heaven and so sanguine is he that he asserts that his age-long misery of birth and rebirth is gone and that there is no question of his getting caught up in the dreadful cycle, any more. Even so, a little later, that is, X-10-2, he pleads vehemently with the Lord for the quick consummation of their deeply-longed-for union and even goes to the extent of binding Him and His Consort (Mahā Lakṣmī) on oath, for the accomplishment of the goal in question. Questioned by the Lord Himself, in that context, regarding the propriety of the Āḻvār binding Him and the Divine Mother on oath, the Āḻvār is quick to justify his conduct because of the exuberance of his God-love and his impatience to get at Him.
