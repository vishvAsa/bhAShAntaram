**Tamil text and transliteration:**

தானே உலகுஎல்லாம் தானே படைத்துஇடந்து  
தானே உண்டுஉமிழ்ந்து தானே ஆள்வானே.

tāṉē ulakuellām tāṉē paṭaittuiṭantu  
tāṉē uṇṭuumiḻntu tāṉē āḷvāṉē.

**English translation of verse 10.5.3:**

‘Tis He (Nārāyaṇa), Who does the whole universe pervade,  
Who did create it all with no external aid,  
Who did in His stomach sustain all the worlds  
And then spat them out; ‘tis He who did once again  
Lift the Earth from deep waters, everything He does ordain.

**Notes:**

The meaning of the word, ‘Nārāyaṇa’, is expounded further, particularly, the role of the Lord, as the Protector of one and all. The entire universe constitutes His very body and as such, He is bound to sustain His body. He is the sole Architect of the Universe, combining in Himself the triple causes of creation, the *Material*, the *Operative* and the *Instrumental* causes. Creation of the Universe, dowering myriads of souls with the appropriate bodies, the vehicles of expression or the media of evolution, is by itself the Lord’s act of grace galore. On the top of that, He sustains all the worlds, with their massive contents of things and beings, inside His stomach during the deluge and thus saves them all from being swept off and dismembered by the whirling waters of terrific depth and width. And then, He spits them back into their erstwhile positions, quite *in tact*. The several facets of the Lord’s universal protection are thus indicated.
