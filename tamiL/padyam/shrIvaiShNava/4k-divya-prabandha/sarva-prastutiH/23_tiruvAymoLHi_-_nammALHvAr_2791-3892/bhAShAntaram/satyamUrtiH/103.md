**Tamil text and transliteration:**

கொண்டான் ஏழ் விடை, உண்டான் ஏழ்வையம்,  
தண் தாமம் செய்து, என் எண்தானானானே.

koṇṭāṉ ēḻ viṭai, uṇṭāṉ ēḻvaiyam,  
taṇ tāmam ceytu, eṉ eṇtāṉāṉāṉē.

**English translation of verse 1.8.7:**

Tamed He the unruly bulls seven,  
Held He in His stomach the worlds seven  
And thinking my own thoughts (in reverse direction)  
He took to my body as if it were cool heaven.

**Notes**

\(i\) To win the hand of the bewitching young damsel, Nap-piṇṇai, a niece of Yaśodhā, the unruly bulls were the impediments; the Lord, as Śrī Kṛṣṇa, overcame them and secured the coveted bride. Likewise, the Āḻvār’s sins, the impediments for the Lord getting at him, were rooted out by Him and the Āḻvār taken possession of.

\(ii\) During the period of deluge, the Lord held within Himself all the worlds and sustained them and now, He could sustain Himself only by entering the Āḻvār’s soul and dissolving into it.

\(iii\) The Āḻvār was pining for his ascent to Heaven, dipping in the Sacred river Vrajā, coursing on its border and chanting Sāma Veda in heaven; these very thoughts the Lord would, however, think in the reverse order, namely, pining for the Āḻvār’s body in Tirunakari, dipping in the river Tāmraparṇi and singing the hymns composed by the Sweet-tongued poet (Madhura Kavi) in adoration of the Āḻvār.
