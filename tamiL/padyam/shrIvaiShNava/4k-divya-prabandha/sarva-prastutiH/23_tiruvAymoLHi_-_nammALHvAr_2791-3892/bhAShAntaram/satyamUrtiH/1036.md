**[Tamil](/definition/tamil#history "show Tamil definitions") text and transliteration:**

வியன் மூவுலகு பெறினும்போய் தானே தானே ஆனாலும்  
புயல் மேகம்போல் திருமேனிஅம்மான் புனைபூம் கழல்அடிக்கீழ்ச்  
சயமே அடிமை தலைநின்றார் திருத்தாள் வணங்கி இம்மையே  
பயனே இன்பம் யான்பெற்றது உறுமோ பாவியேனுக்கே?

viyaṉ mūvulaku peṟiṉumpōy tāṉē tāṉē āṉālum  
puyal mēkampōl tirumēṉiammāṉ puṉaipūm kaḻalaṭikkīḻc  
cayamē aṭimai talainiṉṟār tiruttāḷ vaṇaṅki immaiyē  
payaṉē iṉpam yāṉpeṟṟatu uṟumō pāviyēṉukkē?

**English translation of verse 8.10.2:**

Neither sovereignty over the sprawling worlds three  
Nor enjoyment of one’s self, freed from [bondage](/definition/bondage#history "show bondage definitions"), can equal the bliss,  
This sinner has attained, of adoring the feet lovely  
Of the self-less devotees in the vanguard of service  
Unto the [cloud](/definition/cloud#history "show cloud definitions")-hued Lord bedecked with lovely flowers and anklet victorious.

**Notes:**

\(i\) Even the combined gift of vast wealth and the ‘[Kaivalya](/definition/kaivalya#vaishnavism "show Kaivalya definitions")’ state of perennial freedom from bodily ties, cannot equalise the bliss of service at the holy feet of the self-less apostles of the Lord, His hot favourites.

\(ii\) The self-enjoyment, referred to, in the second [line](/definition/line#history "show line definitions"), is the ‘Kaivalya’ state, denoted by the phrase in the first line of the original text of this song, “self becoming self”. The self in [family](/definition/family#history "show family definitions") bondage, cannot enjoy itself, having to be in the midst of the family members, sharing their weal and woe. If it attained [Heaven](/definition/heaven#history "show Heaven definitions") and partook of the bliss of eternal service unto the Lord, it has to be in the [company](/definition/company#history "show company definitions") of the glorious attendants over there and once again, there is no scope for solitary enjoyment of one’s own self. And so, the phrase in question could denote only the ‘Kaivalya’ experience or enjoyment of itself by the emancipated soul, in disembodied state. Although this is an eternal state, the [Āḻvār](/definition/aḻvar#vaishnavism "show Āḻvār definitions") would not regard it as the ultimate value (Puruṣārta) worth coveting, rather, he shuns it all along.
