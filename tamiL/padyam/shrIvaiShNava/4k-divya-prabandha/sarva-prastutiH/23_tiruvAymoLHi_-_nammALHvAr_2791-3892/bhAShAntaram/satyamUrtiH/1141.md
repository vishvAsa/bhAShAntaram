In the last decad, the Saint despatched several messengers to the Lord at Tirumūḻikkaḷam and yet, he could hardly contain the effervescence of God-love in him. He could not patiently await the return of the emissaries from the Lord and so, he tried to sustain himself by meeting the Lord enshrined in Tirunāvāy (another pilgrim centre in Kerala State, the number of such pilgrim centres in that State adding up to thirteen.) But, in his present state of desolation and debility, he could not make the trip to that pilgrim centre. The next best he could do was, therefore, to meditate on the Lord at Tirunāvāy, right from where he was. This is precisely what he does, in this decad. As Nampiḷḷai puts it, the Āḻvār was now in the same mental state as Sītā was, during the period intervening Hanumān’s visit to her in Aśokavana and her eventual restoration to Lord Rāma.
