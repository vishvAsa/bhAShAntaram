**Tamil text and transliteration:**

பற்பநாபன் உயர்வு அற உயரும் பெரும் திறலோன்,  
எற்பரன் என்னை ஆக்கிக் கொண்டு எனக்கே தன்னைத் தந்த  
கற்பகம், என் அமுதம் கார் முகில் போலும் வேங்கட நல்  
வெற்பன், விசும்போர் பிரான் எந்தை தாமோதரனே.

paṟpanāpaṉ uyarvu aṟa uyarum perum tiṟalōṉ,  
eṟparaṉ eṉṉai ākkik koṇṭu eṉakkē taṉṉait tanta  
kaṟpakam, eṉ amutam kār mukil pōlum vēṅkaṭa nal  
veṟpaṉ, vicumpōr pirāṉ entai tāmōtaraṉē.

**English translation of verse 2.7.11:**

On Paṟpanāpaṉ’s navel sprouted the lotus  
Whence ail worlds came, of matchless prowess,  
And in me wholly absorbed. He is the ‘*Kaṛpaka*’ tree.  
That yielded me and then gave itself unto me;  
Chief of Celestials, Vēṅkaṭam is His favourite abode, He’s my nectar,  
The cloud-hued Lord, Tāmōtaraṉ is my loving Master,

**Notes**

\(i\) The Āḻvār says that the Supreme Lord, with none above Him, is also the humblest; having made the Āḻvār His vassal, the Lord is wholly absorbed in him, making it appear that He knows no one else.

\(ii\) The ‘*Kaṛpaka*’ tree is the legendary wish-yielding tree. Even as there is a vast gulf between the Lord’s attributes and the comparable material in each case, the Lord, taken as the ‘*Kaṛpaka*’ tree, differs from it in the following essential respects:

> (*a*) the supplicant is also the Lord’s creation;  
> (*b*) the Supplicant gets absorbed in the Lord;  
> (*c*) the supplicant gets not only all that he wants but gets the Lord > Himself, who is thus the extraordinary tree, giving itself to the > Seeker; and  
> (*d*) the Lord Himself becomes the object of enjoyment by His > devotees.
