**Tamil text and transliteration:**

மாயமயக்கு மயக்கான் என்னை வஞ்சித்து  
ஆயன் அமரர்க்கு அரிஏறு எனதுஅம்மான்  
தூய சுடர்ச்சோதி தனதுஎன்னுள் வைத்தான்  
தேசம் திகழும் தன்திருவருள் செய்தே.

māyamayakku mayakkāṉ eṉṉai vañcittu  
āyaṉ amararkku ariēṟu eṉatuammāṉ  
tūya cuṭarccōti taṉatueṉṉuḷ vaittāṉ  
tēcam tikaḻum taṉtiruvaruḷ ceytē.

**English translation of verse 8.7.4:**

The Divine Cowherd of limitless glory, even Celestials can’t comprehend,  
Has unto me displayed His grace galore of universal fame,  
His resplendent Form immaculate, He has in my heart planted firm,  
A solid reality this is and not an illusion, as I did apprehend.

**Notes:**

The Āḻvār is now quite clear in his mind, that the Lord is really regaling in his heart and avers that it is a matter beyond doubt. As a matter of fact, in His unbounded love for the Āḻvār, the immaculate Lord has set His dazzling feet, dispelling darkness and distress, inside the Āḻvār, keeping all the worlds spell-bound by this act of grace galore. Surely, He would not play ducks and drakes with His devotees and bewilder them, as He did in the case of the ungodly Duryodhana and others of his ilk.
