**Tamil text and transliteration:**

குன்றம் எடுத்தபிரான் அடியாரொடும்,  
ஒன்றிநின்ற சடகோபன்உரைசெயல்,  
நன்றி புனைந்த ஓர்ஆயிரத்துள் இவை  
வென்றி தரும்பத்தும் மேவிக் கற்பார்க்கே (2)

kuṉṟam eṭuttapirāṉ aṭiyāroṭum,  
oṉṟiniṉṟa caṭakōpaṉuraiceyal,  
naṉṟi puṉainta ōrāyirattuḷ ivai  
veṉṟi tarumpattum mēvik kaṟpārkkē (2)

**English translation of verse 7.4.11:**

Success in many ways will these ten beneficent songs confer  
On those that learn them, out of the thousand composed  
By Caṭakōpaṉ who did unto the devotees adhere  
Of the Benefactor great, Who aloft did mount Govardan hold.

**Notes:**

The Āḻvār feels as if he is one of those who took shelter under mount Govardan, when Lord Kṛṣṇa held it aloft. It could also be interpreted as his joining the rank and file of the Śrī Vaiṣṇavas, who have sought refuge at the Lord’s feet, scared of the worldly life, like unto those in the pastoral village, who took shelter under Govardan. As Nampiḷḷai puts it, the Āḻvār feels drawn towards the Lord’s remarkable simplicity in holding aloft Govardan for a whole week and His exquisite charm in that position. And so, he gives vent to his Joy by mentally mingling with those who were then under the Lord’s protective umbrella. Surely, the chanters of this decad which sets out, one by one, the Lord’s victorious achievements, will be crowned with success in all their undertakings.
