**Tamil text and transliteration:**

வலஞ்செய்து வைகல் வலம் கழியாதே,  
வலஞ்செய்யும் ஆய மாயவன் கோயில்,  
வலஞ்செய்யும் வானோர் மாலிருஞ்சோலை,,  
வலஞ்செய்து நாளும் மருவுதல் வழக்கே.

valañceytu vaikal valam kaḻiyātē,  
valañceyyum āya māyavaṉ kōyil,  
valañceyyum vāṉōr māliruñcōlai,,  
valañceytu nāḷum maruvutal vaḻakkē.

**English translation of verse 2.10.8:**

Acquire strength all right but waste it never,  
Better go round daily Māliruñ Cōlai where stands enshrined  
The wondrous shepherd (Kṛṣṇa), our great Benefactor  
And the Celestials come down and move around.

**Notes**

\(1\) The Lord gives Himself unto His devotees, besides the strength to enjoy the rapport with Him. Lord Aḻakar Himself goes round Mount Māliruñcōḷai, in the company of His Consorts, even as Śrī Rāma and Sītā went round, hand in hand, the mountain slopes of Citrakūṭa.

Even as the citizens of Ayodhyā followed Śrī Rāma when he went into exile, the Celestials do come to this pilgrim centre and circumambulate the temple of Aḻakar. It would indeed be a grievous misuse of the specially endowed human body, highly conducive to holding communion with the Lord and serving Him in a number of ways, if it strayed into the domain of sensual pleasures, thus moving in the opposite direction.

\(ii\) Nañcīyar is said to have related from personal experience how he observed Śrī Parāśara Bhaṭṭar and Piḷḷai Tirunarayūr Arayar, leisurely pacing about the premises of the temples, gazing at the tall turrets and the lovely mansions around, in short, imbibing every small detail, literally drinking them in, with their eyes. This was in dire contrast to the men of the world to whom visiting temples is a mere formality, moving about like racehorses, as if it is a place more to hurry from. For the great Savants to whom the Lord is at once the Means and the End, temples are places to stay and serve. No doubt, genuflections and circumambulations do not serve as the ‘Means’ for them and yet, they get absorbed in the sanctity of the temples and their surroundings, as an end in itself.
