**[Tamil](/definition/tamil#history "show Tamil definitions") text and transliteration:**

இட்டகால் இட்ட கையளாய் இருக்கும் எழுந்துஉலாய் மயங்கும் கை கூப்பும்,  
கட்டமே காதல்! என்று மூர்ச்சிக்கும் கடல்வண்ணா! கடியைகாண் என்னும்,  
வட்டவாய் நேமி வலங்கையா! என்னும் வந்திடாய் என்றுஎன்றே மயங்கும்,  
சிட்டனே செழுநீர்த் திருவரங்கத்தாய்! இவள்திறத்து என் சிந்தித்தாயே?

iṭṭakāl iṭṭa kaiyaḷāy irukkum eḻuntuulāy mayaṅkum kai kūppum,  
kaṭṭamē kātal! eṉṟu mūrccikkum kaṭalvaṇṇā! kaṭiyaikāṇ eṉṉum,  
vaṭṭavāy [nēmi](/definition/nemi#history "show nēmi definitions") valaṅkaiyā! eṉṉum vantiṭāy eṉṟueṉṟē mayaṅkum,  
ciṭṭaṉē ceḻunīrt tiruvaraṅkattāy! ivaḷtiṟattu eṉ cintittāyē?

**English translation of verse 7.2.4:**

Sometimes this lady is motionless and she moves about, at times,  
Insensate she remains but still seen with joined palms,  
She swoons, exclaiming, “God-love is indeed hard to endure”;  
Says she, “Oh, sea-hued Lord, You are unto me much too severe”,  
Calling out many a time, Him that wields the discus round  
In His right hand, she faints when He comes not; oh, Lord immaculate.  
Reclining in fertile Tiruvaraṅkam, what is it you do for her contemplate?

**Notes:**

\(i\) The Nāyakī, intoxicated with God-love, exhibits the same behaviour as those struck by [Śrī Rāma](/definition/shrirama#history "show Śrī Rāma definitions")’s mighty [arrows](/definition/arrow#history "show arrows definitions"). The targets of those arrows will be severally seen fainting with [pain](/definition/pain#history "show pain definitions"), tortured or running about here and there in great fright. So also, the Nāyakī is at times insensate, sometimes, she moves about here and there agitated, and at other times, feels tortured by the immensity of her God-hunger still remaining unappeased. The [Āḻvār](/definition/aḻvar#vaishnavism "show Āḻvār definitions"), who was hitherto looking upon God-love as an end in itself, now feels it a terrible-tormenter, much beyond his capacity to endure.

\(ii\) The mother’s reference to an Immaculate God is rather ironical. She seems to suggest that, after inflicting all this pain on her daughter, He masquerades as the perfect One, like unto a [Brahmin](/definition/brahmin#history "show Brahmin definitions") going about chanting [Vedas](/definition/veda#vaishnavism "show Vedas definitions"), wearing white sacred thread and twisted [Kuśā](/definition/kusha#vaishnavism "show Kuśā definitions") grass in the fourth finger, the very picture of a perfect Brahmin, after [killing](/definition/killing#history "show killing definitions") several [Brahmins](/definition/brahmin#history "show Brahmins definitions").

\(iii\) *Fertile Tiruvaraṅkam*: The mother chides the Lord whether He came down to that cosy place only to sleep away, unmindful of the precarious condition of her daughter and His duty towards her.
