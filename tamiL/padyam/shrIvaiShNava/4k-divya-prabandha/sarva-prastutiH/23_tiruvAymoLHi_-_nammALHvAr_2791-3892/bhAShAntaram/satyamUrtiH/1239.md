**Tamil text and transliteration:**

நாடீர் நாள்தோறும் வாடா மலர்கொண்டு  
பாடீர் அவன்நாமம் வீடே பெறலாமே.

nāṭīr nāḷtōṟum vāṭā malarkoṇṭu  
pāṭīr avaṉnāmam vīṭē peṟalāmē.

**English translation of verse 10.5.5:**

Attain you shall emancipation  
If you worship the Lord daily  
With fresh flowers and sing gaily  
His holy names, set to nice tunes.

**Notes:**

When one renders service unto the Lord, in keeping with one’s essential nature, as the exclusive vassal of the Lord, solely dependent on Him, one is sure to attain Heaven, the final emancipation from the terrific cycle of birth and death and eternal service unto the Lord in Heaven, in close proximity. The worship of the Lord has to go on, all the time, even as one satiates one’s hunger by taking food with regular frequency. It is not mere spelling out the Lord’s names that the Āḻvār speaks of here but singing the names tunefully.
