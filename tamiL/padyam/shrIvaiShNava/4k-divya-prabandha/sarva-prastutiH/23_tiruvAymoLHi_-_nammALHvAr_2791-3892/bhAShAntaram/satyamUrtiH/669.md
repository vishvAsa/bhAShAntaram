**[Tamil](/definition/tamil#history "show Tamil definitions") text and transliteration:**

போயிருந்து நின் புள்ளுவம் அறியாதவர்க்கு உரை நம்பீ! நின்செய்ய-  
வாய் இருங் கனியும் கண்களும் விபரீதம் இந் நாள்  
வேய் இரும் தடம் தோளினார் இத்திருவருள் பெறுவார்எவர் கொல்  
மா இரும் கடலைக் கடைந்த பெருமானாலே?

pōyiruntu niṉ puḷḷuvam aṟiyātavarkku urai nampī! niṉceyya-  
vāy iruṅ kaṉiyum kaṇkaḷum viparītam in nāḷ  
vēy irum taṭam tōḷiṉār ittiruvaruḷ peṟuvārevar kol  
mā irum kaṭalaik kaṭainta perumāṉālē?

**English translation of verse 6.2.3:**

Oh, Sire, better keep off from us and try Your viles  
On girls unwary; indeed Your red fruit-like lips and eyes  
Are more charming than ever before; I know not who are those,  
With bamboo-like shoulders fine that shall be blest  
To enjoy this great Churner of the ocean, deep and vast.

#### Note

The Lord who was asked to go and fend the cows and play the flute, as in the last song, affirmed that He could play the flute and give vent to His love all right, only in the [company](/definition/company#history "show company definitions") of His beloved ones, of which the Nāyakī was indeed the crown [jewel](/definition/jewel#history "show jewel definitions"). But the Nāyakī was adamant and retorted that she would not be led away by His guiles any more and that He would rather play His pranks on unwary customers elsewhere and get on with them. The Lord appealed to her once again, asking her to behold His eagerness to taste the bliss of kissing her lips and gazing at her charming figure. Lo! she found His lips and eyes even more charming than ever before. Overpowered that she was by the Lord’s exquisite charm, she couldn’t help giving expression to it, even in the midst of her feminine rancour. She thought within herself, who those blessed damsels would be, that shall have the most enviable rapport with the charming Lord, like unto the Divine Mother who got at Him through the churning of the Milky ocean.
