**Tamil text and transliteration:**

வெற்பை ஒன்று எடுத்து, ஒற்கம் இன்றியே,  
நிற்கும் அம்மான் சீர், கற்பன் வைகலே.

veṟpai oṉṟu eṭuttu, oṟkam iṉṟiyē,  
niṟkum ammāṉ cīr, kaṟpaṉ vaikalē.

**English translation of verse 1.8.4:**

Let me every day utter (and adore)  
The Lord’s grace galore;  
Mount (Govardhana) He did lift  
And stood with ease (holding it aloft).

**Notes**

\(i\) Periyāḻvār extols the effortless holding by Śrī Kṛṣṇa of Govardhana Mountain, days on end, without the slightest strain on His fingers and nails (Periyāḻvār Tirumoḻi III-5-10).

\(ii\) Śrī Kūrattāḻvāṉ also exclaims, in sloka 45 of *Varadarāja Stavaṃ* that the Lord held Mount Govardhana continually for seven days and yet, His fingers were as fresh as ever.

\(iii\) The irate Indra, out to destroy the pastoral life of Gokul, could have well been destroyed by Śrī Kṛṣṇa but He relented, hoping that Indra would soon recover from this temporary aberration caused by the deprivation of the offerings. At the same time. He shielded the entire pastoral community by holding the mountain aloft like an umbrella for seven long days, till Indra’s fury abated. The Āḻvār, on his part, would never feel tired of recounting this episode, rather he subsists on it.
