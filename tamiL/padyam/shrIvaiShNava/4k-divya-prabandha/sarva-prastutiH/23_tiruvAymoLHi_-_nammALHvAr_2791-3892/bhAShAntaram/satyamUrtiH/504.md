உயிரினால் குறைவு இல்லா உலகு ஏழ் தன்னுள் ஒடுக்கி,  
தயிர் வெண்ணெய் உண்டானைத், தடம் குருகூர்ச் சடகோபன்,  
செயிர் இல் சொல் இசைமாலை ஆயிரத்துள் இப்பத்தால்  
வயிரம்சேர் பிறப்பு அறுத்து வைகுந்தம் நண்ணுவரே. (2)

**English translation of verse 4.8.11:**

Those that chant these songs ten  
Out of the thousand, flawless and mellifluous, of Caṭakōpaṉ,  
Adoring the Lord, Who did in Him compress and sustain  
The souls innumerable and their worlds seven  
And then ate up the curds and butter (as child Divine),  
Will have their chronic cycle of [birth](/definition/birth#history "show birth definitions") and [death](/definition/death#history "show death definitions") ended  
And attain Vaikuṇṭam (the high [heaven](/definition/heaven#history "show heaven definitions"))

**Note**

Unlike the worshipper at the sanctum, remaining worried about the safety of the pair of sandals left by him at the [temple](/definition/temple#history "show temple definitions") gate, the Lord attended to His cosmic duties first, such as the sustenance of the worlds and their contents in His stomach during the [deluge](/definition/deluge#history "show deluge definitions"), and then addressed Himself to the task of eating up the curds and butter in the pastoral [village](/definition/village#history "show village definitions") of [Gokula](/definition/gokula#vaishnavism "show Gokula definitions"), with no let or hindrance from other quarters. Even as [pregnant](/definition/pregnant#history "show pregnant definitions") women get extra-nourishment, the Lord, holding in His stomach all things and beings, had all the nourishment He could have in Gokula.
