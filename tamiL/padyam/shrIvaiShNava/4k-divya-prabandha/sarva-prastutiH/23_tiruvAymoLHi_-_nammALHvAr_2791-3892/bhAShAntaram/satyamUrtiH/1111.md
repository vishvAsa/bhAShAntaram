**Tamil text and transliteration:**

பண்புடை வண்டொடு தும்பிகாள் பண்மிழற்றேல்மின்  
புண்புரை வேல்கொடு குத்தால்ஒக்கும் நும்இன்குரல்  
தண்பெருநீர்த் தடம்தாமரை மலர்ந்தால்ஒக்கும்  
கண்பெரும்கண்ணன் நம்ஆவிஉண்டுஎழ நண்ணினான்

paṇpuṭai vaṇṭoṭu tumpikāḷ paṇmiḻaṟṟēlmiṉ  
puṇpurai vēlkoṭu kuttālokkum numiṉkural  
taṇperunīrt taṭamtāmarai malarntālokkum  
kaṇperumkaṇṇaṉ namāviuṇṭueḻa naṇṇiṉāṉ

**English translation of verse 9.5.9:**

Ye, humming bees and beetles, Your tone, though sweet,  
Is unto me agonising like the spear, driven into the wound straight,;  
Right-minded that you are, You shall sing no more;  
Of eyes, large and lovely, like the blooming lotus in the pond,  
Kaṇṇaṉ, my Lord, did my life snatch and abscond.

**Notes:**

Fed well on the honey gathered from the flowers in bloom, the sonorous bees hum nicely and it would indeed be a treat to the Nāyakī if she were in the company of her beloved Lord. But now, He is not merely away from her but has also stolen away her heart, by exhibiting His exquisite charm, particularly, His large and lovely eyes like unto the lotus, in fullbloom, in a big pond full of cool water. The Nāyakī finds the humming of the bees quite agonising, in her present state, and appeals to their good sense to desist from humming.
