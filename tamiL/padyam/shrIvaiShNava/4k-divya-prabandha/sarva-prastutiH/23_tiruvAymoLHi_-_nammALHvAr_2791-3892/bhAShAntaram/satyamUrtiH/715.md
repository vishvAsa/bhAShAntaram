பின்னைகொல் நிலமாமகள்கொல்? திருமகள்கொல் பிறந்திட்டாள்,  
என்ன மாயம்கொலோ? இவள் நெடுமால் என்றே நின்று கூவுமால்,  
முன்னி வந்து அவன் நின்று இருந்து உறையும் தொலைவில்லிமங்கலம்-  
சென்னியால் வணங்கும் அவ் ஊர்த் திருநாமம் கேட்பது சிந்தையே.

piṉṉaikol nilamāmakaḷkol? tirumakaḷkol piṟantiṭṭāḷ,  
eṉṉa māyamkolō? ivaḷ neṭumāl eṉṟē niṉṟu kūvumāl,  
muṉṉi vantu avaṉ niṉṟu iruntu uṟaiyum [tolaivillimaṅkalam](/definition/tolaivillimankalam#vaishnavism "show tolaivillimaṅkalam definitions")-  
ceṉṉiyāl vaṇaṅkum av ūrt tirunāmam kēṭpatu cintaiyē.

**English translation of verse 6.5.10:**

Perhaps this lady is Piṇṇai or Nilamakaḻ (Mother Earth), full of grace  
Or Tirumakaḻ ([Mahālakṣmī](/definition/mahalakshmi#vaishnavism "show Mahālakṣmī definitions")) herself, what a wonder it is, she keeps calling out  
Neṭumāl (the all-pervading Lord) and bows before Tolaivillimaṅkalam where He stays,  
And longs to hear the holy name of that place, by others spelt out!

#### Notes

\(i\) Looking at the Nāyakī’s intense longing for Lord [Kṛṣṇa](/definition/krishna#vaishnavism "show Kṛṣṇa definitions"), the mates guess that she might be Nappiṉṉā, reborn; and then, her rapturous [meditation](/definition/meditation#history "show meditation definitions") on the Lord’s advent as [Varāha](/definition/varaha#vaishnavism "show Varāha definitions"), the Great [Boar](/definition/boar#history "show Boar definitions"), makes them inclined to think that she might be an incarnation of Mother Earth. But still, the mates could not make up their minds, as the Nāyakī’s devout contemplation of Lord [Rāmā](/definition/rama#vaishnavism "show Rāmā definitions") suggests the possibility of her being no less than [Sītā](/definition/sita#vaishnavism "show Sītā definitions"), reborn. In his inimitable way, Nampiḷḷai would say that these divine consorts could, in certain respects, be compared to Parāṅkuśa Nāyakī, but she is of such incomparable excellence that one is left wondering whether she has taken this unique [birth](/definition/birth#history "show birth definitions") for the resuscitation of the whole world. What a wonder it is! Of course, anything can take place in the Lord’s Universe.

\(ii\) Her own love for the Lord is of enormous dimensions and yet, the Nāyakī is overwhelmed by the Lord’s love for her and calls Him out, in terms of His tall love, the allconquering.

\(iii\) The Nāyakī loves to hear the name of this pilgrim centre, uttered by some one instead of mouthing it herself. The Lord is said to have come down to Tolaivillimaṅkalam and taken up His residence there, well ahead of the Nāyakī, so as to prepare the ground for the generation, in her, of such intense God-love.
