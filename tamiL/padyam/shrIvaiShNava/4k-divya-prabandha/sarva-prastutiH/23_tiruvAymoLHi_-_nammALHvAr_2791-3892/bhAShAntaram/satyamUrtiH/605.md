**Tamil text and transliteration:**

ஏனம் ஆய் நிலம் கீண்ட என் அப்பனே! கண்ணா! என்றும் என்னை ஆளுடை  
வான நாயகனே! மணி மாணிக்கச்சுடரே  
தேன மாம்பொழில் தண் சிரீவரமங்கலத்தவர் கைதொழ உறை  
வானமாமலையே! அடியேன் தொழ வந்தருளே. (2)

ēṉam āy nilam kīṇṭa eṉ appaṉē! kaṇṇā! eṉṟum eṉṉai āḷuṭai  
vāṉa nāyakaṉē! maṇi māṇikkaccuṭarē  
tēṉa māmpoḻil taṇ cirīvaramaṅkalattavar kaitoḻa uṟai  
vāṉamāmalaiyē! aṭiyēṉ toḻa vantaruḷē. (2)

**English translation of verse 5.7.6:**

Oh, Lord Vāṉamāmalai, reside you do in cool Cirīvaramaṅkai,  
Surrounded by mango-orchards with honey in plenty,  
And adored by its residents; as the Boar huge You pulled  
The Earth out and put it back in its place, my Lord,  
Me you have enlisted as Your vassal, oh Lord of heaven,  
Radiant like gem and ruby, oh, Kaṇṇā, Pray come down  
Unto me here that this vassal may also offer Thee salutation.

#### Notes

\(i\) ‘Vāṉamāmalai’ is alike the name of the Deity and the Pilgrim centre. It means, ‘mountain, sky-high’; so very imposing is the Lord’s Image there indeed and this description fits in admirably.

\(ii\) The Lord’s incarnations are referred to by the Āḻvār, only to remind the Lord of the basic idea, namely, the elevation of the souls down below. ‘Avatāra’ means descent and He comes down to push up the subjects, working like a pulley system. The resuscitation of the Earth from under the waters of the Deluge, the Lord assuming the form of a Boar for this purpose, is specially mentioned by the Āḻvār to remind the Lord that he should also be similarly rescued from the bottomless ocean of Saṃsāra (worldly life).

\(iii\) The Lord is required to walk down to the Āḻvār’s place, for the latter to enjoy His glorious gait.
