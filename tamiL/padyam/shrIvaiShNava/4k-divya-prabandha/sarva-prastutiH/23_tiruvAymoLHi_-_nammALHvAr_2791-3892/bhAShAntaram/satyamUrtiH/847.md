வார்த்தை அறிபவர் மாயவற்கு ஆள்அன்றி ஆவரோ,  
போர்த்த பிறப்பொடு நோயொடு மூப்பொடு இறப்புஇவை  
பேர்த்து, பெரும்துன்பம் வேர்அற நீக்கி தன் தாளின்கீழ்ச்  
சேர்த்து, அவன் செய்யும் சேமத்தைஎண்ணித் தெளிவுற்றே?

**English translation of verse 7.5.10:**

Will those that appreciate the wholesome message  
Of the Lord’s ‘Song Celestial’ and with clarity of mind ponder  
What unto them the Lord has done, the long list of favours,  
Ridding them of the blinding cloak of [birth](/definition/birth#history "show birth definitions"), pestilence, old age  
And [death](/definition/death#history "show death definitions"), [cutting](/definition/cutting#history "show cutting definitions") out, (root and branch), the great disaster,  
(Of getting lost in self-enjoyment) and granting asylum secure  
At His very feet, serve aught but the wondrous Sire?

**Notes:**

\(i\) The quintessence of the Lord’s message in [Bhagavad Gītā](/definition/bhagavad-gita#vaishnavism "show Bhagavad Gītā definitions") is in the ‘Carama [Śloka](/definition/sloka#vaishnavism "show Śloka definitions")’ (XVIII-66), that which treats of the final or the ultimate ‘Means’, the loving path of surrender unto God, taking Him as the Sole Refuge, the ‘Means’ and the ‘End’ combined. This song is virtually a commentary of that Ślokā, vide also the closing aphorism (289) of ‘Mumukṣuppaṭi’ (Lokācārya’s Manual for the seekers of [Mokṣa](/definition/moksha#vaishnavism "show Mokṣa definitions")).

\(ii\) Birth, in the midst of the worldlings with the attendant risk of becoming oblivious of one’s essential [nature](/definition/nature#history "show nature definitions") caught up in a mesh like the [spider](/definition/spider#history "show spider definitions")’s web, sickness which saps one’s energies, the sudden onslaught of old age, like a thunderbolt and the dark hand of death [falling](/definition/falling#history "show falling definitions") on one’s shoulders unawares, are disastrous enough. The greatest disaster of all would, however, be emancipation from the above calamities and staying in a disembodied state, lost in self-enjoyment (known as [Kaivalya](/definition/kaivalya#vaishnavism "show Kaivalya definitions") mokṣa) without tasting the bliss of divine service. It is indeed the greatest of all the favours showered on us by the Lord to wean us away *in toto* from courting this eternal disaster of ‘Kaivalya [anubhava](/definition/anubhava#vaishnavism "show anubhava definitions")’ and vouchsafe unto us the blissful service at His lotus feet, in that Eternal Land ([Heaven](/definition/heaven#history "show Heaven definitions")), with absolutely no risk of our slipping back to the old ways, indeed the greatest of all His benefactions before which all the rest shall pale into insignificance.
