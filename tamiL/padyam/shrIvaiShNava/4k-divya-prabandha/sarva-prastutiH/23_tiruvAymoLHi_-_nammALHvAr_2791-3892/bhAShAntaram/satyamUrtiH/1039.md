**English translation of verse 8.10.5:**

Were I blest by the wondrous Lord to render service eternal  
At His lotus feet lovely, in the yonder land supernal,  
With its whirling splendour in spate and rejoice, would it at all equal  
The rapturous rapport with the devout,  
[Singing](/definition/singing#history "show Singing definitions") in their holy [company](/definition/company#history "show company definitions"), the songs nectarean that sprout.  
From the sweet contemplation of the Lord’s qualities great,  
Albeit possession of the meanest of bodies is my lot?

**Notes:**

The [Āḻvār](/definition/aḻvar#vaishnavism "show Āḻvār definitions") is gradually working up the unique bliss of service unto the Lord’s apostles and Saints and holding a rapport with them, before which even the bliss of eternal service in the yonder [Heaven](/definition/heaven#history "show Heaven definitions"), resplendent with the stream of whirling radiance at the lotus feet of the Lord of transcendent glory, pales into insignificance. In the earlier songs, possession of the wealth of all the three worlds and self-enjoyment in a disembodied state after final emancipation from bodily [bondage](/definition/bondage#history "show bondage definitions"), have been discarded as insignificant nothing, in comparison with the glory of service unto the Lord’s devotees. The Āḻvār does not mind acquiring the meanest of bodies if that would not hamper the joy of his experiencing the Lord’s glory and transmitting it in the form of sweet songs to be sung in the company of the holy men over here. Feeding the devotees with such songs, providing real nourishment to them, is an important facet of service unṭo the devotees. It is, therefore, very appropriate that this aspect finds mention in this decad.
