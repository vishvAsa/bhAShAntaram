**Tamil text and transliteration:**

காட்டி நீ கரந்து உமிழும் நிலம் நீர் தீ விசும்பு கால்,  
ஈட்டி நீ வைத்து அமைத்த இமையோர் வாழ் தனி முட்டைக்,  
கோட்டையினில் கழித்து என்னை உன் கொழும் சோதி உயரத்துக்,  
கூட்டு அரிய திருவடிக்கள் எஞ்ஞான்று கூட்டுதியே?

kāṭṭi nī karantu umiḻum nilam nīr tī vicumpu kāl,  
īṭṭi nī vaittu amaitta imaiyōr vāḻ taṉi muṭṭaik,  
kōṭṭaiyiṉil kaḻittu eṉṉai uṉ koḻum cōti uyarattuk,  
kūṭṭu ariya tiruvaṭikkaḷ eññāṉṟu kūṭṭutiyē?

**English translation of verse 4.9.8:**

My Lord, when will You take me unto Your feet  
In the resplendent heaven, difficult to attain,  
Pulling me out of this fortress the cosmic egg You did ordain  
Out of the elements five, which for a time shone  
Then got inside Your stomach and was then let out?

**Notes:**

\(i\) The Lord tells the Āḻvār that He would certainly fulfil the Āḻvār’s desire. The Āḻvār, however, wants to know when exactly He would do it. The Lord has to set a date for the Āḻvār’s entry into heaven, even as Bharata was assured of Śrī Rāma’s return from exile at the end of fourteen years.

\(ii\) Piḻḻai Tirunarayūr Araiyar is said to have observed that the net woven around each individual soul by the Almighty Lord, in the light of past Karma, has to be disentangled by Him alone, seeing that we are much-too-feeble and cannot disentangle even a bird’s nest. It is a matter of common knowledge that the intricately woven bird’s nest is neatly disentangled by the bird itself and man can, at best only destroy it, if ever he attempted to disentangle the nest. And so, He alone can undo this bondage of ours, and that He will do, when we clasp His holy feet.
