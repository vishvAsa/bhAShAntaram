ஏத்த ஏழ் உலகும் கொண்ட கோலக்  
கூத்தனைக், குருகூர்ச் சடகோபன் சொல்,  
வாய்த்த ஆயிரத்துள் இவை பத்துடன்,  
ஏத்த வல்லவர்க்கு இல்லை ஓர் ஊனமே.

ētta ēḻ ulakum koṇṭa kōlak  
kūttaṉaik, kurukūrc [caṭakōpaṉ](/definition/catakopan#vaishnavism "show caṭakōpaṉ definitions") col,  
vāytta āyirattuḷ ivai pattuṭaṉ,  
ētta vallavarkku illai ōr ūṉamē.

**English translation of verse 2.2.11:**

For those who learn and laud these songs ten,  
Out of the thousand bequeathed unto us, by [Kurukūr](/definition/kurukur#vaishnavism "show Kurukūr definitions") Caṭakōpaṉ,  
In adoration of the enchanting Lord, who did span  
With ease, the worlds seven, drawbacks there will be none.

**Notes**

\(i\) Those, who learn these ten songs and enter into their spirit will be firm in their conviction that [Mahā Viṣṇu](/definition/mahavishnu#vaishnavism "show Mahā Viṣṇu definitions") is the Supreme Lord; they will thus be free from the drawbacks of (i) not looking upon [Mahā](/definition/maha#history "show Mahā definitions") [Viṣṇu](/definition/vishnu#vaishnavism "show Viṣṇu definitions") as the Supreme Lord and (ii) looking upon Deities other than Mahā Viṣṇu, as Supreme, For the matter of that, the solitary episode of [Trivikrama](/definition/trivikrama#vaishnavism "show Trivikrama definitions"), of charming beauty, measuring effortlessly all the worlds in just three strides, is enough to assert Mahā Viṣṇu’s Supremacy.

\(ii\) The Lord’s Supremacy has been set out, in this decad, under various counts, namely, destruction of the sins of devotees and ridding them of distress, being lotuseyed, friend-in-need, achieving the impossible and blending the incompatibles, laudation by the exalted celestials, [Rudra](/definition/rudra#vaishnavism "show Rudra definitions"), [Brahmā](/definition/brahma#vaishnavism "show Brahmā definitions") and others, control of all the three functions of creation, sustentation and dissolution and so on.
