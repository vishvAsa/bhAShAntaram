For the nonce, the [Āḻvār](/definition/aḻvar#vaishnavism "show Āḻvār definitions") attempted to sustain himself by impersonating the Lord, even as the damsels of Vṛndāvan did, during that oppressive break in the middle of the rapturous ‘[Rāsa Krīḍā](/definition/rasakrida#history "show Rāsa Krīḍā definitions")’. But there, Lord [Kṛṣṇa](/definition/krishna#vaishnavism "show Kṛṣṇa definitions") reappeared in an even more enchanting form than in the earlier session. But here, the Lord is still keeping Himself away from the Āḻvār, although, on the previous occasions, He obliged the Āḻvār with His appearance, mental vision of course, whenever the Āḻvār’s longing for such communion was far too intense. Pondering within himself, the Āḻvār apprehends that the Lord might either want him to adopt other means such as [karma](/definition/karma#vaishnavism "show karma definitions"), [Jñāna](/definition/jnana#vaishnavism "show Jñāna definitions"), [Bhakti yogas](/definition/bhaktiyoga#vaishnavism "show Bhakti yogas definitions") or intend to give him up on the ground that he was [pursuing](/definition/pursuing#history "show pursuing definitions") other means, instead of looking upon Him, as the sole Means. The Āḻvār, therefore, hastens to clarify his true stand at the feet of the Lord, enshrined in [Vāṉamāmalai](/definition/vanamamalai#vaishnavism "show Vāṉamāmalai definitions"). This pilgrim centre, also known as (irīvara [Maṅkai](/definition/mamkai#vaishnavism "show Maṅkai definitions"), Cirīvara Maṅkalam and [Nāṅkuṉēri](/definition/nankuneri#vaishnavism "show Nāṅkuṉēri definitions"), is deep south in the [Tamiḻ](/definition/tamil#history "show Tamiḻ definitions") [Nādu](/definition/nadu#history "show Nādu definitions"). In each of the various pilgrim centres, the Lord displays one of His numerous auspicious traits prominently. In Vāṉamāmalai (Cirīvaramaṅkalam) shines, with extra-brilliance, the Lord’s generosity, whereby He gives out to the devotees seeking Him with single-minded devotion, His very feet as their Sole Refuge, (vide aphorism 163 of [Ācārya](/definition/acarya#vaishnavism "show Ācārya definitions") Hṛdayam).
