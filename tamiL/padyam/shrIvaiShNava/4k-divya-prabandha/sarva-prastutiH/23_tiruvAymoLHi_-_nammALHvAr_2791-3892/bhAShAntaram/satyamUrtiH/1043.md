**Tamil text and transliteration:**

தமர்கள் கூட்ட வல்வினையை நாசம் செய்யும் சதுமூர்த்தி  
அமர்கொள் ஆழி சங்குவாள் வில்தண்டுஆதி பல்படையன்  
குமரன் கோல ஐங்கணைவேள்தாதை கோதுஇல் அடியார்தம்  
தமர்கள் தமர்கள் தமர்களாம் சதிரே வாய்க்க தமியேற்கே

tamarkaḷ kūṭṭa valviṉaiyai nācam ceyyum catumūrtti  
amarkoḷ āḻi caṅkuvāḷ viltaṇṭuāti palpaṭaiyaṉ  
kumaraṉ kōla aiṅkaṇaivēḷtātai kōtuil aṭiyārtam  
tamarkaḷ tamarkaḷ tamarkaḷām catirē vāykka tamiyēṟkē

**English translation of verse 8.10.9:**

May this vassal, left alone amidst the worldlings, be blest  
With the bliss of service unto the vassal, who stands last  
In the grand chain of the blemishless devotees of the Lord,  
Who did unto Manmata, perennial youth and exquisite charm impart,  
Who the militant weapons, conch, discus, sword, bow etcetera does wield  
And, with His might unique, rids the enemies tough of His holy band.

**Notes**

\(i\) The Lord destroys *en masse* the entire band of those tough enemies of His devotees. It could also mean destruction of the obstacles confronting the band of devotees as a group or the destruction of the cluster of evils, as and when they crop up.

\(ii\) Even the proverbial youth and handsomeness of Manmata, the deity reputed to be a paragon of beauty, are imparted unto him by the Lord, who is ‘Manmata Manmata’.

\(iii\) Three types of devotees have been mentioned in stanzas 2, 9 and 10 of this decad. In the category of those *exemplary devotees to whom service of the Lord is an end in itself*, alluded to in the 2nd stanza, falls Bharata; in the category of *blemishless devotees who are absolutely selfless*, mentioned in this song, is included Śatrughna, while, in the next category of the *inseparable devotees* who can’t brook separation from the Lord, Lakṣmaṇa is right in the vanguard. Likewise, he, Āḻvār and his associates stand on a pedestal of their own, well apart from the mad pursuits of the worldlings.
