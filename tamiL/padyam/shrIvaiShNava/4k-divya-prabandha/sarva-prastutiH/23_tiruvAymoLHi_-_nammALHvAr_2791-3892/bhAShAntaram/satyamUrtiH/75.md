**[Tamil](/definition/tamil#history "show Tamil definitions") text and transliteration:**

கொள்கை கொளாமை இலாதான் எள்கல் இராகம் இலாதான்  
விள்கை விள்ளாமை விரும்பி உள் கலந்தார்க்கு ஓர் அமுதே.

koḷkai koḷāmai ilātāṉ eḷkal irākam ilātāṉ  
viḷkai viḷḷāmai virumpi uḷ kalantārkku ōr amutē.

**English translation of verse 1.6.5:**

Not given to likes and dislikes, acceptance or rejection,  
Of (service from) devotees, looking to their attainments alone,  
A nectar of incomparable excellence, the Lord is  
Unto those that with Him do mingle, giving up all else.

**Note**

In the preceding song, the [Āḻvār](/definition/aḻvar#vaishnavism "show Āḻvār definitions") presented to us the Lord as One, who would welcome to His benevolent fold every one, without distinction of high and low, seeking His protection. And now, we are told that the Lord is free from likes and dislikes and is, therefore, not prone to extend preferential treatment to some and be indifferent to others on the basis of their individual attainments, while enlisting them in His service. All that He looks for is whether these devotees arc steadfast in their devotion, true to their essential [nature](/definition/nature#history "show nature definitions") of being the objects of His sole enjoyment ([ananya](/definition/ananya#vaishnavism "show ananya definitions") bhōgyatva) or merely seek from Him the fulfilment of their own personal desires, the odds and ends. While the latter class seeking the lesser fruits get what they want and also get parted from the Lord in the bargain, to the former class who stand rivetted to, and nestled, in Him, He is a veritable nectar of incomparable excellence, ever fresh and insatiable.
