**Tamil text and transliteration:**

போனாய் மாமருதின் நடுவே என் பொல்லா மணியே,  
தேனே! இன்அமுதே!' என்று என்றே சில கூத்துச்சொல்ல,  
தானேல் எம்பெருமான் அவன் என் ஆகி ஒழிந்தான்,  
வானே மாநிலமே, மற்றும்முற்றும் என் உள்ளனவே.

pōṉāy māmarutiṉ naṭuvē eṉ pollā maṇiyē,  
tēṉē! iṉamutē!' eṉṟu eṉṟē cila kūttuccolla,  
tāṉēl emperumāṉ avaṉ eṉ āki oḻintāṉ,  
vāṉē mānilamē, maṟṟummuṟṟum eṉ uḷḷaṉavē.

**English translation of verse 5.1.2:**

Shamming deep love, I called out the Lord  
As the One who ‘tween the twin trees crawled,  
My honey, nectar grand, gem of the purest ray serene  
And so on; lo! the Lord and His possessions have now become mine  
And the cosmic duties He carries out from within me.

#### Note

The Divine child (Kṛṣṇa) was tied to a pounder by the Mother, as a punishment. But the child dragged it along and crawled in between two ‘Maruta’ trees and felled them. The Mother grew apprehensive of the safety of the child and it was, therefore, quite all right when she questioned the young one anxiously, ‘Ha! my darling, did you crawl between the trees?’ But the Āḻvār repeats it now, as if he had even a fraction of the concern of the Mother. How pretentious! And yet, the Omniscient Lord has been pleased to take him at his face value and unto him repaired with all His retinue and got inside him. The Āḻvār wonders how this could be. (In him that is charged with God-love, the entire world of God stands illumined. This is now demonstrated.)
