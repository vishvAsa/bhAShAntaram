**[Tamil](/definition/tamil#history "show Tamil definitions") text and transliteration:**

ஆற்ற நல்ல வகை காட்டும் அம்மானை, அமரர்தம்-  
ஏற்றை எல்லாப் பொருளும் விரித்தானை எம்மான் தன்னை,  
மாற்ற மாலைப் புனைந்து ஏத்தி நாளும் மகிழ்வு எய்தினேன்,  
காற்றின் முன்னம் கடுகி வினை நோய்கள் கரியவே.

āṟṟa [nalla](/definition/nalla#history "show nalla definitions") vakai kāṭṭum ammāṉai, amarartam-  
ēṟṟai ellāp poruḷum virittāṉai emmāṉ taṉṉai,  
māṟṟa mālaip puṉaintu ētti nāḷum makiḻvu eytiṉēṉ,  
kāṟṟiṉ muṉṉam kaṭuki viṉai nōykaḷ kariyavē.

**English translation of verse 4.5.5:**

[Singing](/definition/singing#history "show Singing definitions") the praise of my Lord, Chief of Celestials,  
Who does unto His devotees, by stages, reveal  
The wholesome path of progress and knowledge sound impart,  
[Thro](/definition/thro#history "show Thro definitions")’ hymnal garlands that do dense ills and evils cut out,  
Moving faster than wind. I feel for ever jubilant.

**Notes**

\(i\) That the Lord duly regulates the influx of His grace has been brought out at length, in the preamble to 1-9, quoting the relevant aphorism of ‘[Ācārya](/definition/acarya#vaishnavism "show Ācārya definitions")-Hṛdayam’, which elucidates the theme admirably.

\(ii\) *The great truths*: In [Bhagavad Gītā](/definition/bhagavad-gita#vaishnavism "show Bhagavad Gītā definitions") Lord [Kṛṣṇa](/definition/krishna#vaishnavism "show Kṛṣṇa definitions") imparted to the world at large, through [Arjuna](/definition/arjuna#vaishnavism "show Arjuna definitions"), a volume of spiritual-knowledge—the distinction between the Supreme Lord and the Individual Soul ([Jiva](/definition/jiva#vaishnavism "show Jiva definitions")), the difference between the ‘[Jīva](/definition/jiva#vaishnavism "show Jīva definitions")’ and the non-sentient matter, immortality of the Soul, the Lord, as the Supreme Ordainer of all beings and things, controlling motion as well as rest, being easily attainable by devotees but difficult of attainment by others, differentiation between the Divine and the Devilish, equality in the eyes of the Lord, irrespective of caste, conduct and erudition, the path of loving surrender to His redemptive grace and all that.

\(iii\) All these benefits lavished by a loving Lord the [Āḻvār](/definition/aḻvar#vaishnavism "show Āḻvār definitions") could hardly repay, and hence he started lauding His great glory, which laudation assumed the form of ‘[Tiruvāymoḻi](/definition/tiruvaymoli#vaishnavism "show Tiruvāymoḻi definitions")’. Result: The miseries and the acts giving rise to them have all been expelled expeditiously.
