**[Tamil](/definition/tamil#history "show Tamil definitions") text and transliteration:**

தாமோதரனை தனி முதல்வனை ஞாலம் உண்டவனை,  
ஆமோ தரம் அறிய ஒருவர்க்கு? என்றே தொழும் அவர்கள்,  
தாமோதரன் உரு ஆகிய சிவற்கும் திசைமுகற்கும்,  
ஆமோ தரம் அறிய எம்மானை என் ஆழி வண்ணனையே.

tāmōtaraṉai taṉi mutalvaṉai ñālam uṇṭavaṉai,  
āmō taram aṟiya oruvarkku? eṉṟē toḻum avarkaḷ,  
tāmōtaraṉ uru ākiya civaṟkum ticaimukaṟkum,  
āmō taram aṟiya emmāṉai eṉ āḻi vaṇṇaṉaiyē.

**English translation of verse 2.7.12:**

Tāmōtaraṉ, my peerless, primordial Lord,  
Of oceanic hue, who devoured all the worlds,  
Even exalted Ticaimukaṉ ([Brahmā](/definition/brahma#vaishnavism "show Brahmā definitions")) and Civaṉ cannot scan and comprehend,  
Though on His person they stay and worship Him  
And venture to think that they can His glory fathom.

**Note**

The Lord cannot be comprehended through one’s own effort by any one, including the exalted Brahmā and [Śiva](/definition/shiva#vaishnavism "show Śiva definitions"), although they stay right on His body and are inclined to be presumptuous, venturing to attempt the impossible. But He is fully comprehended by the [Āḻvār](/definition/aḻvar#vaishnavism "show Āḻvār definitions") and devotees like him to whom the Lord has, on His own, vouchsafed all that knowledge, clear and concise, full and complete. The Lord who is the causeless cause, the Progenitor of the entire Universe, combines in Him the triple aspects unknown to many, namely, (1) He is the vassal of His devotees, (2) He is the originator of the Universe and (3) the friend-in-need, succouring one and all, in times of distress. Even the Āḻvār cannot fully comprehend the many favours done to him by the Lord, although one so great, had disclosed to the Āḻvār, so low, the vast array of His oceanic traits, like compressing an ocean inside the tiny mustard,
