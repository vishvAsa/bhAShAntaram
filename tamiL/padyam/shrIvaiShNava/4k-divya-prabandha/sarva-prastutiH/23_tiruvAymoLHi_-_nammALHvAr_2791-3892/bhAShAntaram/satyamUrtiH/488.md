**[Tamil](/definition/tamil#history "show Tamil definitions") text and transliteration:**

கண்டுகொண்டு என் கைகள் ஆர நின் திருப்பாதங்கள்மேல்,  
எண் திசையும் உள்ள பூக்கொண்டு ஏத்தி உகந்து உகந்து,  
தொண்டரோங்கள் பாடி ஆட சூழ் கடல் ஞாலத்துள்ளே,  
வண் துழாயின் கண்ணி வேந்தே! வந்திடகில்லாயே.

kaṇṭukoṇṭu eṉ kaikaḷ āra niṉ tiruppātaṅkaḷmēl,  
eṇ ticaiyum uḷḷa pūkkoṇṭu ētti ukantu ukantu,  
toṇṭarōṅkaḷ [pāṭi](/definition/pati#vaishnavism "show pāṭi definitions") āṭa cūḻ kaṭal ñālattuḷḷē,  
vaṇ tuḻāyiṉ [kaṇṇi](/definition/kanni#history "show kaṇṇi definitions") vēntē! vantiṭakillāyē.

**English translation of verse 4.7.8:**

Oh, Sovereign Master, bedecked with tuḷaci garlands comely.  
Why don’t you appear before me in this very land,  
By ocean surrounded, that I can feast on Your Form lovely,  
Gather choice flowers from everywhere and with my hands  
Offer them lustily at Your holy feet and laud you in a chorus,  
[Singing](/definition/singing#history "show Singing definitions") and [dancing](/definition/dancing#history "show dancing definitions") with delight immense?

**Note**

Having enumerated in the preceding song, the favours already received by him from the Lord, the [Āḻvār](/definition/aḻvar#vaishnavism "show Āḻvār definitions") now lists out what he stills needs from Him. The eyes, hitherto starved, must feast on His nectarean charm, the hands which remained idle so far, should be fully engaged in [gathering](/definition/gathering#history "show gathering definitions") flowers from all the eight directions and offering them at the feet of the Lord to his heart’s content; seeing the Lord’s delight, he and his fellow-devotees should give vent to their joy, singing and dancing. Without deferring all this enjoyment till he reaches [heaven](/definition/heaven#history "show heaven definitions"), he should be enabled to have it all, right here. When one feels enormously thirsty, the thirst needs to be quenched there and then; there is hardly any point in extending a promise to relieve the thirst some time later, at some other place. The Lord is required to present Himself before the Āḻvār, right here, in all that heavenly splendour, which is precisely what the Celestials drink deep all the time. This, he has been praying for, since long, and yet, the Lord hasn’t responded. This sums up the present plight of the Āḻvār.
