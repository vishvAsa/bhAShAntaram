தான் ஓர் உருவே தனிவித்தாய் தன்னின் மூவர் முதலாய  
வானோர் பலரும் முனிவரும் மற்றும் மற்றும் முற்றும் ஆய்  
தான் ஓர் பெருநீர் தன்னுள்ளே தோற்றி அதனுள் கண்வளரும்  
வானோர் பெருமான் மா மாயன் வைகுந்தன் எம் பெருமானே.

**Preamble**

Finding the [Āḻvār](/definition/aḻvar#vaishnavism "show Āḻvār definitions"), a little less scared of the Lord’s exaltation than a little while ago, some persons asked him what exactly he was intending to do, whether to get near the Lord or get away from Him. This stanza provides the answer to this question, real or supposed.

The Āḻvār says:

> “Even if I wish to keep aloof, my Lord would not give me up. Look at > His condescending love of amazing dimensions. The great Creator of all > the worlds and all classes of sentient and non-sentient beings, the > Supreme Master of all, including the celestials in the High > [Heaven](/definition/heaven#history "show Heaven definitions"), above > wants of any kind, reclining on the bosom of the vast expanse of water > in [Yoga](/definition/yoga#vaishnavism "show Yoga definitions") nidrā, > is now tight here to claim me as His inalienable property”.

**English translation of verse 1.5.4:**

The Supreme Lord beside whom there was none.  
Created the first three ([Brahmā](/definition/brahma#vaishnavism "show Brahmā definitions"), [Śiva](/definition/shiva#vaishnavism "show Śiva definitions") and [Indra](/definition/indra#vaishnavism "show Indra definitions")), this, that and the other,  
([Devas](/definition/deva#vaishnavism "show Devas definitions"), Sages, men, [birds](/definition/bird#history "show birds definitions"), [beasts](/definition/beast#history "show beasts definitions") and all) with no *external aid* (i) whatever  
And reposed (in Yoga nidra) on the vast expanse of water,  
He had raised; the wondrous Lord, Chief of celestials, Vaikuntaṉ, is also my *Master* (ii).

**Notes**

\(i\) The Lord is at once the *Material* ([Upādāna](/definition/upadana#vaishnavism "show Upādāna definitions")) cause, *Operative* ([nimitta](/definition/nimitta#history "show nimitta definitions")) cause and *Instrumental or efficient* (Sahakāri) cause of Creation.

\(ii\) This is the key word for this stanza. The Master has come to reclaim His property (the Āḻvār) and He shall not be a [party](/definition/party#history "show party definitions") to its slipping through the fingers.
