புண்ணியம் செய்து நல்ல புனலொடு மலர்கள்தூவி  
எண்ணுமின் எந்தைநாமம் இப்பிறப்புஅறுக்கும் அப்பால்  
திண்ணம்நாம் அறியச்சொன்னோம் செறிபொழில் அனந்தபுரத்து  
அண்ணலார் கமலபாதம் அணுகுவார் அமரர்ஆவார்

**English translation of verse 10.2.5:**

Meditate on the holy names of our Lord  
And unto Him offer with devotion supreme,  
Water, pure and simple, and flowers fine, to get rid  
Of this fell [bondage](/definition/bondage#history "show bondage definitions") of [Saṃsāra](/definition/samsara#history "show Saṃsāra definitions"); let me affirm,  
Those that get near the lotus feet of our Sire  
At [Aṉantapuram](/definition/anantapuram#vaishnavism "show Aṉantapuram definitions"), with many a garden fine,  
Are as good as the Eternal Angels in [Heaven](/definition/heaven#history "show Heaven definitions").

**Notes:**

The [Āḻvār](/definition/aḻvar#vaishnavism "show Āḻvār definitions") exhorts the people to approach the Lord at Aṉantapuram and adore His lotus feet, affirming that, by so doing, they will rise to the stature of the ‘[Nitya](/definition/nitya#vaishnavism "show Nitya definitions") [Sūrīs](/definition/suri#history "show Sūrīs definitions")’ in Heaven. By sacramental water for the Lord’s worship is meant only water, pure and simple, and not the one spiced and flavoured with cloves and cardamoms, the emphasis being on the easy worshippability of the Lord. Mere [meditation](/definition/meditation#history "show meditation definitions") on the holy names of the Lord will grind to a halt the dreadful cycle of [birth](/definition/birth#history "show birth definitions") and [death](/definition/death#history "show death definitions"). There is also no restriction whatsoever, in regard to the persons eligible to indulge in meditation. All that is needed is the mere desire to spell out the Lord’s holy names. There is scarcely a felicity which the recital of the holy names does not confer and he, who seeks separate means to enable him to recite the Lord’s names, is as ludicrous as the one attempting to cleanse himself in a petty pool of brackish water, preparatory to having a dip in the holy [Ganga](/definition/ganga#vaishnavism "show Ganga definitions"), as the illustrious Bhaṭṭārya would put it. When a man stumbles on the [road](/definition/road#history "show road definitions"), at once he cries out “[Ammā](/definition/amma#history "show Ammā definitions")!” To cry so, is any qualification needed? No; even so, no special qualification is needed to recite the Lord’s holy names.
