**[Tamil](/definition/tamil#history "show Tamil definitions") text and transliteration:**

ஏழையர் ஆவிஉண்ணும் இணைக் கூற்றம்கொலோ அறியேன்,  
ஆழிஅம் கண்ணபிரான் திருக்கண்கள் கொலோ அறியேன்,  
சூழவும் தாமரை நாள்மலர் போல் வந்து தோன்றும்கண்டீர்,  
தோழியர்காள்! அன்னைமீர்! என்செய்கேன் துயராட்டியேனே? (2)

ēḻaiyar āviuṇṇum iṇaik kūṟṟamkolō aṟiyēṉ,  
āḻiam kaṇṇapirāṉ tirukkaṇkaḷ kolō aṟiyēṉ,  
cūḻavum tāmarai nāḷmalar pōl vantu tōṉṟumkaṇṭīr,  
tōḻiyarkāḷ! aṉṉaimīr! eṉceykēṉ tuyarāṭṭiyēṉē? (2)

**English translation of verse 7.7.1:**

Ye, mates and elders, I know not whether what I see  
Are [death](/definition/death#history "show death definitions")-[dealing](/definition/dealing#history "show dealing definitions") twins or the lovely eyes of Kaṇṇapirāṉ, the sea-hued Lord;  
Know ye that these are by me seen all around  
Like lotus flowers in full bloom, tormenting poor me  
And women-folks; how can I get over my distress indeed?

**Notes:**

Of all the limbs of the Lord, His lotus eyes, which kept the [Āḻvār](/definition/aḻvar#vaishnavism "show Āḻvār definitions") dumbfounded, presented themselves before him first, because it was the Lord’s bewitching eyes that attracted the Āḻvār unto Him, as confessed by him in the first of his four hymnals (*[Tiruviruttam](/definition/tiruviruttam#vaishnavism "show Tiruviruttam definitions")*). But then, why should he feel tormented by the vision instead of being delighted? Had the Lord’s Form, as a whole, been perceived by him, surely, he would have revelled in that glorious vision. But now, the Lord would appear to indulge in some cruel fun at the expense of the Āḻvār, by showing him His limbs, one by one, and watching his reaction thereto. The Āḻvār exclaims that these very eyes that attract the women-folks, could also prove fatal if their ardent aspirations to enjoy Him, roused by these eyes, are not fulfilled betimes. And again, being seen all round like lotus in full bloom, they oppress him without leaving him any chance to miss it by turning his attention elsewhere. Indeed the Lord’s bewitching eyes would cast their spell on the Lord Himself if only He beheld them in a mirror.
