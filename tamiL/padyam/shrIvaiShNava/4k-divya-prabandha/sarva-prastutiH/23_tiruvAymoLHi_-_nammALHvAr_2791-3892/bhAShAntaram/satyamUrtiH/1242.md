**[Tamil](/definition/tamil#history "show Tamil definitions") text and transliteration:**

சாரா ஏதங்கள் நீரார் முகில்வண்ணன்  
பேர் ஆர் ஓதுவார் ஆரார் அமரரே.

[cārā](/definition/cara#history "show cārā definitions") ētaṅkaḷ nīrār mukilvaṇṇaṉ  
pēr ār ōtuvār ārār amararē.

**English translation of verse 10.5.8:**

Those that chant the holy names of the [cloud](/definition/cloud#history "show cloud definitions")-hued Lord,  
Whatever might be their descent and deeds,  
Shall well be beyond the reach of evil  
And be on a par with the redoubted Celestials.

**Notes:**

That there is no restriction whatsoever, conditioning one’s eligibility to chant the Lord’s names, is clearly brought out, in this song. Whosoever chants the holy names of the Lord, of enchanting complexion, shall not only be beyond the reach of evil of any kind but shall also be on a par with the exalted Celestials. The mere sight of the cloud-hued Lord is so exhilarating that it cannot but tempt the beholders to utter His holy names, over and over again. Irrespective of their parentage and occupation, those that recite the Lord’s glorious names acquire a stature equal to that of the Celestials who subsist solely on divine service.
