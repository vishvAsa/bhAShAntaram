**[Tamil](/definition/tamil#history "show Tamil definitions") text and transliteration:**

போகு நம்பீ உன் தாமரைபுரை கண் இணையும் செவ்வாய் முறுவலும்  
ஆகுலங்கள் செய்ய அழிதற்கே நோற்றோமேயாம்?  
தோகை மாமயிலார்கள் நின் அருள் சூடுவார் செவி ஓசை வைத்து எழ  
ஆகள் போகவிட்டு குழல் ஊது போயிருந்தே.

pōku nampī uṉ tāmaraipurai kaṇ iṇaiyum cevvāy muṟuvalum  
ākulaṅkaḷ ceyya aḻitaṟkē nōṟṟōmēyām?  
tōkai māmayilārkaḷ niṉ aruḷ cūṭuvār cevi ōcai vaittu eḻa  
ākaḷ pōkaviṭṭu kuḻal ūtu pōyiruntē.

**English translation of verse 6.2.2:**

Get thee gone, oh. Sire; we womenfolk seem born to dwindle  
Under the spell of Your lotus eyes and bewitching smiles  
On Your red lips, better go and graze the cows,  
Playing the flute from behind unto the recipients of Your love  
Having locks lovely like the spread-out plumes of the [peacock](/definition/peacock#history "show peacock definitions").

#### Note

When asked by the Nāyakī to get away, the Lord entered into an argument with her, saying that she could not claim ownership of the games materials and that apart, it would be most uncharitable on her part to expel Him who had come over to her, out of deep love. The [Lover](/definition/lover#history "show Lover definitions") advanced towards the Nāyakī with bewitching smile and sweet glances but the Nāyakī, still smarting under a sense of deliberate neglect by the Lover, observed that His smiles and glances actually sapped her and other women, unfortunate like her, rather than sustain and bade Him to keep grazing the cows and playing the flute for the delectation of the lucky damsels of [Gokula](/definition/gokula#vaishnavism "show Gokula definitions"), the recipients of His favours, with lovely locks. The description of the lovely locks of the Lover’s favourites given here, initially came from His lips, complimenting the Nāyakī but she would not acknowledge it and she spitefully turned it on to those other ladies, basking in the sunshine of His love.
