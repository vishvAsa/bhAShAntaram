**Tamil text and transliteration:**

பிறந்த ஆறும் வளர்ந்த ஆறும் பெரிய பாரதம் கைசெய்து ஐவர்க்குத்-  
திறங்கள் காட்டியிட்டுச் செய்து போன மாயங்களும்  
நிறம் தன் ஊடு புக்கு எனது ஆவியை நின்று நின்று உருக்கி உண்கின்ற இச்-  
சிறந்தவான் சுடரே! உன்னை என்றுகொல் சேர்வதுவே! (2)

piṟanta āṟum vaḷarnta āṟum periya pāratam kaiceytu aivarkkut-  
tiṟaṅkaḷ kāṭṭiyiṭṭuc ceytu pōṉa māyaṅkaḷum  
niṟam taṉ ūṭu pukku eṉatu āviyai niṉṟu niṉṟu urukki uṇkiṉṟa ic-  
ciṟantavāṉ cuṭarē! uṉṉai eṉṟukol cērvatuvē! (2)

**English translation of verse 5.10.1:**

Oh, Lord of radiance beyond measure, The manner of Your birth,  
The manner You grew up, Your wondrous military strategy  
In the great battle of Bhārata leading the five to victory,  
And Your return to Celestium thereafter, all these, taking one’s breath,  
Get into the vital region of my heart, sapping my soul  
All the time; when indeed will You be joined by this vassal?

#### Note

After briefly touching upon the Lord’s Avatāra as Śrī Kṛṣṇa, the Āḻvār deplores his inability to remain steady and recount His wonderful deeds, as they send him into a trance, touching as they do the inner core of his being. As a matter of fact, even as he contemplated the manner of the Lord’s birth as Kṛṣṇa, entering the mother’s womb as we, bound souls do, he fell into a trance which lasted six months. This song did not, therefore, progress beyond the opening phrase, ‘the manner of Your birth’ (as in the original text), for six months. Then again, he was struck by the way Kṛṣṇa grew up, how He was shifted from the place of birth the same night and brought up by a different set of parents, under cover, the odds and ends He had to contend against, right from infancy, the many miracles He wrought in the battle that ensued between the Pāṇḍavas and Kauravas, after His peace-parleys proved abortive, His functioning as Arujuna’s charioteer and so on. Briefly put, in the inimitable language of Īṭu, the way Kaṇṇaṉ grew up was precisely the way the inimical ones were made to eat the dust and the friendly ones drank deep of His nectarean charm (a continual feast for their eyes), gobbling up ghee and other milk products stored up in the pastoral township of Tiruvāyppāṭi (Gokula).
