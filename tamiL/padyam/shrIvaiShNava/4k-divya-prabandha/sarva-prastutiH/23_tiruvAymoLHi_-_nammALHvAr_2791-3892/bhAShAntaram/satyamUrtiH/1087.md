**English translation of verse 9.3.11:**

‘Tis but natural that those somehow associated with these songs ten,  
Out of the thousand, in the hymnal garland of [Kurukūr](/definition/kurukur#vaishnavism "show Kurukūr definitions") Caṭakōpān,  
Adoring the feet of the Lord of loving condescension  
And boundless compassion, do ascend the high [Heaven](/definition/heaven#history "show Heaven definitions").

**Notes:**

\(i\) This decad is in adoration of the Lord’s loving condescension which knows no limits. The Supreme Lord, higher than whom there is none, freely mingles, without any qualms, compunction or mental reservation, with the lowest of the lowly.

\(ii\) Contemplating the Lord’s grace galore, the [Āḻvār](/definition/aḻvar#vaishnavism "show Āḻvār definitions") also goes to the extent of asserting that even those, who are in some way, however remote, associated with these ten songs, will ascend the high Heaven, as a matter of course. It is not necessary that one should get these songs by wrote of heart or delve deep into their meanings for reaping the benefit of natural entry into Heaven, set out in this decad. It will suffice if one manages to remain in the place where these songs are sung, no matter even if one is inclined to doze about and gets actually landed in sleep. Even for such a person, Heaven becomes, as it were, the heir-loom, as Nampiḷḷai puts it, by way of driving home the benefit, spelt out in this end-song.
