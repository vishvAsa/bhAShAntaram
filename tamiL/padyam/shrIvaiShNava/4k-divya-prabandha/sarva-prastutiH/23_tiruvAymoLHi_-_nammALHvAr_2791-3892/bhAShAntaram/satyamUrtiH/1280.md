**[Tamil](/definition/tamil#history "show Tamil definitions") text and transliteration:**

உண்டு களித்தேற்கு உம்பர்என் குறை மேலைத்-  
தொண்டு உகளித்து அந்தி தொழும் சொல்லுப் பெற்றேன்  
வண்டு களிக்கும் பொழில்சூழ் திருப்பேரான்  
கண்டு களிப்ப கண்ணுள்நின்று அகலானே.

uṇṭu kaḷittēṟku umpareṉ kuṟai mēlait-  
toṇṭu ukaḷittu anti toḻum collup peṟṟēṉ  
vaṇṭu kaḷikkum poḻilcūḻ tiruppērāṉ  
kaṇṭu kaḷippa kaṇṇuḷniṉṟu akalāṉē.

**English translation of verse 10.8.7:**

My Sire, Who dwells in Tiruppēr with its orchards fine,  
Where bees, fed on honey, go gay, stays in my view all the time,  
For my eyes to feast upon; unto me thus happily fed  
What is there in [heaven](/definition/heaven#history "show heaven definitions") to enjoy? I have tasted  
The bliss of service supreme and to its acme am I led  
[Uttering](/definition/uttering#history "show Uttering definitions") the word ‘[namaḥ](/definition/nama#vaishnavism "show namaḥ definitions")’ to show that unto Him I belong.

**Notes:**

\(i\) Having tasted the supreme bliss of service unto the Lord, right here, by [singing](/definition/singing#history "show singing definitions") these love-laden songs, ([Tiruvāymoḻi](/definition/tiruvaymoli#vaishnavism "show Tiruvāymoḻi definitions")), the [Āḻvār](/definition/aḻvar#vaishnavism "show Āḻvār definitions") is led to pause and think what more could there be for him to enjoy on the yonder side of Heaven. Uttering the word ‘namaḥ’ or worship of the Lord, betokening one’s realisation of the true [nature](/definition/nature#history "show nature definitions") of the soul that one is the exclusive vassal of the Lord, totally dependent on and belonging to Him, is the logical culmination of the enjoyment of the bliss of Divine Service (kaiṅkarya [rasa](/definition/rasa#vaishnavism "show rasa definitions")) “[Nama](/definition/nama#vaishnavism "show Nama definitions") ityeva vādhinaḥ”, Such a realisation having also dawned on the Āḻvār, what more does he need?

\(ii\) The Lord is now feasted upon continually, by the Āḻvār’s eyes which languished before, for want of this glorious vision. What is even more astounding is His firm hold on the heart of the Āḻvār. It is but natural that the Āḻvār rejoices, recounting all this felicity heaped on him by the Lord, madly in love with him.
