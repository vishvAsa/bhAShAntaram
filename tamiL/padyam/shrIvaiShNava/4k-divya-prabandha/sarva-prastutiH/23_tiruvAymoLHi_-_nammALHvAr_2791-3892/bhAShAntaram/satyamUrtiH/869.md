**Tamil text and transliteration:**

உய்விடம் ஏழையர்க்கும் அசுரர்க்கும் அரக்கர்கட்கும்  
எவ்விடம் என்றுஇலங்கி மகரம் தழைக்கும் தளிர்கொல்,  
பைவிடப் பாம்புஅணையான் திருக்குண்டலக் காதுகளே?  
கைவிடல் ஒன்றும்இன்றி அடுகின்றன காண்மின்களே

uyviṭam ēḻaiyarkkum acurarkkum arakkarkaṭkum  
evviṭam eṉṟuilaṅki makaram taḻaikkum taḷirkol,  
paiviṭap pāmpuaṇaiyāṉ tirukkuṇṭalak kātukaḷē?  
kaiviṭal oṉṟumiṉṟi aṭukiṉṟaṉa kāṇmiṉkaḷē

**English translation of verse 7.7.6:**

Are these the leaves fish-shaped? No, these are the ears,  
Bedecked with rings, studded with pearls, of the Lord Who has  
As His bed, the hooded serpent poisonous, which finish off alike  
Womenfolks, asuras and demons and torment me with no break.

**Notes:**

The ears of the Lord leave no chance of survival for the Asuras and Rākṣasas who will die of jealousy on beholding the charming lobes, and again, the weaker sex (women) would pine for the Lord and collapse due to the non-fulfilment of their aspirations. The Āḻvār feels tormented because he could not enjoy the Lord there and then, much as he pined for such enjoyment. It is not merely the natural charm of the Lord’s ear-lobes that torments the Nāyakī but it stands heightened by the pearls worn on them and the back-drop of Ādiśeṣa on whom the Lord is reclining. So then, the poignancy of oppression from this source makes the earlier tormenters pale into insignificance, and they even appear comparatively as benefactors like charitable persons setting up booths to quench the thirst of the weary sojourners.
