யானும் நீதானே ஆவதோமெய்யே அருநரகுஅவையும் நீ ஆனால்  
வான்உயர் இன்பம் எய்தில்என் மற்றை நரகமே எய்தில்என்? எனினும்,  
யானும் நீதானாய்த் தெளிதொறும், நன்றும் அஞ்சுவன் நரகம் நான்அடைதல்  
வான்உயர்இன்பம் மன்னிவீற்றிருந்தாய் அருளுநின் தாள்களைஎனக்கே.

**English translation of verse 8.1.9:**

True it is, You are in me as You are in everything else,  
The [hell](/definition/hell#history "show hell definitions") of a [life](/definition/life#history "show life definitions") I now eke out is also Yours;  
So then, it matters not whether You grant me heavenly bliss  
Or keep me lingering in this hellish life, full of distress.  
And yet, life here I dread when I do my essential [nature](/definition/nature#history "show nature definitions") realise,  
I beseech you. therefore, oh Lord, [seated](/definition/seat#history "show seated definitions") in the blissful [heaven](/definition/heaven#history "show heaven definitions")!  
To bless me that I do your lovely feet attain.

**Notes:**

To those gifted with the vision of the Lord’s Universal Form ([Viśvarūpa](/definition/vishvarupa#vaishnavism "show Viśvarūpa definitions")), like [Prahlāda](/definition/prahlada#vaishnavism "show Prahlāda definitions") and [Nammāḻvār](/definition/nammalvar#vaishnavism "show Nammāḻvār definitions"), it should indeed be possible to perceive the presence of the Lord everywhere, looking upon Hell and Heaven alike, with perfect mental equanimity. The [doubt](/definition/doubt#history "show doubt definitions"), therefore, arises why the [Āḻvār](/definition/aḻvar#vaishnavism "show Āḻvār definitions") abhors existence over here and aspires for his ascent to Heaven, exhibiting a distinct predilection for the latter. This song clears up the position in this regard. It is the corroding, rather, the corrupting influence of life in the midst of the worldlings with its potential risk of seriously interfering with his essential nature, as the exclusive vassal of the Lord solely dependent on Him, that scares the Āḻvār and frightens him to such an extent. No wonder, therefore that he longs for his quick ascent to Heaven where the Lord can be served and enjoyed in that transcendent setting, without break and [fear](/definition/fear#history "show fear definitions") of contamination of any sort.
