**Tamil text and transliteration:**

எளிவரும் இயல்வினன் நிலை வரம்பு இல பல பிறப்பாய்  
ஒளிவரும் முழு நலம் முதல் இல கேடு இல வீடு ஆம்  
தெளிதரும் நிலைமையது ஒழிவு இலன் முழுவதும்; இறையோன்  
அளிவரும் அருளினோடு அகத்தனன் புறத்தனன் அமைந்தே.

eḷivarum iyalviṉaṉ nilai varampu ila pala piṟappāy  
oḷivarum muḻu nalam mutal ila kēṭu ila vīṭu ām  
teḷitarum nilaimaiyatu oḻivu ilaṉ muḻuvatum; iṟaiyōṉ  
aḷivarum aruḷiṉōṭu akattaṉaṉ puṟattaṉaṉ amaintē.

**English translation of verse 1.3.2:**

[Preamble:]—Tradition has it that Śrī Matura Kavi and several other savants, who had the great good fortune of listening to ‘Tiruvāymoḻi’ from the sacred lips of the Āḻvār, gathered round the insensate Āḻvār and eagerly awaited his return to his senses. It was after the lapse of a period of six months, that the Āḻvār recovered himself, took up the thread where he had left it and proceeded to expatiate on the Lord’s aforesaid ‘Saulabhya’ (easy accessibility) by saying that He is simplicity itself (simplicity personified).

**Translation**

The Lord is the very personification of simplicity, which helps all His numerous auspicious qualities, without beginning or end, shine forth; having made innumerable descents without restriction of manner of birth and place of descent, it is always the Lord’s prerogative to grant that cleansed and clarified state (known as ‘*Mokṣa*’). Shedding, with sweet spontaniety, His unlimited grace unto the devotees (and doing even odd jobs for them) He is beyond the reach of others (the inimical).
