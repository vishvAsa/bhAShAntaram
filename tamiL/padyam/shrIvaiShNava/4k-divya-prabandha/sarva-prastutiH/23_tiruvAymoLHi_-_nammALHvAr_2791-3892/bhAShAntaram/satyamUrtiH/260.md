**Tamil text and transliteration:**

கரும வன் பாசம் கழித்து உழன்று உய்யவே,  
பெருமலை எடுத்தான் பீடு உறை கோயில்,  
வரு மழை தவழும் மாலிருஞ்சோலைத்,  
திருமலை அதுவே அடைவது திறமே.

karuma vaṉ pācam kaḻittu uḻaṉṟu uyyavē,  
perumalai eṭuttāṉ pīṭu uṟai kōyil,  
varu maḻai tavaḻum māliruñcōlait,  
tirumalai atuvē aṭaivatu tiṟamē.

**English translation of verse 2.10.4:**

Going over to Māliruñ cōlai is real good,  
Where the rain-clouds crawl and dwells the Lord  
For ever, for us to serve Him and get undone  
Our ‘*Kārmik*’ bonds tough; His person does the glory beam  
Of His great deliverance of Mount (Govardhan)

**Note**

To extricate ourselves from the otherwise inextricable bondage of ‘Karma’ and to serve the Lord, the Āḻvār deems it but proper that we should reach this sacred hill where the Lord stays for ever, with great delight. That He is the great deliverer is writ large on the person of Lord Aḻakar enshrined there, proclaiming His great glory as the deliverer of the inhabitants of the pastoral village of Gokula from the fury of Indra, by holding aloft Mount Govardhana for a whole week during His Avatāra as Kṛṣṇa.
