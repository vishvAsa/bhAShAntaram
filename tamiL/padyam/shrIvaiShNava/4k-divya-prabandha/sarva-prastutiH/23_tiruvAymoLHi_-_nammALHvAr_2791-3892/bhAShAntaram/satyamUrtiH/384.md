**Tamil text and transliteration:**

வாய்கொண்டு மானிடம் பாடவந்த கவியேன் அல்லேன்.  
ஆய்கொண்ட சீர்வள்ளல் ஆழிப் பிரான் எனக்கே உளன்,  
சாய் கொண்ட இம்மையும் சாதித்து வானவர் நாட்டையும்,  
நீ கண்டுகொள் என்று வீடும் தரும் நின்றுநின்றே!

vāykoṇṭu māṉiṭam pāṭavanta kaviyēṉ allēṉ.  
āykoṇṭa cīrvaḷḷal āḻip pirāṉ eṉakkē uḷaṉ,  
cāy koṇṭa immaiyum cātittu vāṉavar nāṭṭaiyum,  
nī kaṇṭukoḷ eṉṟu vīṭum tarum niṉṟuniṉṟē!

**English translation of verse 3.9.9:**

I am not the poet born to extol the frail humans,  
My tongue shall praise only the Lord holding the discus,  
The Donor great, full of qualities auspicious,  
Who presents Himself here in iconic Form delicious  
And grants heavenly bliss in due course.

**Notes**

\(i\) The Āḻvār will not sing the praise of any but the extremely generous Lord. Although several Sages and Saints including the other Āḻvārs have sung the Lord’s glory, Nammāḻvār’s poems are hymns with a difference, of peerless excellence.

\(ii\) Although the Āḻvār has expressed his abhorrence of this hairowing abode with its evil propensities, in several places, earlier, he does not mind eking cut his stay here, because of the Lord’s living presence, right here, in His iconic Form, a bliss which compares favourable with, rather excels, heavenly bliss. As a matter of fact, the Āḻvār asked the Lord in stanza 53 of ‘Periya Tituvantāti’ whether the heavenly bliss which He grants, is by-any-means superior to the sweet contemplation of His infinite glory.

\(iii\) *In due course*: Nampiḷḷai is of the view that the heavenly bliss is granted by the Lord duly regulated with regard to the capacity of the recipient, just like a person who has been on a month-long fast, breaking the fast by stages before he resumes the normal in-take of food. This theme has already been elaborated upon, in the preamble to 1-9. Other commentators have, however, interpreted the corresponding phrase in the original text of this stanza as ‘In due course’, that is, at the appropriate time.
