**Tamil text and transliteration:**

திண்ணன் வீடு முதல் முழுதும் ஆய்,  
எண்ணின் மீதியன் எம் பெருமான்,  
மண்ணும் விண்ணும் எல்லாம் உடன் உண்ட, நம்  
கண்ணன் கண் அல்லது இல்லை ஓர் கண்ணே.

tiṇṇaṉ vīṭu mutal muḻutum āy,  
eṇṇiṉ mītiyaṉ em perumāṉ,  
maṇṇum viṇṇum ellām uṭaṉ uṇṭa, nam  
kaṇṇaṉ kaṇ allatu illai ōr kaṇṇē.

**English translation of verse 2.2.1:**

There is no God other than my Sire, Kaṇṇaṉ,  
(Whose traits and possessions) defy enumeration,  
The granter of ‘Mokṣa’, the supreme bliss firm and fine,  
Who at once ate up all the worlds, for their sustentation.

**Note**

The Āḻvār affirms that Lord Kṛṣṇa who enthralled him by His innumerable auspicious traits, is the Supreme Lord of the whole Universe, the granter of Mokṣa, the final bliss. During the period of deluge, He did sustain all the worlds by keeping them within His stomach and this is referred to here, as His having eaten them up. This ‘eating up’ actually connotes that the Lord sustains the worlds and their contents within His stomach with the same relish as one has for food. The minor deities, Brahmā, Rudra and others, are also among those, so sustained by the Lord. Need it be specifically said that the one who sustains is superior to those sustained?
