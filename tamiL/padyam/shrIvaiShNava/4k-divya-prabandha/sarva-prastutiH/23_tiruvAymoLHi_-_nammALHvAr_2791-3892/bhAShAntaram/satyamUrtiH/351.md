**Tamil text and transliteration:**

ஆளும் பரமனை கண்ணனை ஆழிப் பிரான் தன்னை,  
தோளும் ஓர் நான்கு உடைத் தூமணி வண்ணன் எம்மான்தன்னை  
தாளும் தடக் கையும் கூப்பிப் பணியும் அவர் கண்டீர்,  
நாளும் பிறப்பிடைதோறு எம்மை ஆளுடை நாதரே.

āḷum paramaṉai kaṇṇaṉai āḻip pirāṉ taṉṉai,  
tōḷum ōr nāṉku uṭait tūmaṇi vaṇṇaṉ emmāṉtaṉṉai  
tāḷum taṭak kaiyum kūppip paṇiyum avar kaṇṭīr,  
nāḷum piṟappiṭaitōṟu emmai āḷuṭai nātarē.

**English translation of verse 3.7.2:**

They are the Masters that enslave me daily and life after life,  
Who do with joined palms and legs, prostrate  
Unto Kaṇṇaṉ, the Lord Supreme, the Benefactor great,  
Holding the discus, of the hue of blue gem immaculate,  
With peerless shoulders four, the reigning Chief.

**Notes**

\(i\) The Āḻvār affirms that those that are swayed by the Lord’s exquisite charm, in all its details, are his perennial masters.

\(ii\) *Reigning Chief*: If the Lord’s devotees are the Āḻvār’s masters, how could the Lord be called the reigning Chief? This *prima facie* contradiction is resolved by holding that the Lord’s reign over His subjects is directed towards reclaiming them and enlisting them in the service of His devotees. Right in the opening line of the first of his ten scintillating stanzas, Tiruppāṇ Āḻvār depicts this special feature of the Lord.

\(iii\) *Lord Kaṇṇaṉ*: By His devoted service unto His elder brother Balarāma, a reincarnation of Ādiśeṣa, Śrī Kṛṣṇa has demonstrated the importance of service unto devotees.

\(iv\) *The Shoulders four*: The Lord doles out the four ‘Puruṣārtas’, the ultimate values, as elected by the votaries, with His four arms, one for each. Once, when Śrī Parāśara Bhaṭṭar happened to be in Tirukkōṭṭiyūr, he was asked by Anantāḻvāṉ whether the Lord is seen in His Celestium (Heaven-Parama pada) with two arms or four arms. Bhaṭṭārya replied that the ‘Ekāyanas’ (Madhvās) hold that the Lord has only two arms while others say four. In the temple at Śrīraṅgam, the stationary image of Lord Raṅganātha, reclining on the Serpent-bed, in the Sanctum Sanctorum (Known as Periya Perumāḷ) is seen by us, with the naked eye, as having only two arms while those, with spiritual vision, see four arms and even more. Tirupppāṇāḻvār has seen Lord Raṅganātha with four arms, as set forth in his hymns (Amalaṉātipirāṉ-7). Maṇḍodari, wife of Rāvaṇa, saw the ultra-mundane form in Śrī Rāma, standing beside her fallen husband and described the former as the one beyond matter, the Sustainer, wielding the Conch, Discus and Mace. Śrī Rāma was generally seen only with two arms; Hanumān, however, alluded to many aims (*bhāhavaḥ*, Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa IV-3-14). Kṛṣṇa was seen by Vasudeva and Devakī, with four arms, right at birth, and He concealed the two extra arms, as desired by His revered father. And then, on the battlefield at Kurukṣetra, Arjuna prayed that he be allowed to see Kṛṣṇa back again with four arms instead of the thousands of arms he saw in His universal Form (Viśvarūpa) a little while ago (Bhagavad Gīṭā XI-46). In Rāmāyaṇa, Uttara Kāṇḍa 8-26, Sage Agastya addressed Śrī Rāma, as. “Thou art Nārāyaṇa, the ancient, the four-armed”. Nevertheless, one need not make a fetish of this, as four-handedness need not necessarily be a special sign of Divinity to wrest allegiance from mankind. (It is learnt that a four-handed human form is kept embalmed in Fyzabad museum near Ayodhyā. Would it become worthy of worship? No, not at all.)

\(v\) *Prostrate with joined legs and palms:*

‘*Joined legs*’ indicate immobility, ‘*ananyagatitva*’, or non-dependence on others—‘nowhere else to go’, in plain language.

‘*Joined palms*’ devote ‘*Ākiñcanya*’ or absence of any merit in the supplicant, attracting the Lord’s grace; in other words, it is only the Lord’s ‘*nirhetuka kṛpā*’, spontaneous or gratuitous grace that can deliver the goods.
