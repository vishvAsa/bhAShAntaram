**Tamil text and transliteration:**

துயக்கு அறு மதியில் நல் ஞானத்துள் அமரரைத் துயக்கும்  
மயக்கு உடை மாயைகள் வானிலும் பெரியன வல்லன்  
புயல் கரு நிறத்தனன்; பெரு நிலங் கடந்த நல் அடிப் போது  
அயர்ப்பிலன் அலற்றுவன் தழுவுவன் வணங்குவன் அமர்ந்தே.

tuyakku aṟu matiyil nal ñāṉattuḷ amararait tuyakkum  
mayakku uṭai māyaikaḷ vāṉilum periyaṉa vallaṉ  
puyal karu niṟattaṉaṉ; peru nilaṅ kaṭanta nal aṭip pōtu  
ayarppilaṉ alaṟṟuvaṉ taḻuvuvaṉ vaṇaṅkuvaṉ amarntē.

**English translation of verse 1.3.10:**

If aberrations are noticeable (now and then) in the mental attitudes of even those Amarars (*Celestials*) noted for clarity of knowledge and understanding) (like *Indra* and the ‘Nitya Sūrīs’, the ever free angels like *Garuḍa*), towards the supreme Lord, that is because the wonders (of His incarnation) exceed the bounds of the expansive sky and thus (easily) baffle them all. (Be that, as it may) I (on my part) shall unremittingly bow before the lovely feet of the cloud-hued Lord, which spanned the entire universe, embrace and extol them, with a mind wholly detached from all else.

**Notes**

\(i\) Speaking about the mental aberrations of even those exalted personages, here are two typical anecdotes: There was a time when the Devas were uprooted from their homes and their women folks were kidnapped by the Asuras. During His Avatāra, as Lord Kṛṣṇa, the Lord fought out the demons and restored the home and hearth to the Devas. While returning from that expedition, Śrī Kṛṣṇa took with Him a flower plant, plucked out from Indra’s garden, to be planted in His palace down below. The ungrateful Indra would, however, not tolerate it and, armed with his mace, he went in hot pursuit of the Lord to snatch the plant from Him.

\(ii\) And then, during the same Kṛṣṇāvatāra, Garuḍā came down to Earth in pursuit of a snake which, however, sought asylum in Lord Kṛṣṇa. Naturally, the Lord refused to release the snake when demanded by *Garuḍa*, and the latter made no secret of his resentment and uttered such harsh words as: “Is this the reward for my having carried you and your consorts on my shoulders all these years?”
