**[Tamil](/definition/tamil#history "show Tamil definitions") text and transliteration:**

திருமாலிருஞ்சோலை யானேயாகி செழு மூவுலகும் தன்-  
ஒருமா வயிற்றின்உள்ளே வைத்து ஊழி ஊழி தலையளிக்கும்  
திருமால்என்னை ஆளும்மால் சிவனும் பிரமனும்காணாது  
அருமால் எய்தி அடிபரவ அருளை ஈந்த அம்மானே.

tirumāliruñcōlai yāṉēyāki ceḻu mūvulakum taṉ-  
orumā vayiṟṟiṉuḷḷē vaittu ūḻi ūḻi talaiyaḷikkum  
tirumāleṉṉai āḷummāl civaṉum piramaṉumkāṇātu  
arumāl eyti aṭiparava aruḷai īnta ammāṉē.

**English translation of verse 10.7.6:**

The Supreme Lord Whom even Civaṉ and Piramaṉ couldn’t attain,  
Did on them shed His grace, when they intensely adored  
His lovely feet; He did in his stomach unique sustain  
The three worlds bright, at the end of each epoch and delivered;  
That Tirumāl stands now in Tirumāliruñcōlai and is very keen  
To enlist me as His vassal, shedding on me His love supreme.

**Notes:**

\(i\) The Lord, who sustained inside His little stomach all the worlds during the [deluge](/definition/deluge#history "show deluge definitions"), now wants to sustain Himself by clinging to the [Āḻvār](/definition/aḻvar#vaishnavism "show Āḻvār definitions") of whom He is passionately enamoured.

\(ii\) The Lord, who is well beyond the reach of even the exalted [Śiva](/definition/shiva#vaishnavism "show Śiva definitions") and [Brahmā](/definition/brahma#vaishnavism "show Brahmā definitions"), is now after the Āḻvār and it is only to get at him that He has come down to Tirumāliruñcōlai.
