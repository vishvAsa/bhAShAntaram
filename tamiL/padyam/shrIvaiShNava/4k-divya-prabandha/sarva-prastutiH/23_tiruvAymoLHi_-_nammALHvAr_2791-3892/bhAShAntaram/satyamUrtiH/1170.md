**[Tamil](/definition/tamil#history "show Tamil definitions") text and transliteration:**

தொண்டர் நும்தம் துயர்போகநீர் கமாய்  
விண்டுவாடாமலர்இட்டு நீர்இறைஞ்சுமின்  
வண்டுபாடும் பொழில்சூழ் திருக்கண்ணபுரத்து  
அண்டவாணன் அமரர்பெருமானையே

toṇṭar numtam tuyarpōkanīr kamāy  
viṇṭuvāṭāmalariṭṭu nīriṟaiñcumiṉ  
vaṇṭupāṭum poḻilcūḻ tirukkaṇṇapurattu  
aṇṭavāṇaṉ amararperumāṉaiyē

**English translation of verse 9.10.3:**

Ye, devout men, worship with devotion supreme  
And offer flowers in fresh bloom  
Unto the Sovereign Master of the Universe, Who dwells  
In Tirukkaṇṇapuram amid orchards where humming bees revel  
And thus all your ills and evils dispel.

**Notes:**

\(i\) The highest love to God is love rendered with no personal end in view but culminating in benediction or glorification of God. Love, so disinterestedly rendered, is love of [purity](/definition/purity#history "show purity definitions") and virginity, which carries with it the highest reward, namely, possession of God Himself. It is this kind of loving worship that the [Āḻvār](/definition/aḻvar#vaishnavism "show Āḻvār definitions") is preaching to the world around, now addressed by him with his characteristic solicitude and tenderness of heart.

\(ii\) The bees allude to the knowledgeable savants, with a keen sense of discrimination, capable of picking up the essentials (honey) and discarding the otherwise.

\(iii\) The Sovereign Master of the Universe, the overlord of the Celestials has condescended to come down to our midst, taking up abode in Tirukkaṇṇapuram where His dispensation operates both ways. The Lord not only dispels our age-long sins but also confers on us heavenly bliss, right here, in His immediate presence. Unlike the infirmary for the blind, where the sighted do not have to go for treatment, even the Celestials, well beyond the mischief of dark necescience, have to come to this dark land, to taste the Lord’s amazing simplicity (Saulabhya) which is far more pronounced here than in [heaven](/definition/heaven#history "show heaven definitions").
