மெய்யன்ஆகும் விரும்பித் தொழுவார்க்குஎல்லாம்  
பொய்யன்ஆகும் புறமே தொழுவார்க்குஎல்லாம்  
செய்யில்வாளைஉகளும் திருக்கண்ணபுரத்து  
ஐயன் ஆகத்துஅணைப்பார்கட்கு அணியனே.

meyyaṉākum virumpit toḻuvārkkuellām  
poyyaṉākum puṟamē toḻuvārkkuellām  
ceyyilvāḷaiukaḷum tirukkaṇṇapurattu  
aiyaṉ ākattuaṇaippārkaṭku aṇiyaṉē.

**English translation of verse 9.10.7:**

All His glory and splendour He does reveal  
Unto those that seek Him as the Be-all and End-all;  
On the other hand, His true [nature](/definition/nature#history "show nature definitions") He does conceal  
From them that worship Him for achieving their personal needs;  
Our Sire at Tirukkaṇṇapuram, in whose fertile [fields](/definition/field#history "show fields definitions")  
The fishes play about, is very close indeed  
To those that keep Him in their hearts imbedded.

**Notes:**

The Lord stays in His worshippable from at Tirukkaṇṇapuram, revealing Himself fully, unto those that love Him disinterestedly, as an end in itself, and concealing His true nature from those who seek petty, personal favours from Him and formally propitiate Him to secure their personal ends, devoid of true love unto Him.
