**Tamil text and transliteration:**

வல்லி சேர் நுண் இடை ஆய்ச்சியர் தம்மொடும்,  
கொல்லைமை செய்து குரவை பிணைந்தவர்,  
நல் அடிமேல் அணி நாறு துழாய் என்றே  
சொல்லுமால், சூழ் வினையாட்டியேன் பாவையே.

valli cēr nuṇ iṭai āycciyar tammoṭum,  
kollaimai ceytu kuravai piṇaintavar,  
nal aṭimēl aṇi nāṟu tuḻāy eṉṟē  
collumāl, cūḻ viṉaiyāṭṭiyēṉ pāvaiyē.

**English translation of verse 4.2.2:**

Ha! the statuesque daughter of this sinner dire  
Always pines for the tuḷaci fragrant, worn on the lovely feet  
Of the Lord who (as Kṛṣṇa) did around Him gather  
The thin-waisted shepherdesses and on them unleash  
Many a wily prank and with them merrily danced.

**Note**

It was a glorious night, the night of nights, when the classical dance, known as ‘Rāsa Krīḍā’, in Sanskrit and ‘Kuravai’, in Tamil, took place in Vrindāvan. Śrī Kṛṣṇa, assuming several forms, enchanting beyond description, danced in between one Gopi and another, His hands being locked up with theirs. Parāṅkuśa Nāyakī now pines for the fragrant tuḷaci worn by the Lord on His feet at that time, being a legitimate aspirant, comparable to the Gopis in question. Perhaps, the gnostic mother had pointed out to the Nāyakī that her pining for the tuḷaci garland worn by the Lord during the great deluge as a measure of universal protection, in a remote past, was not merely out of date but also out of place.
