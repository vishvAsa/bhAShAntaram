**Tamil text and transliteration:**

தீர்ப்பாரை யாம் இனி எங்ஙனம் நாடுதும் அன்னைமீர்,  
ஓர்ப்பால் இவ் ஒள் நுதல் உற்ற நல் நோய் இது தேறினோம்,  
போர்ப்பாகு தான் செய்து அன்று ஐவரை வெல்வித்த, மாயப்போர்த்  
தேர்ப்பாகனார்க்கு இவள் சிந்தை துழாய்த் திசைக்கின்றதே?

tīrppārai yām iṉi eṅṅaṉam nāṭutum aṉṉaimīr,  
ōrppāl iv oḷ nutal uṟṟa nal nōy itu tēṟiṉōm,  
pōrppāku tāṉ ceytu aṉṟu aivarai velvitta, māyappōrt  
tērppākaṉārkku ivaḷ cintai tuḻāyt ticaikkiṉṟatē?

**English translation of verse 4.6.1:**

Ye, Elders, where shall we seek hence, the one that can cure  
The malady of this young one, with forehead bright?  
A delightful sickness of Spirit ‘tis, I am sure,  
She her mind has lost in Him that drove the chariot  
In the wondrous battle and victory for the (Pāṇḍavas) five did secure.

**Note**

Face is the index of the mind. The agony of those killed by arrows or drowned in water is writ large on their faces. The unique sickness of spiritual character, the Nāyakī is suffering from, is reflected on her forehead The glow on her forehead helps to diagnose her malady as one that can be cured only by the Lord who inducted it, by stealing away her heart. Far from finding a cure for this, it is but meet that every one should aspire to acquire this kind of sickness and develop it. The Nāyakī felt entranced by the Lord’s overwhelming love for His devotees, doing all odd jobs, such as driving their chariots, running errands on their behalf and so on. The present malady is the result of such an infatuation. Actually, this reflects the mood of all the Āḻvārs, steeped in God-love, in sharp contrast with Rṣis, noted for clarity of mind, unperturbed by the sentimental God-love, God-hunger and things of that sort.
