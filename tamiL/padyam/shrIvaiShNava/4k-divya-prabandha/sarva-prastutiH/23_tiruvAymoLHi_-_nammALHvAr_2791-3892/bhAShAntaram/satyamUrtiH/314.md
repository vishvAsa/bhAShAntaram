**[Tamil](/definition/tamil#history "show Tamil definitions") text and transliteration:**

சாதி மாணிக்கம் என்கோ! சவி கொள் பொன் முத்தம் என்கோ  
சாதி நல் வயிரம் என்கோ, தவிவு இல் சீர் விளக்கம் என்கோ,  
ஆதி அம் சோதி என்கோ! ஆதி அம் புருடன் என்கோ,  
ஆதும் இல் காலத்து எந்தை அச்சுதன் அமலனையே!

cāti māṇikkam eṉkō! cavi koḷ poṉ muttam eṉkō  
cāti nal vayiram eṉkō, tavivu il cīr viḷakkam eṉkō,  
āti am cōti eṉkō! āti am puruṭaṉ eṉkō,  
ātum il kālattu entai accutaṉ amalaṉaiyē!

**English translation of verse 3.4.4:**

Shall I say that ‘Accutan’ is my immaculate Lord  
Who fathered me, when forlorn and (ever afterwards)  
Held on to me, is the pure gem or the shining [gold](/definition/gold#history "show gold definitions")  
Or the [ruby](/definition/ruby#history "show ruby definitions") flashy or choice diamond or the eternal [lamp](/definition/lamp#history "show lamp definitions")  
Or the One of resplendent form or the blissful Primate?

**Notes**

\(i\) Asked by a worldling for tips as to how to remember the Supreme Lord, a knowledgeable elder queried back, “Pray, tell me how to forget God”. The Lord is everywhere, stays in all things having name and form and hence the wise men always perceive the Lord’s intimate contact and presence in each and everything. That is why the Lord has said in His ‘Song Celestial’ (10-41) whatever is of superlative eminence contains a special element of His all-conquering power. The [Āḻvār](/definition/aḻvar#vaishnavism "show Āḻvār definitions"), therefore, says that, with a natural, built-in Grace, bliss and beauty, God is the very best of all good things.

\(ii\) The eternal lamp that God is, He is anterior to all other luminous bodies, like Sun and Moon.

\(iii\) *[Acyuta](/definition/acyuta#vaishnavism "show Acyuta definitions"), the eternal Father*: While in a forlorn state, with no attainment whatever, on his part, to attract the Lord’s grace, the Lord, on His own, revealed to the Āḻvār the indissoluble bond subsisting between them, the inviolable ‘Father-Son’ relationship and held on to him firmly thereafter.
