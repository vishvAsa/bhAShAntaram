**Tamil text and transliteration:**

பெருமையனே வானத்து இமையோர்க்கும் காண்டற்கு-  
அருமையனே ஆகத்தணை யாதார்க்கு என்றும்-  
திருமெய் உறைகின்ற செங்கண்மால் நாளும்-  
இருமை வினைகடிந்து இங்கு என்னைஆள்கின்றானே.

perumaiyaṉē vāṉattu imaiyōrkkum kāṇṭaṟku-  
arumaiyaṉē ākattaṇai yātārkku eṉṟum-  
tirumey uṟaikiṉṟa ceṅkaṇmāl nāḷum-  
irumai viṉaikaṭintu iṅku eṉṉaiāḷkiṉṟāṉē.

**English translation of verse 10.4.2:**

Of grandeur great that does surpass the Celestials  
In the upper worlds, the Lord is hardly visible  
To those that do not in His heart lovingly inhere;  
The lotus-eyed Lord, Who holds Tiru, for ever,  
On His person, has the fruits wiped out, right here,  
Of my acts, good and bad, and on top of that  
Enlisted me in His service, day in and day out.

**Notes:**

\(i\) The felicity, conferred by the Lord’s lovely feet on those pursuing the path of loving devotion, was pointed out, in general, in the preceding song. From this song and onwards, the Āḻvār sets out the benefits accrued to him, personally. The Lord has bestowed on the Āḻvār, right here, the felicity of divine service, that is usually attainable in Heaven alone.

\(ii\) “*Inaccessible to those who do not inhere in His heart*”

The Lord is inaccessible to those who do not bear any love for Him and are, therefore, not eager to envision Him and commune with Him. As a matter of fact, it is only to those on whom His spontaneous grace alights (Paragata svīkāra), that He becomes accessible.
