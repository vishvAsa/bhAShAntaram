**Tamil text and transliteration:**

விரும்பிப் பகவரைக் காணில் 'வியல் இடம் உண்டானே!' என்னும்,  
கரும் பெரு மேகங்கள் காணில் 'கண்ணன்' என்று ஏறப் பறக்கும்,  
பெரும் புல ஆ நிரை காணில் 'பிரான் உளன்' என்று பின் செல்லும்,  
அரும் பெறல் பெண்ணினை மாயோன் அலற்றி அயர்ப்பிக்கின்றானே!

virumpip pakavaraik kāṇil 'viyal iṭam uṇṭāṉē!' eṉṉum,  
karum peru mēkaṅkaḷ kāṇil 'kaṇṇaṉ' eṉṟu ēṟap paṟakkum,  
perum pula ā nirai kāṇil 'pirāṉ uḷaṉ' eṉṟu piṉ cellum,  
arum peṟal peṇṇiṉai māyōṉ alaṟṟi ayarppikkiṉṟāṉē!

**English translation of verse 4.4.9:**

This daughter of mine, difficult to attain, is made to cry out,  
Mad with love for her wondrous Lord; if ascetics she met.  
She would with devotion exclaim, “Oh, Saviour great,  
Who did the sprawling worlds in your stomach sustain,”  
She would want to leap up to the dark-cloud, dense,  
Saying, “Tis Kaṇṇaṉ, my Lord”; after cows, hefty and nice,  
Run she would, hoping to meet her Lord, the Cow-herd divine.

**Notes**

\(i\) Indeed, Parāṅkuśa Nāyakī is a daughter, rare of attainment, who has enriched the world she lived in, with her lofty thoughts and noble conduct, surcharged with God-love of a unique order.

\(ii\) Seeing the water-laden cloud, the Nāyakī felt that Lord Kṛṣṇa presented Himself before her and she would want to reach Him, high up there. Here is an anecdote to illustrate how devotees felt entranced by the rain-clouds, seeing their likeness to the Lord’s complexion.

Tiruvāykulattāḻvār, a resident of Rājendra Cōḷaṉ,went to the fields during a rainy season to inspect the crops. As he approached the fields, he saw the clouds above, which instantly put into his mind the cloud-hued Lord Viṣṇu. In a fit of ecstasy, he fell down unconscious. One of the cultivators, standing nearby, gathered him up and escorted him to his house. The escort, however, blamed the inmates of the house for having allowed one of such saintly temperament to go out for fieldinspection during the rainy season.
