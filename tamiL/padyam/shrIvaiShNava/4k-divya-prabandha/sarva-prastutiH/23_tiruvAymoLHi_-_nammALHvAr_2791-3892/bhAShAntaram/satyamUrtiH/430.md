**Tamil text and transliteration:**

பூசும் சாந்து என் நெஞ்சமே புனையும் கண்ணி எனதுடைய,  
வாசகம் செய் மாலையே வான் பட்டு ஆடையும் அஃதே,  
தேசம் ஆன அணிகலனும் என் கைகூப்புச் செய்கையே,  
ஈசன் ஞாலம் உண்டு உமிழ்ந்த எந்தை ஏக மூர்த்திக்கே.

pūcum cāntu eṉ neñcamē puṉaiyum kaṇṇi eṉatuṭaiya,  
vācakam cey mālaiyē vāṉ paṭṭu āṭaiyum aḵtē,  
tēcam āṉa aṇikalaṉum eṉ kaikūppuc ceykaiyē,  
īcaṉ ñālam uṇṭu umiḻnta entai ēka mūrttikkē.

**English translation of verse 4.3.2:**

My mind alone is the sandal paste eminently fit  
For the supreme Lord of form unique  
Who once did gulp the worlds and then spat them out;  
The hymns by my tongue knit do His garlands make  
And His silken robes as well; my salutation with joined palms  
Decorates Him with many a jewel that gleams.

**Note**

The Āḻvār keeps meditating on the Lord’s resplendent Form and His extraordinary love for him. All the three faculties of the Āḻvār-word, deed and thought-are extremely delectable to Him and loom large in His eyes. If the Āḻvār’s mind is unto Him as aromatic as the sandal paste, his hymns are like unto the colourful garlands made of choice flowers of special fragrance. These very hymns of the Āḻvār also serve as the silken robes donned by the Lord with great pleasure. It is said that the apparel oft proclaims the man, and here, the Āḻvār’s hymns, proclaiming the Lord’s glory, serve as His apparel. And then, a single salutation made by the Āḻvār to the Lord by joining his palms, makes Him feel as though He has been fully decorated with jewels of extra-radiance. The Āḻvār is simply amazed at the astounding love of the Lord for him, as above.
