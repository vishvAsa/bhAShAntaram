**[Tamil](/definition/tamil#history "show Tamil definitions") text and transliteration:**

நோற்ற நோன்பு இலேன் நுண் அறிவு இலேன் ஆகிலும் இனி உன்னை விட்டு  
ஒன்றும் ஆற்ற கிற்கின்றிலேன் அரவின் அணை அம்மானே  
சேற்றுத் தாமரை செந்நெல் ஊடு மலர் சிரீவரமங்கல நகர்  
வீற்றிருந்த எந்தாய்! உனக்கு மிகை அல்லேன் அங்கே.

nōṟṟa nōṉpu ilēṉ nuṇ aṟivu ilēṉ ākilum iṉi uṉṉai viṭṭu  
oṉṟum āṟṟa kiṟkiṉṟilēṉ araviṉ aṇai ammāṉē  
cēṟṟut tāmarai cennel ūṭu malar cirīvaramaṅkala [nakar](/definition/nakar#history "show nakar definitions")  
vīṟṟirunta entāy! uṉakku mikai allēṉ aṅkē.

**English translation of verse 5.7.1:**

Oh, Lord on [serpent](/definition/serpent#history "show serpent definitions")-bed, in Cirīvaramaṅkalam you graciously reside.  
Abounding in [paddy](/definition/paddy#history "show paddy definitions") [fields](/definition/field#history "show fields definitions") [rich](/definition/rich#history "show rich definitions") where blooms lotus fine;  
Rituals I haven’t performed any, while of knowledge acute I am devoid  
And yet, even for a while, apart from you I can’t remain;  
Surely, you can’t keep me outside the scope of your protection.

#### Notes

\(i\) There was a time when the [Āḻvār](/definition/aḻvar#vaishnavism "show Āḻvār definitions") knew neither his essential [nature](/definition/nature#history "show nature definitions") (Svasvarūpa) nor that of the Supreme Lord. It was but natural that he should have foregone Him while in that state; how could he be made to forego Him even now when he is quite alive to His greatness and his own lowliness? But then, he hasn’t [pursued](/definition/pursued#history "show pursued definitions") any of the well-known paths of discipline, [karma yoga](/definition/karmayoga#vaishnavism "show karma yoga definitions") or [Jñāna yoga](/definition/jnanayoga#vaishnavism "show Jñāna yoga definitions") or [Bhakti yoga](/definition/bhaktiyoga#vaishnavism "show Bhakti yoga definitions"). The Āḻvār is, therefore, in the predicament of a hungry person without [food](/definition/food#history "show food definitions"), the means of appeasing his hunger. He wants the Lord, as the liberal Benefactor, to feed him looking to his enormous appetite (God-hunger) and he can’t think of any other means but the Lord Himself.

\(ii\) Reference to the Lord's serpent—bed (Ādi Śeṣa) in the opening [line](/definition/line#history "show line definitions"), is suggestive of the Āḻvār’s inordinate longing to serve the Lord, in ever so many ways, like the Ādiśeṣa. Here then is the suggestion to the Lord to enlist the Āḻvār in His service, like Ādiśeṣa.
