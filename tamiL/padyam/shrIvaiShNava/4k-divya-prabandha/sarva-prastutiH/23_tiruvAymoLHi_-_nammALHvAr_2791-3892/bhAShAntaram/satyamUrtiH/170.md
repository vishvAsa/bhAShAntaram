**Tamil text and transliteration:**

முன் நல் யாழ் பயில் நூல் நரம்பின் முதிர் சுவையே,  
பல் நலார் பயிலும் பரனே பவித்திரனே,  
கன்னலே அமுதே கார் முகிலே என் கண்ணா,  
நின் அலால் இலேன்காண் என்னை நீ குறிக்கொள்ளே.

muṉ nal yāḻ payil nūl narampiṉ mutir cuvaiyē,  
pal nalār payilum paraṉē pavittiraṉē,  
kaṉṉalē amutē kār mukilē eṉ kaṇṇā,  
niṉ alāl ilēṉkāṇ eṉṉai nī kuṟikkoḷḷē.

**English translation of verse 2.3.7:**

You are the delectable melody, chaste and matured, From the ancient lyre, and by the eminent adored;  
Oh, Lord! pure and Supreme, sweet like nectar and cane juice  
My cloud-hued Kaṇṇā! I do seek refuge  
In none but you, take note and make me yours.

**Notes**

\(i\) Notwithstanding the assertion, as in the last song, that he belonged to the Lord from time immemorial, the Āḻvār apprehends the frightful possibility of getting separated from the Lord, over again, and he, therefore, entreats Him to note that he cannot brook separation from Him Who is sweetness itself. The sweetness of music which attracts the cow, the infant and the snake alike, is proverbial, and the Lord is the very source of this sweetness.

\(ii\) That the Lord is pure needs no special mention but what is emphasised here is that He purifies worldlings like us and makes us fit to join the rank and file of the pure souls in the yonder Heavens.
