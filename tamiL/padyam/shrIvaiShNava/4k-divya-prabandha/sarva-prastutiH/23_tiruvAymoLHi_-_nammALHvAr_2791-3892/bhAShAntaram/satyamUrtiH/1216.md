**English translation of verse 10.3.8:**

With [fear](/definition/fear#history "show fear definitions") does my dear [life](/definition/life#history "show life definitions") quiver what unto you might befall,  
When You are away, tending the cattle; You’ll do well  
Not to go behind the cows, Oh, [Kaṇṇā](/definition/kanna#history "show Kaṇṇā definitions"), better stay here,  
Leave me not, lest my boundless love for You shall [thro](/definition/thro#history "show thro definitions")’ every pore  
Pierce poor me; I’d rather not mind Your flirting right here  
With those other thin-waisted damsels You love whom You [rope](/definition/rope#history "show rope definitions")  
Thro’ Your lotus eyes, hands and feet and Your silken robe.

**Notes:**

Then [Kṛṣṇa](/definition/krishna#vaishnavism "show Kṛṣṇa definitions") retorted that it was not merely a matter of His tending the cows but also His fulfilling His engagements with those other ladies, as the [Gopīs](/definition/gopi#vaishnavism "show Gopīs definitions") had themselves hinted at. Here then is the interesting, rather impressive reply of the [Gopī](/definition/gopi#vaishnavism "show Gopī definitions"). She says: “All that I want is that You should be right in our presence. As a compromise, I would not even mind Your flirting with those other ladies of your heart, right here. You don’t have to go or send some one to fetch them. Your entrancing looks and Your sweet voice shall bring them unto you, your loving hands shall gather the bashful ones up and your silken robe shall obstruct those, bent down in the exhilaration of your touch and pull them upwards. Well, these constitute the messengers in question. It will suffice if you just put aside your upper garment and expose Your exquisite charm”.
