**Tamil text and transliteration:**

காண்கொடுப்பான்அல்லன் ஆர்க்கும் தன்னை கைசெய்அப்பாலதுஓர் மாயம்தன்னால்  
மாண்குறள் கோலவடிவுகாட்டி மண்ணும் விண்ணும் நிறைய மலர்ந்த  
சேண்சுடர்த்தோள்கள் பலதழைத்த தேவபிராற்கு என் நிறைவினோடு  
நாண்கொடுத்தேன் இனி என்கொடுக்கேன் என்னுடை நல்நுதல் நங்கைமீர்காள்

**English translation of verse 8.2.9:**

My mates with foreheads bright, I have to lose nothing more,  
Having my feminity lost and with that, my sense of modesty  
Unto the Lord of the Celestials, with shoulders many, bright and hefty,  
Who the most exalted eludes and remains unseen but aid appear before (Bali), as the unique Vāmana, charming beyond compare,  
And did from him snatch, on the sly, all the worlds,  
Earth, Svarga and all, which He did span and pervade.

**Notes:**

\(i\) The Nāyakī averred in the preceding song that the Lord would certainly grant admission to His transcendent abode, if we unreservedly gave up attachment to all things ungodly. She was hit back by the mates, who said that ail that the Nāyakī could do was to sever her connections with them and go on losing all her possessions, one by one, but she would never gain the Lord, she longed for, at such great cost. And now, the Nāyakī says that she has nothing more to lose, having already lost her feminine bearing itself, along with modesty, its essential ingredient. She has thus lost both her priceless kingdoms, whereas the Lord restored to Indra, his lost kingdom, getting it back from Mahābali. The Nāyakī and Bali sail in the same boat, both having lost their respective kingdoms, enthralled by the Lord’s exquisite charm. Even so, Bali won everlasting fame as a great donor.

\(ii\) The Lord would not reveal Himself to those, who seek to gain His presence, by dint of their own efforts, however exalted they might be. So far as the Nāyakī is concerned, she has been enthralled by His bewitching beauty, which He revealed unto her and, in the process, He has stolen away her heart and all, even as He appeared before Mahābali, as the exquisite Vāmana and snatched away all his possessions. The shoulders and the entire frame of the Lord’s person went on expanding the moment Bali poured water into His right palm, betokening his gift unto the Lord of what was sought of him.
