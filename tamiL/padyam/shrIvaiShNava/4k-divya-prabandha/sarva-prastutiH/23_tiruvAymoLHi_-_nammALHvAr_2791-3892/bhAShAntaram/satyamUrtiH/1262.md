**Tamil text and transliteration:**

தானே ஆகி நிறைந்து எல்லாஉலகும் உயிரும் தானேஆய்  
தானே யான்என்பான்ஆகி தன்னைத் தானே துதித்து எனக்குத்-  
தேனே பாலே கன்னலே அமுதே திருமாலிருஞ்சோலைக்  
கோனே ஆகி நின்றொழிந்தான் என்னை முற்றும் உயிர்உண்டே.

tāṉē āki niṟaintu ellāulakum uyirum tāṉēāy  
tāṉē yāṉeṉpāṉāki taṉṉait tāṉē tutittu eṉakkut-  
tēṉē pālē kaṉṉalē amutē tirumāliruñcōlaik  
kōṉē āki niṉṟoḻintāṉ eṉṉai muṟṟum uyiruṇṭē.

**English translation of verse 10.7.2:**

Me the Lord did, in full, consume  
And now full has He become;  
The inner soul of worlds and beings, one and all  
Stands now transformed into me, I do fed,  
He lauds Himself thro’ me and sweet unto me  
Like candy and nectar, milk and honey,  
Lord of Tirumāliruñcōlai He has now become.

**Notes:**

\(i\) The Āḻvār finds that the Lord, Who mingled with him, completely displaced him and spread Himself out, in full, over the entire body of the Āḻvār; nay, He attained perfection and His sovereign stature only after this event. He could become God indeed only after the songs of His glory flowed from the sweet lips of the Āḻvār. It can be recalled that it is the Āḻvār who asserted the Supremacy of the Lord, vide II-2 and IV-10 of this hymnal.

\(ii\) The present predicament, in which the Āḻvār, basically the Lord’s vassal, is being subserved by Him, has been aptly described by the great Nampiḻlai in his unique diction, as follows: Dislodged from his normal stance, the Āḻvār gropes in vain to get at himself; all that he could discover, in the process is that he is being carried aloft over the Lord’s head.

\(iii\) The Lord is not merely the object of laudation but the very author of laudation, singing, as He does His own glory through the medium of the Āḻvār. If, in the endsong of each decad, it is said that it is Caṭakōpaṉ’s (Āḻvār’s) utterance, well, it is the Lord, Who made him say so.

\(iv\) The Lord is exceedingly delicious to the Āḻvār, but instead of his drinking deep of that insatiable nectar, the Lord forestalled him and drank him up, leaving no trace of him behind.
