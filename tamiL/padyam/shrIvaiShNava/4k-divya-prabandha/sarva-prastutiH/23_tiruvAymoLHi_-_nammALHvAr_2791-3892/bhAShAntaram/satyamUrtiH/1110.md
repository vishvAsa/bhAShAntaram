**Tamil text and transliteration:**

உயிர்க்குஅது காலன்என்று உம்மை யான்இரந்தேற்குநீர்  
குயில் பைதல்காள் கண்ணன் நாமமே குழறிக்கொன்றீர்  
தயிர்ப்பழஞ்சோற்றொடு பால்அடிசிலும் தந்து சொல்  
பயிற்றிய நல்வளம்ஊட்டினீர் பண்புஉடையீரே!

uyirkkuatu kālaṉeṉṟu ummai yāṉirantēṟkunīr  
kuyil paitalkāḷ kaṇṇaṉ nāmamē kuḻaṟikkoṉṟīr  
tayirppaḻañcōṟṟoṭu pālaṭicilum tantu col  
payiṟṟiya nalvaḷamūṭṭiṉīr paṇpuuṭaiyīrē!

**English translation of verse 9.5.8:**

Ye, young Koel-birds, I did entreat you not to utter  
The name of Kaṇṇaṉ and put me in a flutter,  
And yet, His name You spell and me You do slaughter;  
Well, this is how you return my kindness, you I did feed  
With curd and rice, cold and cooked with milk, I did also teach  
How to utter the Lord’s name; how nice of you indeed!

**Notes:**

In her present state of desolation, the Nāyakī is in no mood to listen to the Lord’s name being chanted by any one and much less, her own pet birds, particularly, the name of Lord Kṛṣṇa. The Nāyakī reared up the birds with curd, rice and milk and taught them also how to utter the Lord’s names, Rāma, Kṛṣṇa and so on. A little while ago, the Nāyakī had asked these birds not to utter the name of kṛṣṇa, so dear to her and yet, very bitter in her present state. The name of Rāma, the elixir of life, the Redeemer of even the dead was, however, permitted by her, as it would help to sustain her and pull through. The birds, however, pronounced only Kṛṣṇa’s name, with a vengeance, the Nāyakī could hardly make out and it is this that she calls massacre, pure and simple. The Nāyakī naturally feels vexed that these birds, on whom she had lavished a lot of affection and attention, should now do her a bad turn.
