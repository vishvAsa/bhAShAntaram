**Tamil text and transliteration:**

நிறம் கரியானுக்கு நீடு உலகு உண்ட,  
திறம் கிளர் வாய்ச் சிறுக் கள்வன் அவற்கு,  
கறங்கிய சக்கரக் கையவனுக்கு, என்  
பிறங்கு இரும் கூந்தல் இழந்தது பீடே.

niṟam kariyāṉukku nīṭu ulaku uṇṭa,  
tiṟam kiḷar vāyc ciṟuk kaḷvaṉ avaṟku,  
kaṟaṅkiya cakkarak kaiyavaṉukku, eṉ  
piṟaṅku irum kūntal iḻantatu pīṭē.

**English translation of verse 6.6.3:**

With her thoughts centred on the dark-hued Lord,  
Who the discus dynamic does in His hand hold,  
Whose lips suggest His having gulped down all the worlds,  
Who, in His stomach small, hid many a big world.  
My daughter with dense locks lovely, has her majestic bearing lost.

**Note**

The Lord, as the great Saviour, sustained all the worlds, with their variegated contents, in His stomach, during the deluge. And yet, the Nāyakī distressingly feels that it is all mere story, inasmuch as He has failed to extend to her the protection she badly needs.
