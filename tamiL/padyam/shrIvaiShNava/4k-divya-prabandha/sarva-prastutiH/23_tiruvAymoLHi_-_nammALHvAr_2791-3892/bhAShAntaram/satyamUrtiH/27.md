**[Tamil](/definition/tamil#history "show Tamil definitions") text and transliteration:**

ஒடுங்க அவன்கண் ஒடுங்கலும் எல்லாம்  
விடும் பின்னும் ஆக்கை விடும்பொழுது எண்ணே.

oṭuṅka avaṉkaṇ oṭuṅkalum ellām  
viṭum piṉṉum ākkai viṭumpoḻutu eṇṇē.

**English translation of verse 1.2.9:**

Once you (realise your true relationship with God, He, as the Proprietor and you, as His property and) dedicate yourself to Him (with this awakening), all your sins (which kept you away from Him, so long) will cease; (once the cause ceases, the effect, namely, the body which tethers you will automatically cease) await then, the day when the physical body falls off.

**Note**

As soon as the body drops off, [salvation](/definition/salvation#history "show salvation definitions"), sure and certain, waits at the door of one who entrusts oneself to the Lord’s keeping, with the spiritual awakening, as above.
