**[Tamil](/definition/tamil#history "show Tamil definitions") text and transliteration:**

ஒத்தார் மிக்காரை இலையாய மாமாய,  
ஒத்தாய் எப் பொருட்கும் உயிர் ஆய், என்னைப் பெற்ற-  
அத் தாய் ஆய் தந்தை ஆய் அறியாதன அறிவித்து,  
அத்தா, நீ செய்தன அடியேன் அறியேனே.

ottār mikkārai ilaiyāya māmāya,  
ottāy ep poruṭkum uyir āy, eṉṉaip peṟṟa-  
at tāy āy tantai āy aṟiyātaṉa aṟivittu,  
attā, nī ceytaṉa aṭiyēṉ aṟiyēṉē.

**English translation of verse 2.3.2:**

There’s none above you, Oh, Lord of wondrous traits!  
And none equal to you, and yet forms you’d take  
Like all others; you are the [life](/definition/life#history "show life definitions")-giver  
To one and all, the Mother that yielded me, the Father  
And Preceptor, ‘tis beyond me to list out all your favours.

**Notes**

\(i\) While patting on the back of his forward mind, in the preceding song, the [Āḻvār](/definition/aḻvar#vaishnavism "show Āḻvār definitions") realised that even such an evolved mind was but the Lord’s gift and, therefore, he passed on to sing the glory of God.

\(ii\) When this song was discoursed upon, by that great preceptor, Empār, the question was raised by some one in the learned assembly as to who is the first spiritual preceptor for every Individual. Some said, “The [Guru](/definition/guru#vaishnavism "show Guru definitions") who imparts the requisite spiritual knowledge”, while some others observed “It is the Śrī [Vaiṣṇava](/definition/vaishnava#vaishnavism "show Vaiṣṇava definitions") who puts us on to the spiritual preceptor for acceptance”. Empār, however, clarified: “Indeed, the Lord, [seated](/definition/seat#history "show seated definitions") in the region of our heart, is the first Preceptor, hidden and unseen though, for it is He who, from His vantage position inside us, granted us the impulse not to resist but to yield to the good offices of the visible preceptors outside and of the helpers who put us on to such preceptors.
