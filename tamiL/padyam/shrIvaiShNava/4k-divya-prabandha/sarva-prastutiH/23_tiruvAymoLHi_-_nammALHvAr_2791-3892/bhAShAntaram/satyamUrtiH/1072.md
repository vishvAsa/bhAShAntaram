**English translation of verse 9.2.9:**

Oh, Lord, reposing in Tiruppuḷiṅkuṭi, amid paddy fields fertile,  
Where fishes young wade thro’ water in marshy soil,  
Oh, wielder of weapons which deal on the Asuras blows deadly!  
May You, in this land vast, remain seated stately,  
For us, your vassals, to sing your praise in benedictive hymns  
And for ever drink deep the exquisite charm  
Of your delicate form, like unto flower in fresh bloom.

**Notes:**

\(i\) The Lord, in His boundless grace, has deigned to come to this distasteful land, with all its dirt and devilry, and present His worshippable Form to the householders over here, despite their callous indifference. It is indeed an act of grace galore, on His part, to have condescended, out of sheer love, to make Himself visible to the worldly men, who love all but Him Who really matters. Well, it is in His Arcā (Worshippable) Form that the Lord hangs on, willy-nilly, to the frail mankind and tries to redeem them, at all costs, their indifference notwithstanding, vide also aphorism 38 of ‘Śrīvacana Bhūṣaṇam’.

\(ii\) The Āḻvār has no doubt enjoyed the reclining pose of the Lord at Tiruppuḷiṅkuṭi. And yet, he longs to see Him seated and enjoy the new posture of the Lord, his eyes drinking deep the nectarean Form of the Lord. Śrī Parāśara Bhaṭṭar would say that one can revel in Śrīraṅgam, beholding the Lord in a reclining as well as standing posture and Goddess Raṅganāyakī, in the sitting posture.
