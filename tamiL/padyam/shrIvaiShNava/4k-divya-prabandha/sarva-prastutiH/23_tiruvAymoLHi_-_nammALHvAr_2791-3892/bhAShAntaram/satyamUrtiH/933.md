**Tamil text and transliteration:**

காலம் இளைக்கில் அல்லால் வினையேன் நான் இளைக்கின்றிலன் கண்டு கொள்மின்  
ஞாலம் அறியப் பழிசுமந்தேன் நல்நுதலீர்! இனி நாணித்தான்என்  
நீலமலர் நெடும்சோதிசூழ்ந்த நீண்டமுகில்வண்ணன் கண்ணன் கொண்ட  
கோலவளையொடும் மாமைகொள்வான் எத்தனைகாலமும் கூடச்சென்றே?

kālam iḷaikkil allāl viṉaiyēṉ nāṉ iḷaikkiṉṟilaṉ kaṇṭu koḷmiṉ  
ñālam aṟiyap paḻicumantēṉ nalnutalīr! iṉi nāṇittāṉeṉ  
nīlamalar neṭumcōticūḻnta nīṇṭamukilvaṇṇaṉ kaṇṇaṉ koṇṭa  
kōlavaḷaiyoṭum māmaikoḷvāṉ ettaṉaikālamum kūṭacceṉṟē?

**English translation of verse 8.2.3:**

I am in endless pursuit of Kaṇṇaṉ, my cloud-hued Lord,  
Of limitless blue, beaming far and wide, to get unto me restored,  
My bangles lovely and complexion fair; Indeed, the whole world,  
Blames me for transgression of my bounds, Ye, mates with foreheads bright.  
There’s no use my fighting shy anymore, please note;  
This sinner will persevere and me Time can never beat.

**Notes:**

Apart from the crowning trait of modesty for women, as a class, the ‘Prapanna’, who pursues the path of loving surrender to the Lord’s voluntary grace, has to await the descent of such grace at the time deemed appropriate by the Lord, with absolute faith in Him, a robust confidence. It is this very plank, the mates also stand upon and so, they try to bring round the Nāyāki. But the Nāyakī says, she has become brazen, after all the notoriety and opprobrium she has earned by dint of her sending the birds and bees as emissaries (1-4) and her attempt to come into the open and arraign the Lord for His cruel unresponsiveness (5-3). She is determined to try till the end of time and get back her bangles, the external possession, and modesty, the internal decoration, stolen away from her by the Lord of exquisite charm. This is, as it were, a challenge to the mates who advised the Nāyakī to give up her futile pursuit, right now, instead of acknowledging defeat at a later date, after a long and strenuous struggle.
