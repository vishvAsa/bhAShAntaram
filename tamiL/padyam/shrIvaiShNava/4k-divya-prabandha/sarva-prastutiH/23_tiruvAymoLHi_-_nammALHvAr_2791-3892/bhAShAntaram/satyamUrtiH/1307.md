**Tamil text and transliteration:**

பெற்றுஇனிப் போக்குவனோ உன்னை என் தனிப்பேருயிரை  
உற்ற இருவினையாய் உயிராய்ப் பயன் ஆவையாய்  
முற்றஇம் மூவுலகும் பெரும்தூறுஆய் தூற்றில்புக்கு  
முற்றக் கரந்துஒளித்தாய்! என்முதல் தனிவித்தேயோ!

peṟṟuiṉip pōkkuvaṉō uṉṉai eṉ taṉippēruyirai  
uṟṟa iruviṉaiyāy uyirāyp payaṉ āvaiyāy  
muṟṟaim mūvulakum perumtūṟuāy tūṟṟilpukku  
muṟṟak karantuoḷittāy! eṉmutal taṉivittēyō!

**English translation of verse 10.10.8:**

You are the Architect of acts good and bad, the souls indulge,  
You are also the Inner Controller of the souls steeped in bondage;  
Pleasure and pain, for acts good and bad, You deal out,  
The Three worlds, the dense bush of Samsāṛa, You did create,  
None can see You but yet the bush dense You permeate;  
The Redeemer great, You did in me kindle love for You,  
My Prop unique You are, how indeed can I leave You?

**Notes:**

\(i\) “How can the body outlive the soul, supporting it from within?” queries the Āḻvār. If, at the moment, the Āḻvār is soaked in God-love and he looks upon God as his Sole Sustainer, it is due entirely to the special efforts made by the Lord since long, directed towards the Āḻvār’s redemption. When the Āḻvār declares that he cannot let go the Lord, after having been united to Him so intimately, he means to say that he shall not subsist without Him and his very survival is, therefore, contingent upon his union with Him.

\(ii\) The main purpose of this song would appear to be to bring home to the Lord that He is all in all, the Great Redeemer and Sole Sustainer of all beings and that He should not, therefore, look for any merit, as such, in the Āḻvār, to compel His attention and warrant the influx of His grace.
