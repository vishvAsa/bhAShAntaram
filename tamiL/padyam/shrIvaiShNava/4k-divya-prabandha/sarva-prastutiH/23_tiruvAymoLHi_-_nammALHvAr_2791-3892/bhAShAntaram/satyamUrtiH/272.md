**Tamil text and transliteration:**

முடிச்சோதியாய் உனது முகச் சோதி மலர்ந்ததுவோ,  
அடிச்சோதி நீநின்ற தாமரையாய் அலர்ந்ததுவோ,  
படிச்சோதி ஆடையொடும் பல் கலனாய், நின்பைம்பொன்  
கடிச்சோதி கலந்ததுவோ? திருமாலே! கட்டுரையே. (2)

muṭiccōtiyāy uṉatu mukac cōti malarntatuvō,  
aṭiccōti nīniṉṟa tāmaraiyāy alarntatuvō,  
paṭiccōti āṭaiyoṭum pal kalaṉāy, niṉpaimpoṉ  
kaṭiccōti kalantatuvō? tirumālē! kaṭṭuraiyē. (2)

**English translation of verse 3.1.1:**

May you clarify, oh, Tirumāl, if your crown aglow  
Is but the upward expansion of your facial glow,  
Your lotus seat, but the reflection of you- dazzling feet  
And the many jewels on Your person and silken garment,  
But the reflection of the glow on your waist radiant.

**Note**

The above poser of the Āḻvār is the result of his observation of the Lord’s bewitching chaim, in His iconic manifestation as Aḻakar, in conjunction with the jewels adorning Him, so well matched that the Āḻvār sees the crown as but an upward expansion of the effulgence on the Lord’s face. At the other end, the lotus seat on which the Lord’s feet are poised seems to be but a reflection of the effulgence on the Lord’s feet. Perhaps, there are no Jewels as such and the jewels that are seen are but a manifestation of the brilliant complexion of the Lord’s body and the flowing silken robe is, likewise, the reflection of the lustre around the Lord’s waist. In short, it is the Lord’s native charm and brilliance that pervade all round and give the beholder the impression that the Lord is bedecked with numerous Jewels and donning the silken robes. Even the ‘Nityās’, the ever-free angels in heaven, share this stunning experience with the Āḻvār who thus moves in good company. Indeed it is not too much to say that the Lord Himself is not aware of the precise extent of His charm and prowess.
