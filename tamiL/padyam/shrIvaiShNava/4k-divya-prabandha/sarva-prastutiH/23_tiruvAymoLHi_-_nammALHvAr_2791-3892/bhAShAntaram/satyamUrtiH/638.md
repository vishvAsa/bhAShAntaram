Unable to reach the holy place of Tiruvallavāḻ, the Āḻvār contemplated the Lord enshrined there, from the outskirts of the holy city, as we saw in the last decad. The Saint thought, he would sustain himself by meditating on Lord Govinda’s (Kṛṣṇa’s) auspicious traits but it made him thaw down. And so, he prays unto the Lord in this decad to grant him at least the stamina to contemplate His glory and sustain himself, even if He would not oblige him with His company. For this purpose, he turns to the Lord in His Incarnate Form (Vibhava), having failed to realise his longing for communion with the Lord in His Area (iconic) Form, in successive pilgrim centres.

On the face of it, the Āḻvār would appear to be moving in the reverse gear. The Lord’s Area (Workshippable) Form is intended to overcome the formidable handicaps and obstacles that confront one in worshipping Him in any of His other aspects of ‘Para’, ‘Vyūha’, Vibhava’ and ‘Antaryāmi’. And yet, the Alvar has recourse to the Lord’s Incarnations, overlooking the time-lag, for the simple reason that the devotees could mingle with the Lord freely, converse and embrace during His Avatāras, unlike the ‘Arca’ where such exchanges are not possible, resulting in the Āḻvār’s frustration. Even among the Incarnations it is noteworthy that all the Āḻvārs had a partiality for Kṛṣṇa. The illustrious Parāśara Bhaṭṭar explained this special preference, as follows:

The grief caused by one’s bereavement loses its intensity with the passage of time, while the pangs are very acute when it is fresh. To the Āḻvārs, Kṛṣṇāvatāra was the nearest in point of time and hence, their lamentations. In the case of Saint Nammāḻvār, in particular, he missed the Kṛṣṇāvatāra by a bare six weeks. Tradition has it that he came into this world just forty three days after Lord Kṛṣṇa’s ascension to the Celestium. The Āḻvār cursed himself as a sinner, born six weeks late, missing the Kṛṣṇāvatāra like unto a delicious dish hitting the teeth and falling to the ground, while attempting to eat it. It was as if Kṛṣṇa had left the pastoral township of Tiruvāyppāṭi by the North gate even as the Āḻvār was entering the place by the South gate.
