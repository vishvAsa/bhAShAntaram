**Tamil text and transliteration:**

எனக்கு ஆராஅமுதாய் எனதுஆவியை இன்உயிரை  
மனக்குஆராமை மன்னி உண்டிட்டாய் இனிஉண்டொழியாய்  
புனக்காயாநிறத்த புண்டரீகக்கண் செங்கனிவாய்  
உனக்குஏற்கும் கோலமலர்ப்பாவைக்கு அன்பா! என்அன்பேயோ!

eṉakku ārāamutāy eṉatuāviyai iṉuyirai  
maṉakkuārāmai maṉṉi uṇṭiṭṭāy iṉiuṇṭoḻiyāy  
puṉakkāyāniṟatta puṇṭarīkakkaṇ ceṅkaṉivāy  
uṉakkuēṟkum kōlamalarppāvaikku aṉpā! eṉaṉpēyō!

**English translation of verse 10.10.6:**

Oh, Lord of lily hue, lotus eyes and reddish lips beautiful!  
Dear unto the lotus-born Divine Mother, matching You so well,  
Unto me You are love incarnate, the nectar insatiable,  
You did consume alike my material body and soul delectable  
And still feel that You didn’t have Your heart’s fill,  
You have perforce to consume what remains of me still.

**Notes:**

\(i\) If the Lord loved His Consort, Mahālakṣmī intensely, He was the very personification of love unto the Āḻvār. That being the case, the Āḻvār rightly points out to the Lord that He can ill-afford to despise him now.

\(ii\) Unlike the nectar that was once churned from the Milkocean and distributed to the Devas, the Āḻvār enjoys the Lord’s nectarean charm, in an ever increasing measure, it being ever fesh [fresh?] and inexhaustible. What a grand setting indeed! The lotus-born Mahālakṣmi, a perfect match unto the Lord of exquisite charm, of the complexion of the lily in fresh bloom, the eyes resembling the red lotus flower, just blossomed, and the lips, radiant like the red fruit. The Divine Mother is “Bhagavan Nārāyaṇa abhimatānurūpa”, as stated by Śrī Rāmānuja in the opening line of ‘Śaraṇāgathi Gadya’. She is both ‘Abhimatha’ (dear) and ‘Anurūpa’ (a good match) unto Lord Nārāyaṇa.

\(iii\) The Lord’s fascination for the Āḻvār did not stop with his soul but extended to his physical body, as well. Even so, there was no satiety for Him and seeing this, the Āḻvār would urge Him to go the whole hog out and consume him, in full, without throwing him out, half way through.
