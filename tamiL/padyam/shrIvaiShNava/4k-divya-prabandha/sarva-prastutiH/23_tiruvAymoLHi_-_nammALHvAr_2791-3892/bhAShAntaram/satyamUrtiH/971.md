**English translation of verse 8.5.2:**

Many a time did I call you out, with dried up eyes  
And lips parched up, that You do before me appear  
Like unto a dark, rising Sun, shedding the lustre rare,  
Like the saphire grand, sporting Your radiant crown, neatly poised  
On locks beaming like a lovely mountain, just sprung up;  
Alas! for me to behold but once, You don’t turn up,  
Stricken with [shame](/definition/shame#history "show shame definitions"), fatigued do I on this good Earth languish.

**Notes:**

\(i\) The eyes have become dry and worn out, looking for the Lord in all directions, hoping that He might come from any direction; the lips have become parched up, by calling Him out frequently. The [Āḻvār](/definition/aḻvar#vaishnavism "show Āḻvār definitions")’s stinging shame is due to the Lord not turning up, even though he had not called him for trivial personal gains but merely for the pleasure of beholding Him. This might make the worldlings look at him askance, in a derisive spirit, that it is such an unresponsive Lord, he is madly after. The expression ‘Good Earth’ could either be in the ironical sense, indicating its notriety indirectly, or might mean, as Piḷḷān would put it, that the Earth is really a good place for all but the Āḻvār, inasmuch as all others presumably enjoy the Lord, quietly as could be iṉferred from their not calling Him out, as the Āḻvār does. It seems the Āḻvār is the solitary soul, left without such enjoyment and, therefore, [crying](/definition/crying#history "show crying definitions") out, as he has been doing.

\(ii\) The Sun, rising over the [emerald](/definition/emerald#history "show emerald definitions") mount, appears to be dark and the Lord’s person is like an emerald mountain and hence, the imagery.
