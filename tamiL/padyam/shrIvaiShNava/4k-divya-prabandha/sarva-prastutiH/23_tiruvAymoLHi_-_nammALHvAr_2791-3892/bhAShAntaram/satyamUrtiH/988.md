**Tamil text and transliteration:**

கூத்தஅம்மான் கொடியேன்இடர் முற்றவும்  
மாய்த்தஅம்மான் மதுசூத அம்மான்உறை  
பூத்தபொழில்தண் திருக்கடித் தானத்தை  
ஏத்தநில்லா குறிக்கொள்மின் இடரே.

kūttaammāṉ koṭiyēṉiṭar muṟṟavum  
māyttaammāṉ matucūta ammāṉuṟai  
pūttapoḻiltaṇ tirukkaṭit tāṉattai  
ēttanillā kuṟikkoḷmiṉ iṭarē.

**English translation of verse 8.6.6:**

Tirukkaṭittāṉam, the holy centre, cool and nice, amid orchards, in full bloom,  
Where resides my Lord of wondrous deeds, Matucūtaṉ, my Sire,  
Who did, in full, destroy the miseries of this sinner dire,  
Will set at naught our miseries, one and all, be sure,  
The moment we adore it, with love supreme.

**Notes:**

Lest the preceding song should give some the impression that the pilgrim centre, known as Tirukkaṭittāṉam, has ceased to exist as such, having entered the Āḻvār’s heart, *en masse* the Āḻvār now calls upon his fellow-beings to worship the holy centre. As already elaborated upon in the notes below the second song of this decad, the pilgrim centres acquire importance, firstly, as places adored by the Lord’s devotees and hence loved by the Lord as well, and secondly, as the centres of attraction helping the Lord to reclaim His subjects, by making them God-bent and hence gratefully loved by the Lord.
