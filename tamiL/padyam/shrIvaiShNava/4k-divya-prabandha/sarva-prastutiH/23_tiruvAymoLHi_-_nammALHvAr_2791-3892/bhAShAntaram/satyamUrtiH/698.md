**Tamil text and transliteration:**

இகல் கொள் புள்ளைப் பிளந்ததும் இமில் ஏறுகள் செற்றதுவும்,  
உயர் கொள் சோலைக் குருந்து ஒசித்ததும் உட்பட மற்றும்பல,  
அகல் கொள் வையம் அளந்த மாயன் என்னப்பன் தன் மாயங்களே,  
பகல் இராப் பரவப் பெற்றேன் எனக்கு என்ன மனப் பரிப்பே?

ikal koḷ puḷḷaip piḷantatum imil ēṟukaḷ ceṟṟatuvum,  
uyar koḷ cōlaik kuruntu ocittatum uṭpaṭa maṟṟumpala,  
akal koḷ vaiyam aḷanta māyaṉ eṉṉappaṉ taṉ māyaṅkaḷē,  
pakal irāp paravap peṟṟēṉ eṉakku eṉṉa maṉap parippē?

**English translation of verse 6.4.6:**

Blest am I to laud, day and night, the wondrous deeds  
Of my mysterious Lord Who spanned all the worlds,  
Tore into twain the beak of the demoniac bird, controlled  
The unruly bulls and slew, ‘tween the twin trees rolled  
And pulled them down, these and many more wonders;  
Could there for me be mental affliction any longer?

**Note**

A demon, set upon child Kṛṣṇa by Kaṃsa, stood on the bank of the river Yamuna, in the form of a gigantic stork and swallowed the Divine Child Who, however, blistered the stomach of the bird. Unable to bear the torture inside, the devil spat the child out and was about to peck at Him with its beak, when the latter took time by the forelock and split the bird’s beak into two and killed it. In his ‘Yādavābhyudhayam Śrī Vedānta Deśika says that the bird was of formidable proportions, looking like a winged Kailās mountin, creeping slowly and that, after it was slain, its plumes were tied up, here and there, by the shepherd boys, as a warning signal for evil-doers, with sinister designs on the Divine child.
