அருள்தான் இனியான் அறியேன் அவன்என்உள்  
இருள்தான்அற வீற்றிருந்தான் இதுஅல்லால்  
பொருள் தான்எனில் மூவுலகும் பொருளல்ல  
மருள்தான் ஈதோ? மாயமயக்கு மயக்கே.

aruḷtāṉ iṉiyāṉ aṟiyēṉ avaṉeṉuḷ  
iruḷtāṉaṟa vīṟṟiruntāṉ ituallāl  
poruḷ tāṉeṉil mūvulakum poruḷalla  
maruḷtāṉ ītō? māyamayakku mayakkē.

**English translation of verse 8.7.3:**

Indeed, I know of no grace but that of the Lord.  
Who does inside me stay, dispelling the darkness within;  
It seems I am unto Him the sole concern,  
He values not so much even His overlordship of the three worlds.  
Is it yet another mystery of His or a mere illusion?

**Notes:**

Overwhelmed by the immensity of the Lord’s love unto him, the [Āḻvār](/definition/aḻvar#vaishnavism "show Āḻvār definitions") feels it to be too good to be true and even suspects that it might be just an illusion.

In the preceding song, the Āḻvār deemed it an incomparable act of grace galore, on the part of the Lord to have subjugated his unrelenting senses and destroyed them. But now, he says even that dwindles down before the loving condescension with which He has got Himself lodged in the Āḻvār’s heart, dispelling its erstwhile darkness. What is more, the Lord’s condescension is full and complete, seeing that, in His boundless love for the Āḻvār, He has relegated even His overlordship of the Universe to a secondary place. In his unique diction, Nampiḻḷai puts it, that the Āḻvār says here “Alas! the Lord had kept me in a state of bewilderment all along, caught up in the vortex of ‘[Prakṛti](/definition/prakriti#vaishnavism "show Prakṛti definitions")’ ([Māyā](/definition/maya#vaishnavism "show Māyā definitions")) and now again. He keeps me bewildered by His extra-ordinary love unto me.”
