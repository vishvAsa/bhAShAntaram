**Tamil text and transliteration:**

எளிதாயினவாறுஎன்று என்கண்கள் களிப்பக்  
களிதாகிய சிந்தையனாய்க் களிக்கின்றேன்  
கிளிதாவிய சோலைகள்சூழ் திருப்பேரான்  
தெளிதாகிய சேண்விசும்பு தருவானே.

eḷitāyiṉavāṟueṉṟu eṉkaṇkaḷ kaḷippak  
kaḷitākiya cintaiyaṉāyk kaḷikkiṉṟēṉ  
kiḷitāviya cōlaikaḷcūḻ tiruppērāṉ  
teḷitākiya cēṇvicumpu taruvāṉē.

**English translation of verse 10.8.4:**

The Lord dwelling in Tiruppēr, surrounded by orchards lovely,  
The home of parrots, is on the point of bestowing on me  
The immaculate Heaven of splendour great; rejoice do my eyes  
That the high Heaven is brought by the Lord’s grace  
Within my easy reach and my mind with joy does dance.

**Notes:**

\(i\) *The home of parrots*: This refers to the lovely gardens in Tiruppēr, where parrots are perched merrily. This could also refer to the township of Tiruppēr, inhabited by truth-loving, knowledgeable persons who would parrot-like repeat what they had gathered from their preceptors, without any distortion or deviation.

\(ii\) From this land of dark nescience to the yonder land of perpetual clarity and brightness, it is indeed a far cry. And yet, the Lord, in His unbounded grace, has come forward to grant the Āḻvār, Heaven. The Āḻvār is aghast with wonder at that what would otherwise be extremely difficult of attainment is now brought by the Lord within his easy reach, indeed the Lord’s grace galore. The Āḻvār’s eyes beam with joy and so does his mind.
