**Tamil text and transliteration:**

திகழ்கின்ற திருமார்பில் திருமங்கை தன்னோடும்  
திகழ்கின்ற திருமாலார் சேர்விடம்தண் வாட்டாறு  
புகழ்நின்ற புள்ஊர்தி போர்அரக்கர் குலம்கெடுத்தான்  
இகழ்வுஇன்றி என்நெஞ்சத்து எப்பொழுதும் பிரியானே.

tikaḻkiṉṟa tirumārpil tirumaṅkai taṉṉōṭum  
tikaḻkiṉṟa tirumālār cērviṭamtaṇ vāṭṭāṟu  
pukaḻniṉṟa puḷūrti pōrarakkar kulamkeṭuttāṉ  
ikaḻvuiṉṟi eṉneñcattu eppoḻutum piriyāṉē.

**English translation of verse 10.6.9:**

How is it, Tirumāl on Whose resplendent chest does Tirumaṅkai beam,  
Who dwells in cool Tiruvāṭṭāṟu, Who plies the bird of standing fame,  
As His vehicle, Who the militant Asuras did blast,  
Stays forever in my despicable heart, with no disgust?

**Notes:**

\(i\) Surely, it is the farthest limit up to which the Lord’s love for His devotees could go; the Lord has chosen to stay firmly and, for ever, in the Āḻvār’s despicable heart, without the slightest disgust or uneasiness.

\(ii\) The Lord, Who has got lodged on His winsome chest Lakṣmī, the Goddess of affluence, stays in cool Tiru-vāṭṭāṟu, with Garuḍa, famed as the very embodiment of Vedas, as His favourite mount. And yet, one of such peerless eminence has chosen to stay, firm and fast, in the Āḻvār’s heart, as if He has nowhere else to go, rather, does not like to go anywhere else. What is at the bottom of this massive love of the Lord? Well, this is what is exercising the Āḻvār’s mind at the moment.
