**Tamil text and transliteration:**

சீர் கண்டுகொண்டு திருந்து நல் இன்கவி,  
நேர்பட யான் சொல்லும் நீர்மை இலாமையில்,  
ஏர்வு இலா என்னைத் தன்னாக்கி என்னால் தன்னைப்,  
பார் பரவு இன்கவி பாடும் பரமரே.

cīr kaṇṭukoṇṭu tiruntu nal iṉkavi,  
nērpaṭa yāṉ collum nīrmai ilāmaiyil,  
ērvu ilā eṉṉait taṉṉākki eṉṉāl taṉṉaip,  
pār paravu iṉkavi pāṭum paramarē.

**English translation of verse 7.9.5:**

The Lord Supreme blest me, least competent to hymn,  
Thro’ songs, sweet and pure, deeply absorbed in Him,  
And the medium effective made of me, with Him on a par  
To sing and spread His glory throughout the land, near and far.

**Note**

The Āḻvār says that he was not qualified to compose poems, as he did not have any poetic talent worth the name, and even assuming that he could compose poemṣ, he was hardly eligible to sing the Lord’s glory, as he didn’t know a wee wit of His greatness and grandeur. But what has the Lord done? He has instilled in the Āḻvār the requisite knowledge and qualities and elevated him on a par with Him. The Lord sings through the Āḻvār and yet looks upon him as the Poet, *par excellence*. The Saint acknowledges this great gesture of the Lord Whose magnanimity knows no bounds, with melting tenderness of heart. Indeed, no further evidence is needed to establish the Lord’s greatness.
