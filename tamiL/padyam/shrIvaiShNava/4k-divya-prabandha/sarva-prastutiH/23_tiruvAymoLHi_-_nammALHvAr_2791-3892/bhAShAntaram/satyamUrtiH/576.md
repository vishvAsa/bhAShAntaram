**[Tamil](/definition/tamil#history "show Tamil definitions") text and transliteration:**

நீயும் பாங்கு அல்லைகாண் நெஞ்சமே நீள் இரவும்  
ஓயும் பொழுது இன்றி ஊழி ஆய் நீண்டதால்  
காயும் கடும் சிலை என் காகுத்தன் வாரானால்  
மாயும் வகை அறியேன் வல்வினையேன் பெண் பிறந்தே

nīyum pāṅku allaikāṇ neñcamē nīḷ iravum  
ōyum poḻutu iṉṟi ūḻi āy nīṇṭatāl  
kāyum kaṭum cilai eṉ kākuttaṉ vārāṉāl  
māyum vakai aṟiyēṉ valviṉaiyēṉ peṇ piṟantē

**English translation of verse 5.4.3:**

You too, my mind, do not with me co-operate;  
Like unto eternity does the longish night further elongate;  
Kākuttaṉ, whose stern bow does the enemies annihilate,  
Appears not before me; this fell sinner knows not  
How to end this [life](/definition/life#history "show life definitions"), born a woman, alas! what’s my lot?

#### Note

The Nāyakī is in the same predicament as [Sītā](/definition/sita#vaishnavism "show Sītā definitions") during her captivity in [Laṅkā](/definition/lanka#vaishnavism "show Laṅkā definitions"). Sītā lamented that there was none in that hostile land who could help her with poison or a sharp knife to end her miserable life. There at least, Sītā could hear the heartening sound from [Śrī Rāma](/definition/shrirama#history "show Śrī Rāma definitions")’s (Kākuttaṉ’s) bow in the nearby [battlefield](/definition/battle-field#history "show battlefield definitions"), which disillusioned her and set her mind at ease, when [Rāvaṇa](/definition/ravana#vaishnavism "show Rāvaṇa definitions") produced the illusory head of [Rāma](/definition/rama#vaishnavism "show Rāma definitions") and wanted her to believe that Rāma had been [killed](/definition/killing#history "show killed definitions") and his head severed. And now, Rāma does not come and present Himself before the Nāyakī. Her own mind, the principal accessory, does not subserve her, the darksome night, interminably long, aggravates her misery and above all, a woman that she is, with no independence, she is not free to die at will, by putting an end to her life.
