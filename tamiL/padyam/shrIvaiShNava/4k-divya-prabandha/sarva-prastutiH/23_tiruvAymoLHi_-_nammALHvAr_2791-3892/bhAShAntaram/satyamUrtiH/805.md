**Tamil text and transliteration:**

பால துன்பங்கள் இன்பங்கள் படைத்தாய்! பற்றிலார் பற்றநின்றானே,  
காலசக்கரத்தாய்! கடல்இடம் கொண்ட கடல்வண்ணா! கண்ணனே! என்னும்,  
சேல்கொள் தண்புனல்சூழ் திருவரங்கத்தாய்! என்னும் என்தீர்த்தனே என்னும்,  
கோலமா மழைக்கண் பனிமல்க இருக்கும் என்னுடைக் கோமளக் கொழுந்தே

pāla tuṉpaṅkaḷ iṉpaṅkaḷ paṭaittāy! paṟṟilār paṟṟaniṉṟāṉē,  
kālacakkarattāy! kaṭaliṭam koṇṭa kaṭalvaṇṇā! kaṇṇaṉē! eṉṉum,  
cēlkoḷ taṇpuṉalcūḻ tiruvaraṅkattāy! eṉṉum eṉtīrttaṉē eṉṉum,  
kōlamā maḻaikkaṇ paṉimalka irukkum eṉṉuṭaik kōmaḷak koḻuntē

**English translation of verse 7.2.7:**

Says my tender darling, her eyes, cool and lovely, filled with tears,  
“Oh, Distributor of weal and woe among your creatures,  
Even unto those who seek not refuge in you, you are the Protector,  
Oh, Controller of the wheel of Time, the Milk-ocean is your abode,  
Oh, sea-hued Lord, Oh, Kaṇṇā, You that in Tiruvaraṅkam do reside,  
Amid cool waters full of fish, You, my Sanctifier, and so on.

**Notes:**

The Nāyakī’s address, as above, quoted by the Mother, when analysed, would reveal her trend of thought as follows:

\(i\) My Lord, You are known to inflict miseries on the ungodly and regale the devout. Perhaps, you have excluded me from the scope of such a dispensation.

\(ii\) My Lord, You carry the credential that you extend protection even to those who do not submit themselves as such to your protection (Aśaraṇya Śaraṇyah) and yet, you torment me like this. Paradoxically, a prickly plant has been glorified as a grand tree, like unto the wish-yielding tree.

\(iii\) Oh, Lord, if you mean to say that the propitious time for my succour has not yet arrived, may I point out to you that time is at your beck and call?

\(iv\) Reference to Lord Raṅganātha, in the midst of cool waters, full of fish, points to the Nāyakī’s incapacity to stay apart from Him even as fish can’t stay out of water. And yet, can He afford to Keep away from the Nāyakī?

\(v\) “*You, my Sanctifier*!” The Lord has instilled in the Nāyakī sanctity, by way of endowing her with the firm conviction that He is her sole Saviour, a belief which remains unshaken, even in the most desperate situation.

\(vi\) *Tender darling* like unto a creeper which can thrive only when it twists round a pole, firm and fixed, like unto the Lord Himself. The mother says, her daughter is shedding tears in plenty, unable to endure her separation from the Lord. Actually, it was on account of His indefatigable efforts that He has been able to induct in her such assiduous love for Him and yet, He would not come and see for Himself, the fruits of His labour!
