**Tamil text and transliteration:**

எனக்கு நல்அரணை எனதுஆருயிரை இமையவர் தந்தைதாய் தன்னை  
தனக்கும் தன் தன்மை அறிவரியானை தடம்கடல்பள்ளி அம்மானை  
மனக்கொள்சீர் மூவாயிரவர் வண்சிவனும் அயனும்தானும் ஒப்பார்வாழ்  
கனக்கொள் திண்மாடத் திருச்செங்குன்றூரில் திருச்சிற்றாறு அதனுள்கண்டேனே.

eṉakku nalaraṇai eṉatuāruyirai imaiyavar tantaitāy taṉṉai  
taṉakkum taṉ taṉmai aṟivariyāṉai taṭamkaṭalpaḷḷi ammāṉai  
maṉakkoḷcīr mūvāyiravar vaṇcivaṉum ayaṉumtāṉum oppārvāḻ  
kaṉakkoḷ tiṇmāṭat tirucceṅkuṉṟūril tirucciṟṟāṟu ataṉuḷkaṇṭēṉē.

**English translation of verse 8.4.6:**

My haven safe, my sole Sustainer, the All-in-one unto Celestials,  
He, who can’t gauge His own disposition (unfathomable),  
He, who does on the ocean vast repose, I could envision  
In Tirucceṅkuṉṟūṟ Tirucciṟṟāṟu, abounding in solid mansions  
And Brahmins numbering three thousand, potent like the mighty Civaṉ,  
And Ayaṉ, in whose whose hearts the Lord stands enshrined.

**Notes:**

\(i\) It may be recalled that, as already mentioned in the preamble to this decad, the Lord pacified the Āḻvār and disarmed him of his fears, by pointing out to him this very setting. The Lord is safe and sound in this pilgrim centre, surrounded by three thousand brahmins who are as potent as Brahmā and Śivā and could as well discharge the functions assigned by the Lord to those exalted functionaries, c.f. Śloka 20 of Āḷavantār’s Stotra Ratna—

> “tvadāśritānaam jagadudbhavasthiti, praṇāsa > saṃsāra > vimocanadayaḥ bhavanti leela,”

Which means:

> “The creation, preservation and dissolution of the universe, release > from family > bondage > etc., constitute the sporting activities of Your devotees themselves”.

\(ii\) These Brahmins, immersed in devout contemplation of the Lord’s numerous auspicious traits, are ever alert to the impending danger, studiously safeguarding the Deity of their hearts. They are on a par with Sage Bharadvāja, who was apprehensive of the safety of Śrī Rāma and party in exile, during the interval between their first meeting with him and their subsequent return after vanquishing Rāvaṇa.
