**Tamil text and transliteration:**

அன்றுமண் நீர்எரிகால் விண் மலைமுதல்,  
அன்று சுடர் இரண்டு பிறவும், பின்னும்  
அன்று மழை உயிர் தேவும் மற்றும், அப்பன்  
அன்று முதல் உலகம் செய்ததுமே

aṉṟumaṇ nīrerikāl viṇ malaimutal,  
aṉṟu cuṭar iraṇṭu piṟavum, piṉṉum  
aṉṟu maḻai uyir tēvum maṟṟum, appaṉ  
aṉṟu mutal ulakam ceytatumē

**English translation of verse 7.4.9:**

When the Lord first created the worlds,  
The elements five, the mountains and other things were ushered.  
All at once and so were the Sun, Moon and Stars,  
That very moment came up the clouds that shower  
Rains and the lives they sustain, all things still and mobile.  
And the minor deities, oh, what a marvel!

**Notes:**

This song could refer either to the initial creation of the worlds with their diverse contents as one of His great achievements or be treated as a follow-up of the preceding song, dealing with the subjugation of Bāṇāsura by Lord Kṛṣṇa. The Lord’s creation became worth its while, only when He subdued Bāṇāsura and quelled his hauteur galore, cropprotection does indeed form an integral part of crop-cultivation.
