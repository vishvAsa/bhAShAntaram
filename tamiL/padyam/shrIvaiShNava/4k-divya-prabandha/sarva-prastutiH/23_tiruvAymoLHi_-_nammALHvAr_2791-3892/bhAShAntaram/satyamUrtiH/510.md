**[Tamil](/definition/tamil#history "show Tamil definitions") text and transliteration:**

கொள் என்று கிளர்ந்து எழுந்த பெரும் செல்வம் நெருப்பு ஆக,  
கொள் என்று தமம் மூடும் இவை என்ன உலகு இயற்கை?  
வள்ளலே! மணிவண்ணா! உன கழற்கே வரும்பரிசு,  
வள்ளல் செய்து அடியேனை உனது அருளால் வாங்காயே.

koḷ eṉṟu kiḷarntu eḻunta perum celvam neruppu āka,  
koḷ eṉṟu tamam mūṭum ivai eṉṉa ulaku iyaṟkai?  
vaḷḷalē! maṇivaṇṇā! uṉa kaḻaṟkē varumparicu,  
vaḷḷal ceytu aṭiyēṉai uṉatu aruḷāl vāṅkāyē.

**English translation of verse 4.9.4:**

Bounteous Lord of sapphire hue, may Your benevolent grace  
On me alight and lift me up to Your feet!  
How impudent is this world, in nescience steeped,  
Madly after the riches elusive, which only gut  
The whole lot like the fire well ablaze!

**Notes:**

\(i\) Material wealth is a virtual man-killer, being open to the hazards of theft, arson and even murder, not to speak of the rank jealousy it kindles in the have-nots, friends and the relations and the disastrous results that follow. In short, the so-called earthly riches literally [burn](/definition/burning#history "show burn definitions") down the wielders, like fire which [burns](/definition/burning#history "show burns definitions") out whatever it gets hold of. The worldlings are fully aware of the potential harm of the riches and yet, truly characteristic of the ‘tamas’, darkness that envelops their minds, they do not profit by this knowledge but madly run after the mundane wealth and perish. Persistence in mistakes without profiting by the experience of their own and others is a fundamental characteristic of ‘tamas’ which dominates these unwary people, who would tumble, during nights, into the very pits which they had clearly seen by day.

\(ii\) It is indeed His unbounded generosity, that the Lord presents His exquisite Form of Sapphire hue!
