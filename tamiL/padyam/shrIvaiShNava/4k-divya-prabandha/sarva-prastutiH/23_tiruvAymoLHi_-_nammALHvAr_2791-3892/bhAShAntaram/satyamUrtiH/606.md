**[Tamil](/definition/tamil#history "show Tamil definitions") text and transliteration:**

வந்தருளி என் நெஞ்சு இடம் கொண்ட வானவர் கொழுந்தே! உலகுக்கு ஓர்-  
முந்தைத் தாய் தந்தையே! முழு ஏழ் உலகும் உண்டாய்!  
செந்தொழிலவர் வேத வேள்வி அறாச் சிரீவரமங்கலநகர்  
அந்தம் இல் புகழாய்! அடியேனை அகற்றேலே.

vantaruḷi eṉ neñcu iṭam koṇṭa vāṉavar koḻuntē! ulakukku ōr-  
muntait tāy tantaiyē! muḻu ēḻ ulakum uṇṭāy!  
centoḻilavar [vēta](/definition/veta#history "show vēta definitions") vēḷvi aṟāc cirīvaramaṅkalanakar  
antam il pukaḻāy! aṭiyēṉai akaṟṟēlē.

**English translation of verse 5.7.7:**

Oh, Chief of Celestials, You deigned to come and lodge  
In my heart; oh, Primate, You sustained, (during the [Deluge](/definition/deluge#history "show Deluge definitions")),  
All the worlds in Your stomach and now Your limitless grace  
You do shed in Cirīvaramaṅkai where the pious ones  
Of good deeds are in [vedic](/definition/veda#vaishnavism "show vedic definitions") rituals engaged;  
Pray, despise not this vassal, my Lord.

#### Notes

\(i\) In the preceding song, the [Āḻvār](/definition/aḻvar#vaishnavism "show Āḻvār definitions") longed to see the Lord in His Iconic Form at [Vāṉamāmalai](/definition/vanamamalai#vaishnavism "show Vāṉamāmalai definitions"), right where he was (inside the hollow of the tamarind [tree](/definition/tree#history "show tree definitions") in [Āḻvār Tirunakari](/definition/alvar-tirunakari#vaishnavism "show Āḻvār Tirunakari definitions") [temple](/definition/temple#history "show temple definitions")). But the Lord has not responded yet, giving room for the Āḻvār’s apprehension of indifference on His part and hence he prays now that he should not be despised and denied the favour sought by him.

\(ii\) This song, where the Āḻvār gratefully acknowledges the boundless grace of the Lord of the Celestials in choosing his heart as His habitat, is said to have had a special appeal for Śrī [Parāśara](/definition/parashara#history "show Parāśara definitions") Bhaṭṭar. He asked his disciple, Nañcīyar, to recite this song, and, following it up himself in rapturous strain, he observed with great feeling that it was indeed very nice of Saints like [Nammāḻvār](/definition/nammalvar#vaishnavism "show Nammāḻvār definitions") to have bequeathed such verses of melting tenderness to soften our stony hearts. He added that our hearts which are no better than barren rock, rough and rugged, despite the severest course of discipliṅe and austerity, such as ‘[yama](/definition/yama#vaishnavism "show yama definitions")’ ‘[niyama](/definition/niyama#vaishnavism "show niyama definitions")’ etc, could be mellowed, tempered and liquefied, only by verses like this. Nañcīyar was never tired of relating this incident to his disciples.
