**Tamil text and transliteration:**

இலன் அது உடையன் இது என நினைவு அரியவன்  
நிலனிடை விசும்பிடை உருவினன் அருவினன்  
புலனொடு புலன் அலன், ஒழிவு இலன் பரந்த அந்-  
நலன் உடை ஒருவனை நணுகினம் நாமே.

ilaṉ atu uṭaiyaṉ itu eṉa niṉaivu ariyavaṉ  
nilaṉiṭai vicumpiṭai uruviṉaṉ aruviṉaṉ  
pulaṉoṭu pulaṉ alaṉ, oḻivu ilaṉ paranta an-  
nalaṉ uṭai oruvaṉai naṇukiṉam nāmē.

**English translation of verse 1.1.3:**

Could He be said to possess that one and not this other thing? No, He pervades, without intermission, the entire Universe, the region high up as well as those below the earth at all times; He abides in all non-sentient things (matter), having form and size as well as the formless sentient beings within them all (individual souls), and He is yet beyond the grasp of the senses. Blessed are we to have attained Him of peerless glory!

**Notes**

\(i\) The Lord was revealed in the first stanza, in His transcendental glory in the High Heavens and He is now described as the all-pervasive Internal Controller, dwelling in the heart of every one, even on this side of heaven, the land of dark nescience, for the sustenance of His ‘*līlā-vibhūti*’ or the sportive universe.

\(ii\) Notwithstanding the king’s sovereignty over the entire land, he and his royal consorts lovingly raise orchards and flower gardens as a matter of recreation, and tend them with special care. The sportive universe (*līlā vibhūti*) is a similar creation of the Lord, raised and retained at His volition.
