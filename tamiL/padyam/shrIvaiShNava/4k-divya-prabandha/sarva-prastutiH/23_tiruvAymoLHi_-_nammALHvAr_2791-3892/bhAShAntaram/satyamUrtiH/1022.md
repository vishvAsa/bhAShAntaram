கருமாணிக்க மலைமேல் மணித்தடம் தாமரைக் காடுகள்போல்  
திருமார்வு வாய்கண்கை உந்திகால்உடை ஆடைகள் செய்யபிரான்  
திருமால் எம்மான் செழுநீர்வயல் குட்டநாட்டுத் திருப்புலியூர்  
அருமாயன் பேர்அன்றிப் பேச்சுஇலள் அன்னைமீர்! இதற்கு என்செய்கேனோ. (2)

**English translation of verse 8.9.1:**

She utters not anything but the holy names  
Of the wondrous Lord, difficult to attain, Who remains  
In Kuṭṭanāṭṭu Tiruppuliyur, abounding in [fields](/definition/field#history "show fields definitions") fertile,  
Like unto lush [forests](/definition/forest#history "show forests definitions") which with large lotus flowers bristle,  
Blooming over the crest of a mount of dark [ruby](/definition/ruby#history "show ruby definitions"), His lips lovely,  
Chest, eyes, hands, feet, navel and robes, being red, one and all;  
Ye, elders, I know not what I can do for her, at all.

**Notes:**

\(i\) The mate says that the Nāyakī cannot fix her mind on anything else, having been enthralled by the exquisite beauty of the Lord enshrined in Tiruppuliyūr in [Kuṭṭanāṭu](/definition/kuttanatu#vaishnavism "show Kuṭṭanāṭu definitions") (present [Kerala](/definition/kerala#history "show Kerala definitions") State) and she keeps on [uttering](/definition/uttering#history "show uttering definitions") His names alone. This pilgrim centre is one of the thirteen centres, sung by the [Āḻvārs](/definition/aḻvar#vaishnavism "show Āḻvārs definitions"), in Kerala State. There is another pilgrim centre bearing the same name in the territory comprised in the former [Cōlā](/definition/cola#history "show Cōlā definitions") Kingdom (now [Tamil Nāḍu](/definition/tamilnadu#history "show Tamil Nāḍu definitions")), called [Cōla](/definition/cola#history "show Cōla definitions") Nāṭṭu Tiruppuliyūr. The pilgrim centre covered by this decad, is, therefore, distinctly mentioned as Kuṭṭanāṭṭu Tiruppuliyūr.

\(ii\) There is nothing like a dark ruby, ruby being only red. And yet, the [Āḻvār](/definition/aḻvar#vaishnavism "show Āḻvār definitions") has used this expression, as [poetic](/definition/poetry#history "show poetic definitions") imagery, to project the picture of the Lord of bluish complexion, of generous dimensions, whose chest bearing the Divine Mother ([Mahālakṣmī](/definition/mahalakshmi#vaishnavism "show Mahālakṣmī definitions")), lips, hands, navel, feet and silken robes are all red. This exquisite charm would indeed be beyond the purview of our enjoyment but for His coming and staying in ‘[Arca](/definition/arca#history "show Arca definitions")’ (iconic) manifestation, out of condescending love, induced by Mahālakṣmī, the Divine Consort.
