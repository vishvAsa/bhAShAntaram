**Tamil text and transliteration:**

கருமாணிக்க மலைமேல் மணித்தடம் தாமரைக் காடுகள்போல்  
திருமார்வு வாய்கண்கை உந்திகால்உடை ஆடைகள் செய்யபிரான்  
திருமால் எம்மான் செழுநீர்வயல் குட்டநாட்டுத் திருப்புலியூர்  
அருமாயன் பேர்அன்றிப் பேச்சுஇலள் அன்னைமீர்! இதற்கு என்செய்கேனோ. (2)

karumāṇikka malaimēl maṇittaṭam tāmaraik kāṭukaḷpōl  
tirumārvu vāykaṇkai untikāluṭai āṭaikaḷ ceyyapirāṉ  
tirumāl emmāṉ ceḻunīrvayal kuṭṭanāṭṭut tiruppuliyūr  
arumāyaṉ pēraṉṟip pēccuilaḷ aṉṉaimīr! itaṟku eṉceykēṉō. (2)

**English translation of verse 8.9.1:**

She utters not anything but the holy names  
Of the wondrous Lord, difficult to attain, Who remains  
In Kuṭṭanāṭṭu Tiruppuliyur, abounding in fields fertile,  
Like unto lush forests which with large lotus flowers bristle,  
Blooming over the crest of a mount of dark ruby, His lips lovely,  
Chest, eyes, hands, feet, navel and robes, being red, one and all;  
Ye, elders, I know not what I can do for her, at all.

**Notes:**

\(i\) The mate says that the Nāyakī cannot fix her mind on anything else, having been enthralled by the exquisite beauty of the Lord enshrined in Tiruppuliyūr in Kuṭṭanāṭu (present Kerala State) and she keeps on uttering His names alone. This pilgrim centre is one of the thirteen centres, sung by the Āḻvārs, in Kerala State. There is another pilgrim centre bearing the same name in the territory comprised in the former Cōlā Kingdom (now Tamil Nāḍu), called Cōla Nāṭṭu Tiruppuliyūr. The pilgrim centre covered by this decad, is, therefore, distinctly mentioned as Kuṭṭanāṭṭu Tiruppuliyūr.

\(ii\) There is nothing like a dark ruby, ruby being only red. And yet, the Āḻvār has used this expression, as poetic imagery, to project the picture of the Lord of bluish complexion, of generous dimensions, whose chest bearing the Divine Mother (Mahālakṣmī), lips, hands, navel, feet and silken robes are all red. This exquisite charm would indeed be beyond the purview of our enjoyment but for His coming and staying in ‘Arca’ (iconic) manifestation, out of condescending love, induced by Mahālakṣmī, the Divine Consort.
