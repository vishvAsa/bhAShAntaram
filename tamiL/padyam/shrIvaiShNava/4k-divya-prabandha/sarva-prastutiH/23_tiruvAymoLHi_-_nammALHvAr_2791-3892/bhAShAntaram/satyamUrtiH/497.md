**Tamil text and transliteration:**

நிறையினால் குறைவு இல்லா நெடும் பணைத் தோள் மடப் பின்னை,  
பொறையினால் முலை அணைவான் பொரு விடை ஏழ் அடர்த்து உகந்த,  
கறையினார் துவர் உடுக்கை கடை ஆவின் கழி கோல் கைச்,  
சறையினார் கவராத தளிர் நிறத்தால் குறைவு இலமே

niṟaiyiṉāl kuṟaivu illā neṭum paṇait tōḷ maṭap piṉṉai,  
poṟaiyiṉāl mulai aṇaivāṉ poru viṭai ēḻ aṭarttu ukanta,  
kaṟaiyiṉār tuvar uṭukkai kaṭai āviṉ kaḻi kōl kaic,  
caṟaiyiṉār kavarāta taḷir niṟattāl kuṟaivu ilamē

**English translation of verse 4.8.4:**

This tender leaf-like complexion of mine  
Is by me hardly liked when it holds no attraction  
For (Kṛṣṇa), my Lord, Who His body tends not, whose cloth leathern.  
Bears many a stain, Who, with bamboo pipe and lovely whip,  
Moves about, Who tamed the unruly bulls seven, to grip  
And embrace piṇṇai with shoulders long and feminine perfection.

**Note**

The pastoral life led by the Lord, as Kṛṣṇa, the young cow-herd is vividly described in this song, in all its details. The shepherds wear cloth made of leather, when they move about in the forests tending the cows and calves, as a safeguard against brambles and bushes. The wild fruits they gather in plenty, tie them up in clothes and eat, thereby staining the clothes. They always carry with them the whip to control the cattle and the vessel made of bamboo pipe to hold milk, as and when the cows are milked. They seldom bathed, and even on the few occasions they had some sort of a bath, it was only partial. Even this semblance of a bath, Kṛṣṇa didn’t have, as he had hardly the time for it, tending, as he was, the cattle all the time. This only exemplifies His sole concern for His subjects. The word, ‘Caṟaiyiṉār’, in the text of this song, could mean either the one, not tending his body or the bell the shepherds tie round the waist the tingling sound whereof would guide the movement of the cattle following them.
