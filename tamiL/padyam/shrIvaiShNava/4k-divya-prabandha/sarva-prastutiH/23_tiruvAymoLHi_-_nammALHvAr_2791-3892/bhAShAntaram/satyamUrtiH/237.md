**[Tamil](/definition/tamil#history "show Tamil definitions") text and transliteration:**

கிடந்து இருந்து நின்று அளந்து கேழல் ஆய் கீழ்ப் புக்கு  
இடந்திடும், தன்னுள் கரக்கும் உமிழும்,  
தடம் பெருந் தோள் ஆரத் தழுவும் பார் என்னும்  
மடந்தையை, மால் செய்கின்ற, மால் ஆர் காண்பாரே?

kiṭantu iruntu niṉṟu aḷantu kēḻal āy kīḻp pukku  
iṭantiṭum, taṉṉuḷ karakkum umiḻum,  
taṭam perun tōḷ ārat taḻuvum pār eṉṉum  
maṭantaiyai, māl ceykiṉṟa, māl ār kāṇpārē?

**English translation of verse 2.8.7:**

Lying, sitting and standing, measuring the worlds,  
Getting into the waters deep and lifting up the Earth,  
As the [Boar](/definition/boar#history "show Boar definitions") gigantic, holding with Him all the worlds  
And then spitting them out, embracing dame Earth  
On His broad shoulders complacent, who can comprehend His love for Mother earth?

**Notes**

\(i\) Many indeed are the wondrous deeds of the Lord, done out of His great love for Mother Earth, the Sportive universe (*[Līlā](/definition/lila#vaishnavism "show Līlā definitions") [vibhūti](/definition/vibhuti#vaishnavism "show vibhūti definitions")*).

\(ii\) *Lying, sitting and standing*:

There are several ways of appreciating these postures of the Lord. These are set out below:

> \(a\) *Reclining* on the Milk-ocean, the centre of creative activity, > surrounded by the band of celestials;  
> *Sitting* on the > [serpent](/definition/serpent#history "show serpent definitions") > couch in the High > [Heaven](/definition/heaven#history "show Heaven definitions");  
> *Standing* firm on Mount Tirūvēṅkaṭam, His favourite resort. >
