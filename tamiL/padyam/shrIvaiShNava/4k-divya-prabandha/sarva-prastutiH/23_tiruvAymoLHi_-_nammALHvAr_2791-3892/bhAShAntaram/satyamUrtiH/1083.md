**Tamil text and transliteration:**

ஆகம்சேர் நரசிங்கம்அதுஆகி ஓர்  
ஆகம்வள்உகிரால் பிளந்தான்உறை  
மாகவைகுந்தம் காண்பதற்கு என்மனம்  
ஏகம்எண்ணும் இராப்பகல்இன்றியே (2)

ākamcēr naraciṅkamatuāki ōr  
ākamvaḷukirāl piḷantāṉuṟai  
mākavaikuntam kāṇpataṟku eṉmaṉam  
ēkameṇṇum irāppakaliṉṟiyē (2)

**English translation of verse 9.3.7:**

‘Tween day and night, my mind makes no distinction,  
Yearn it does, all the time, to behold the high Heaven,  
The abode great of the Lord, Who did combine  
Man and lion in a single form and cleaved in twain,  
With nails sharp, yet another form (of Iraṇiyaṉ)

**Notes:**

\(i\) The Āḻvār says that his mind, which revelled in the contemplation of the Lord’s wondrous deeds, now longs to see the Lord in His transcendent glory, in the High Heavens.

\(ii\) It is indeed a very odd combination, outside the realm of possibility, the conjunction of Man and Lion, in a single frame. And yet, the Omnipotent Lord assumed such a Form, in His unbounded zeal for the welfare of Prahlāda, the young devotee, *par excellence*. Deeply implanted in the Āḻvār’s chastened mind, even at that distance of time, was the strange but highly delectable form of the Man-Lion (*Narasiṃha*)
