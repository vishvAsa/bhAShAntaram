**Tamil text and transliteration:**

கூத்தன் கோவலன் குதற்று வல்லசுரர்கள் கூற்றம்  
ஏத்தும் நங்கட்கும் அமரர்க்கும் முனிவர்க்கும் இன்பன்  
வாய்த்த தண்பணை வளவயல்சூழ் திருமோகூர்-  
ஆத்தன் தாமரை அடிஅன்றி மற்றுஇலம் அரணே.

kūttaṉ kōvalaṉ kutaṟṟu vallacurarkaḷ kūṟṟam  
ēttum naṅkaṭkum amararkkum muṉivarkkum iṉpaṉ  
vāytta taṇpaṇai vaḷavayalcūḻ tirumōkūr-  
āttaṉ tāmarai aṭiaṉṟi maṟṟuilam araṇē.

**English translation of verse 10.1.6:**

Shelter have we none but the lotus feet  
Of our Sire at Tirumōkūr, replete  
With paddy fields and water sheds, cool and bright,  
The divine cow-herd of majestic gait,  
Deadly unto the Asuras who would miseries on others inflict;  
Unto us that extol Him and the Devas, He is sweet indeed.

**Notes:**

\(i\) No doubt, Śiva is famous as the great dancer (Naṭarājaṉ), full of thrills, but Lord Rāma’s very gait is said to have been entrancing—c.f. ‘Agrataḥ *prayayau* Rāmaḥ’ (Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa) and equally majestic and enthralling was Lord Kṛṣṇa’s gait.

\(ii\) While the Lord is deadly unto the Asuras who inflict miseries on the devout, He is very dear to His devotees, all alike, making no distinction between the ‘Nitya Sūrīs’ (Eternal Heroes) and the votary just admitted unto His fold. Could there be a greater friend and benefactor than the Lord Who keeps remembering His devotees, all the time, including those last moments of their lives when they remain unconscious and are no better than a piece of stone or log of wood, and conducts them to the highest state (Heaven)?
