**Tamil text and transliteration:**

சோராத எப் பொருட்கும் ஆதியாம் சோதிக்கே,  
ஆராத காதல் குருகூர்ச் சடகோபன்,  
ஓராயிரம் சொன்ன அவற்றுள் இவை பத்தும்,  
சோரார் விடார் கண்டீர் வைகுந்தம் திண்ணனவே.

cōrāta ep poruṭkum ātiyām cōtikkē,  
ārāta kātal kurukūrc caṭakōpaṉ,  
ōrāyiram coṉṉa avaṟṟuḷ ivai pattum,  
cōrār viṭār kaṇṭīr vaikuntam tiṇṇaṉavē.

**English translation of verse 2.1.11:**

Those that are regular in reciting these stanzas ten,  
Out of the thousand composed by Kurukūr Caṭakōpaṉ,  
Of love insatiable for the resplendent Lord, the root cause  
Of one and all, shall surely enjoy for ever, Heavenly bliss.

**Notes**

\(i\) It is only after the Lord came and joined the Āḻvār that He became God indeed, the Protector of oṇe and all, *without any exception*; again, the Lord became resplendent, only after His union with the Āḻvār.

\(ii\) It is also noteworthy that, In this decad, the Āḻvār has come to be identified through his boundless love for the Lord; that is why he is referred to not as mere Kurukūr Caṭakōpaṉ but as Caṭakōpaṉ of insatiable God-love.
