**Tamil text and transliteration:**

ஒன்றும் நில்லா கெடும் முற்றவும் தீவினை உள்ளித் தொழுமின் தொண்டீர்,  
அன்று அங்கு அமர் வென்று உருப்பிணி நங்கை அணி நெடும் தோள் புணர்ந்தான்,  
என்றும் எப்போதும் என் நெஞ்சம் துதிப்ப உள்ளே இருக்கின்ற பிரான்,  
நின்ற அணி திருவாறன்விளை என்னும் நீள் நகரம் அதுவே.

oṉṟum nillā keṭum muṟṟavum tīviṉai uḷḷit toḻumiṉ toṇṭīr,  
aṉṟu aṅku amar veṉṟu uruppiṇi naṅkai aṇi neṭum tōḷ puṇarntāṉ,  
eṉṟum eppōtum eṉ neñcam tutippa uḷḷē irukkiṉṟa pirāṉ,  
niṉṟa aṇi tiruvāṟaṉviḷai eṉṉum nīḷ nakaram atuvē.

**English translation of verse 7.10.6:**

Ye, votaries, all your dire sins will get destroyed  
If you could with reverence meditate on the city great,  
The lovely Tiruvāṟaṉviḷai, where resides the Lord,  
Who once came off with flying colours in a skirmish and caught  
Uruppiṇi, the damsel, bejewelled and enchanting, in embrace tight  
And is in my mind firm, for me always to contemplate.

**Notes:**

\(i\) The Āḻvār beckons the Lord’s votaries to just meditate on holy Tiruvāṟaṉviḷai to get all their ills and evils eradicated, *in totto*. We can, at best, wipe off only an infinitesimal fraction of our sins, through our own efforts, but the Lord’: grace will wipe them off in full.

\(ii\) Uruppiṇi (Rukmiṇi), an incarnation of Māhalakṣmī, was the only daughter of Bhīṣmaka, king of Kuṇṭinam. She had five brothers. When she came of marriagable age, Śrī Kṛṣṇa went and sought out her hand but her brother Rukmaṇ opposed it. Intending that she should be married to Śiśupāla, he arranged for her Svayamvara, when several kings would assemble, from whom the bride could choose the one most eligible. But Rukmiṇi was so resolute that she would marry none but Kṛṣṇa and emboldened by this determination, she even sent a secret epistle to Kṛṣṇa, inviting him to come down at the appropriate moment and take her away some how, from those devils. Śrī Kṛṣṇa accordingly got hold of Rukmiṇi at the crucial moment, and drove her away openly. Śiśupāla and other kings, mustered by Rukman, who encountered Śrī Kṛṣṇa, were beaten off. The infuriated Rukmaṇ, however, pounced upon Kṛṣṇa, bent upon slaying Him and his life was spared by the Lord, at the special request of Rukimiṇi and, poor fellow, he was let off with mere disfigurement. (Śrīmad Bhāgavatam)
