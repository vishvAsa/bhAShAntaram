**English translation of verse 5.7.4:**

The five (brothers) You befriended and had their hundred (cousins) routed,  
It was a battle of wonderful strategy, by you directed;  
My Lord, the Earth You once salvaged and now have You resorted  
To Cirīvaramaṅkalam, inhabited by men of wisdom sound,  
Where [Vedic](/definition/veda#vaishnavism "show Vedic definitions") rituals go on, all the year round;  
You, where and how indeed can I attain?

#### Notes

\(i\) In accordance with the Lord’s avowed creed, He looks upon all impartially, no one is His foe or His favourite on grounds of caste, culture, beauty and temperament.

And yet, the Lord completely identifies Himself with His [lovers](/definition/lover#history "show lovers definitions"), who stand rivetted to Him in thought, word, and deed and He looks upon their enemies as His. That is how, the [Kauravas](/definition/kauravas#vaishnavism "show Kauravas definitions") (hundred brothers) who were hostile to the [Pāṇḍavas](/definition/pandava#vaishnavism "show Pāṇḍavas definitions") (their five cousins), became His enemies.

\(ii\) It was a wonderful battle indeed where devious methods were justifiably adopted to quell the wicked opponents. The Lord is known for upholding truth and justice and yet, if He adopted devious methods for outwitting the wicked opponents, it was perfectly justified.

\(iii\) Even as the Lord condescendingly came down and took His abode in [Vāṉamāmalai](/definition/vanamamalai#vaishnavism "show Vāṉamāmalai definitions") like the pious ones of sound knowledge, who had already settled there and mingled with them delightfully, the [Āḻvār](/definition/aḻvar#vaishnavism "show Āḻvār definitions") wants the Lord to take the initiative in his case also, that is, He should either come down to him or take him up to His feet, adding to the list of many favours already heaped on him.
