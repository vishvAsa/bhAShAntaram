**Tamil text and transliteration:**

கூட்டுண்டு நீங்கிய கோலத்தாமரைக் கண்செவ்வாய்  
வாட்டம்இல்என் கருமாணிக்கம் கண்ணன் மாயன்போல்  
கோட்டிய வில்லொடு மின்னும் மேகக்குழாங்கள்காள்  
காட்டேல்மின் நும்உரு என்உயிர்க்கு அதுகாலனே.

kūṭṭuṇṭu nīṅkiya kōlattāmaraik kaṇcevvāy  
vāṭṭamileṉ karumāṇikkam kaṇṇaṉ māyaṉpōl  
kōṭṭiya villoṭu miṉṉum mēkakkuḻāṅkaḷkāḷ  
kāṭṭēlmiṉ numuru eṉuyirkku atukālaṉē.

**English translation of verse 9.5.7:**

Ye bunches of clouds with lightning streaks that gleam  
Like silvery bows, well bent! show me not your form,  
Which unto my life is like Kālaṉ,the angel of Death, one dreads,  
For you bear the likeness of Kaṇṇaṉ, my mystic Lord,  
Who after His erstwhile union with me has fled,  
Whose sapphire hue, lotus eyes and lips red  
Are, however, in my thoughts for ever.

**Notes:**

\(i\) When the silvery lightning cleaves the bosom of the dark clouds, one cannot but recollect the exquisite form of Lord Kṛṣṇa of Sapphire hue, bedecked with dazzling ornaments. The Nāyakī, therefore, asks the clouds not to present themselves to her, as it would prove fatal to her.

\(ii\) During their erstwhile union, when the Nāyakī and the Lord were locked in tight embrace, it looked as if they would never get parted. But then, the Lord deserted her and, in the process, He stood to gain. Already known for His exquisite charm, each one of His limbs, shone with even greater lustre after His union with the Nāyakī. On the other hand, the Nāyakī fared miserably. The Lord’s desertion has affected her mind and body so much, that the bangles would not rest on her wrists, grown terribly thin, and her natural complexion has faded out alarmingly, decoloration having set in.
