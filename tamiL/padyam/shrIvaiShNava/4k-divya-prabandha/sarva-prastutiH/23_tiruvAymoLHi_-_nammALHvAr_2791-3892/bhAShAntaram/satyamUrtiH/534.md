+++
Through his brilliant exposition of the Lord’s Supremacy, in the last decad, the Āḻvār could wean away the worldlings from propitiating the minor deities and turn their attention to the Supreme Lord (Viṣṇu). The Āḻvār is about to sing the song of benediction for the new state of affairs to flourish in all its glory, vide V-2. Meanwhile, he draws the searchlight inwards to examine the root-cause of the extraordinary grace showered on him by the Lord, whereby he could not merely stand apart from the worldlings without wallowing as one of them, but also advise and correct them. This introspection, however, reveals that even for a mere show of piety by him devoid of genuine love for God, He has condescended to open up the floodgates of His grace on him, without caring in the least to go beneath the skin and expose his hollowness. The Āḻvār just marvels at the Lord’s overwhelming grace and gives vent to his wonderment, in this decad.
