In IV-10, the [Āḻvār](/definition/aḻvar#vaishnavism "show Āḻvār definitions") preached to the world at large the Supremacy of Lord [Viṣṇu](/definition/vishnu#vaishnavism "show Viṣṇu definitions"), in convincing style and thereby weaned the people from propitiating minor deities. The resultant upsurge of devotion to the Supreme Lord converted this abode into a land of bliss, hardly distinguishable from [Heaven](/definition/heaven#history "show Heaven definitions"). This again resulted in a free flow of visitors from Heaven and other upper regions to this land, to behold and admire this new state of affairs. A [golden](/definition/gold#history "show golden definitions") era having thus been ushered in, the Āḻvār hails it in this decad. He also envisaged, with a prophetic vision, the happy preservation and propagation of God-love thus generated, in the coming ages as well, through the advent of the illustrious Tirumaṅkai Āḻvār and Saint [Rāmānujācārya](/definition/ramanujacarya#vaishnavism "show Rāmānujācārya definitions"), the veritable destroyers of the evil forces of [Kaliyuga](/definition/kaliyuga#vaishnavism "show Kaliyuga definitions").
