**Tamil text and transliteration:**

மல்லிகைகமழ் தென்றல் ஈரும்ஆலோ! வண்குறிஞ்சி இசைதவரும்ஆலோ  
செல்கதிர் மாலையும் மயக்கும்ஆலோ! செக்கர்நல் மேகங்கள் சிதைக்கும்ஆலோ  
அல்லிஅம் தாமரைக் கண்ணன் எம்மான் ஆயர்கள்ஏறு அரிஏறு எம்மாயோன்  
புல்லிய முலைகளும் தோளும் கொண்டு புகலிடம் அறிகிலம் தமியம்ஆலோ! (2)

mallikaikamaḻ teṉṟal īrumālō! vaṇkuṟiñci icaitavarumālō  
celkatir mālaiyum mayakkumālō! cekkarnal mēkaṅkaḷ citaikkumālō  
alliam tāmaraik kaṇṇaṉ emmāṉ āyarkaḷēṟu ariēṟu emmāyōṉ  
pulliya mulaikaḷum tōḷum koṇṭu pukaliṭam aṟikilam tamiyamālō! (2)

**English translation of verse 9.9.1:**

Alas! the jasmine scent, the southerly breeze does waft,  
Cuts me across like the unrelenting shaft;  
Ha! the tuneful singing of the birds does my ears pierce,  
The evening Sun just sends me into a trance  
While the pretty clouds, by the crimson sky lit, hack me to pieces;  
Pity, I know not where I can resort  
And survive the lingering memory of my Lord  
Who did my breasts and shoulders in tight embrace hold.  
The shepherd Chief, like unto a lion, with blooming lotus eyes.

**Notes:**

\(i\) The Āḻvār gets into the vein of a Gopī whose pangs of separation from Kṛṣṇa, particularly in view of his delayed home-coming, were aggravated by the cool evening breeze, the setting Sun, crescent sky etc., individually and collectively. What is normally soothing and pleasurable acquires a different complexion altogether and turns out to be a veritable instrument of torture to the lover in a state of desolation. There are quite a few Ślokas in the first Sarga of Kiṣkindhā Kāṇḍa (Rāmāyaṇa), pitched in the same key as this decad.

\(ii\) The approach of night-fall only heightens the gloom, as even that little distraction of mind afforded by the sight of things around, by day, is no longer possible when one is locked up in darkness. The crescent sky and the clouds, seen in that setting, vividly remind the Nāyakī of the exquisite form of the Lord, limb by limb; what then are the chances of her survival through forgetting her erstwhile union with Him?
