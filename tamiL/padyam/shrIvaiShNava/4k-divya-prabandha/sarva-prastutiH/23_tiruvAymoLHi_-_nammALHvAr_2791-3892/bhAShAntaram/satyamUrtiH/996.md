**English translation of verse 8.7.1:**

Vāmaṉaṉ, my Lord, Whose grace I invoked, days on end,  
To lift me unto His [golden](/definition/gold#history "show golden definitions") feet, has, I find,  
Been very Keen Himself to get hold of me and now come  
Right inside me, looking at me, all the time.

**Notes:**

The [Āḻvār](/definition/aḻvar#vaishnavism "show Āḻvār definitions") was beseeching the Lord all along, panting and craving for Him, to come and reign in his heart. This was indeed superfluous for the Lord is even more enamoured of the Āḻvār and He has, all the time, been looking forward to getting hold of the Āḻvār and being firmly lodged in his heart. And now, He has got inside the Āḻvār and He keeps looking at him with doting love, like unto a father who keeps looking at his beloved son, just recovered from a dire [disease](/definition/disease#history "show disease definitions") generally known to be fatal. As a matter of fact, the Āḻvār has survived the deep yearning of his, in VIII-5 (Māyakkūttā) to which he could have as well succumbed. Even as the Lord, as [Vāmana](/definition/vamana#history "show Vāmana definitions"), sought out Mahābali and snatched away his possessions, the Lord sought the Āḻvār and took over from him, his deep longing, and with a longing of even greater intensity, He took hold of the Āḻvār and got inside him.
