**Tamil text and transliteration:**

ஆர்வனோ ஆழிஅங்கை எம் பிரான் புகழ்,  
பார் விண் நீர் முற்றும் கலந்து பருகிலும்,  
ஏர்வு இலா என்னைத் தன்னாக்கி என்னால் தன்னைச்,  
சீர்பெற இன்கவி சொன்ன திறத்துக்கே?

ārvaṉō āḻiaṅkai em pirāṉ pukaḻ,  
pār viṇ nīr muṟṟum kalantu parukilum,  
ērvu ilā eṉṉait taṉṉākki eṉṉāl taṉṉaic,  
cīrpeṟa iṉkavi coṉṉa tiṟattukkē?

**English translation of verse 7.9.8:**

Will I reach the end of satisfaction, if all the worlds,  
Up and down and those in the Milk-ocean assembled  
And praised the Lord, wielding the discus, Who made me laud  
Him, in hymns sweet, raising unto His level me, a mere dud?

**Notes:**

Yet another way of interpreting this song could be as follows: Even if the Āḻvār acquired the combined power of speech of the denizens of Earth, Heaven and the Milk-ocean, and expressed his gratitude for the Lord who chose him as His instrument for singing ‘Tiruvāymoḻi’, he can never reach the end of exhaustion. This is so, because the Lord not merely made the Āḻvār sing His glory, despite the absence of either the inclination or the competence therefor and on the top of that, He felt elated that His glory was heightened by the Āḻvār’s laudation. Even otherwise, the songs He made the Āḻvār sing are so very sweet and before this favour of His, all the others heaped on him pale into insignificance.
