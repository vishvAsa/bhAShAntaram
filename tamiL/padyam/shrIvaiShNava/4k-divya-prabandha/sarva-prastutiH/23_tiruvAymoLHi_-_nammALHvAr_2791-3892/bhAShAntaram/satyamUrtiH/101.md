**[Tamil](/definition/tamil#history "show Tamil definitions") text and transliteration:**

வைகலும் வெண்ணெய், கைகலந்து உண்டான்,  
பொய் கலவாது, என் மெய்கலந்தானே.

vaikalum veṇṇey, kaikalantu uṇṭāṉ,  
poy kalavātu, eṉ meykalantāṉē.

**English translation of verse 1.8.5:**

The Lord stretched His hands as far as He could,  
(Snatched) the butter and ate (as much as He liked);  
Truly, He my body liked in that fashion  
And there ensued the grand fusion.

**Note**

On the one hand, the [Āḻvār](/definition/aḻvar#vaishnavism "show Āḻvār definitions") goes into raptures in contemplation of the Lord’s auspicious attributes and, on the other, the Lord covets the Āḻvār’s body with the same avidity with which He [swallowed](/definition/swallowed#history "show swallowed definitions") butter in [Gokula](/definition/gokula#vaishnavism "show Gokula definitions").
