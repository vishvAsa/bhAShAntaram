**Tamil text and transliteration:**

ஏத்துமின் நமர்காள் என்றுதான் குடம்ஆடு-  
கூத்தனைக் குருகூர்ச் சடகோபன் குற்றேவல்கள்  
வாய்த்த ஆயிரத்துள் இவை வண் திருமோகூர்க்கு  
ஈத்த பத்திவை ஏத்த வல்லார்க்கு இடர் கெடுமே. (2)

ēttumiṉ namarkāḷ eṉṟutāṉ kuṭamāṭu-  
kūttaṉaik kurukūrc caṭakōpaṉ kuṟṟēvalkaḷ  
vāytta āyirattuḷ ivai vaṇ tirumōkūrkku  
ītta pattivai ētta vallārkku iṭar keṭumē. (2)

**English translation of verse 10.1.11:**

The woes shall be gone of those that chant these songs ten,  
Assigned to Tirumōkūr, from out of the thousand of Caṭakōpaṉ  
Of Kurukūr, composed as a piece of service divine,  
Adoring the Lord Who did the pot-dancing great,  
Inviting the pious on-lookers to sing His glory with all their might.

**Notes:**

\(i\) These ten songs have been doled out to Tirumōkūr, out of the thousand composed by the Āḻvār, in adoration of  
Lord Raṅganātha, the cloud-hued Lord enshrined in the walled city of Srirangam, Vide also notes below VII-2-11. The chanters of this decad will be rid of all miseries, including the anxiety to secure a suitable escort, during their ascent to heaven, which is assured to them at the end of the current span of life.

\(ii\) When Lord Kṛṣṇa did the pot-dancing, He exhorted the people around, as follows:

“May those of You that admire my valorous deeds, sing my glory as lustily as your gift of speech can cope with.” This goes to show that the Lord’s deeds were exhilarating unto Him and others alike. Such a Lord is lauded by the Āḻvār through appropriate songs, set in choice diction.
