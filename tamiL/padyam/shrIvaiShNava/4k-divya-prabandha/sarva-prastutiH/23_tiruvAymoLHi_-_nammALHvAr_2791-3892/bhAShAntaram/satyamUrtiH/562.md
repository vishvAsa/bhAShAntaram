**[Tamil](/definition/tamil#history "show Tamil definitions") text and transliteration:**

என் செய்யும் ஊரவர் கவ்வை தோழீ இனி நம்மை  
என் செய்ய தாமரைக் கண்ணன் என்னை நிறை கொண்டான்  
முன் செய்ய மாமை இழந்து மேனி மெலிவு எய்தி  
என் செய்ய வாயும் கருங்கண்ணும் பயப்பு ஊர்ந்தவே.

eṉ ceyyum ūravar kavvai tōḻī iṉi nammai  
eṉ ceyya tāmaraik kaṇṇaṉ eṉṉai niṟai koṇṭāṉ  
muṉ ceyya māmai iḻantu mēṉi melivu eyti  
eṉ ceyya vāyum karuṅkaṇṇum payappu ūrntavē.

**English translation of verse 5.3.2:**

My Lord with red-lotus eyes robbed me of my modesty.  
With my complexion gone, my body is thinning down,  
The hue of my red lips and eyes black is also going down  
What indeed is the reproof of these folks unto me?

**Note**

Queried by her mates as to how she could afford to ignore public opinion and be indifferent to it, the Nāyakī says that she is well past that stage, having lost all sense of awareness of the world long ago, when the Supreme Lord of exquisite charm stole away her heart. Pining for Him, she has thinned down alarmingly and is terribly off-colour. When she recounts these disquieting changes, it is not by way of stating her own loss; these were the things which had once attracted the Lord and the loss is, therefore, His and not hers.
