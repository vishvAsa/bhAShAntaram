**Tamil text and transliteration:**

மூவுலகங்களும் ஆய் அல்லன் ஆய் உகப்பு ஆய் முனிவு ஆய்  
பூவில் வாழ் மகள் ஆய் தவ்வை ஆய் புகழ் ஆய் பழி ஆய்  
தேவர் மேவித் தொழும் திருவிண்ணகர் சேர்ந்த பிரான்  
பாவியேன் மனத்தே உறைகின்ற பரஞ்சுடரே.

mūvulakaṅkaḷum āy allaṉ āy ukappu āy muṉivu āy  
pūvil vāḻ makaḷ āy tavvai āy pukaḻ āy paḻi āy  
tēvar mēvit toḻum tiruviṇṇakar cērnta pirāṉ  
pāviyēṉ maṉattē uṟaikiṉṟa parañcuṭarē.

**English translation of verse 6.3.6:**

The resplendent Lord Supreme Who, in this sinner’s mind resides  
And in Him combines the eternal Heaven and the ephemeral worlds,  
Likes and dislikes, the Goddess of affluence and her number opposite;  
Fame and opprobrium, stays in Tiruviṇṇakar, the Celestials’ resort favourite.

#### Notes

\(i\) The three worlds, with their strange admixture of Satva, Rajas and Tamas, with their inhabitants, bound down by their actions, past and present, liable to dissolution, as well as the Eternal Land (Heaven) in contra-distinction to the Sportive Universe, referred to above, are controlled by the Supreme Lord.

\(ii\) A thing, liked by some, is disliked by some others; the same person might like a thing at one time and dislike it at another. Some are affluent, being the recipients of Lakṣmī’s grace, while others are oppressed by chill penury, due to the lack of such grace. Some are praise worthy while there are others who are condemned as despicable. All these are controlled by the Lord; while He is extolled by the devout, He is condemned by the demoniac.

\(iii\) The Saint calls himself a sinner, recollecting how, in the earlier decad, he had the cheek, the impudence to shut the door against the Lord, when He presented Himself.
