**Tamil text and transliteration:**

ஈடும் எடுப்பும் இல் ஈசன் மாடு விடாது என் மனனே  
பாடும் என் நா அவன் பாடல் ஆடும் என் அங்கம் அணங்கே.

īṭum eṭuppum il īcaṉ māṭu viṭātu eṉ maṉaṉē  
pāṭum eṉ nā avaṉ pāṭal āṭum eṉ aṅkam aṇaṅkē.

**English translation of verse 1.6.3:**

My mind can never be away from Īcaṉ (Lord Supreme),  
Who makes no distinction ‘tween high and low;  
My tongue His glory sings at all times  
While my body danceth in ecstatic glow.

**Notes**

\(i\) The Lord does not extend special favours by reason of one’s high parentage, calibre and conduct, nor does He give up those of low descent, meagre intellect and poor conduct. He is absolutely impartial. †Prahlāda and Vibhīṣaṇa of Asura and Rākṣasa clan, respectively, were among His beneficiaries. If the other Asuras and Rākṣasas came to grief the fault was not with the Lord. It is like a few persons falling, now and then, into the tank dug up for the common good of all and killing themselves.

\(ii\) It is noteworthy that the Āḻvār stands rivetted to the Lord by word, deed and thought.
