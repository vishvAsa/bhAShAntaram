**Tamil text and transliteration:**

ஆயர் கொழுந்தாய் அவரால் புடையுண்ணும்,  
மாயப் பிரானை என் மாணிக்கச் சோதியை,  
தூய அமுதைப் பருகிப் பருகி, என்-  
மாயப் பிறவி மயர்வு அறுத்தேனே.

āyar koḻuntāy avarāl puṭaiyuṇṇum,  
māyap pirāṉai eṉ māṇikkac cōtiyai,  
tūya amutaip parukip paruki, eṉ-  
māyap piṟavi mayarvu aṟuttēṉē.

**English translation of verse 1.7.3:**

I drank and drank, without intermission, the nectar pure,  
The dazzling gem, the mystic Lord of wondrous deeds,  
(Gopāla) the shepherd chief, bound and beaten by cowherds  
(For theft of butter) and got my nescience, matter-born, severed.

**Notes**

\(i\) Speaking about Gopālakṛṣṇa, in the last song, the Āḻvār had before him the entire panorama of His mysterious deeds and by merely meditating on them, he got all his accumulated nescience, born of age-long material contacts, eradicated in *toto*, root and branch.

\(ii\) In the by-gone days, the Devas got nectar subject to various conditions. Even so, it is by no means comparable to the Āḻvār’s uninhibited and unrestricted Divine experience, drinking deep of that pure nectar which cleansed him thoroughly and rooted out his age-long sins sheathed in ignorance.
