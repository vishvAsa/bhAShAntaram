**Tamil text and transliteration:**

பீடு உடை நான்முகனைப் படைத்தானுக்கு,  
மாடு உடை வையம் அளந்த மணாளற்கு,  
நாடு உடை மன்னர்க்குத் தூதுசெல் நம்பிக்கு, என்  
பாடு உடை அல்குல் இழந்தது பண்பே.

pīṭu uṭai nāṉmukaṉaip paṭaittāṉukku,  
māṭu uṭai vaiyam aḷanta maṇāḷaṟku,  
nāṭu uṭai maṉṉarkkut tūtucel nampikku, eṉ  
pāṭu uṭai alkul iḻantatu paṇpē.

**English translation of verse 6.6.4:**

My daughter, with broad tummy, has her natural pose lost,  
Steeped in thoughts of the Lord Who from His navel did create  
The majestic Nāṉmukaṉ (Brahmā). the Spouse Who the rich Earth spanned  
And for the landed monarchs ran an errand.

#### Notes

\(i\) The Nāyakī’s natural composure undergoes alarming modifications, as she keeps meditating on the Lord’s traits, one by one.

\(ii\) Lord Kṛṣṇa ran an errand on behalf of the Pāṇḍavas, who would not be granted by their cousin, Duryodhana, even a square inch of land, not even a chair to sit on. And yet, the Pāṇḍavas are referred to, as the landed monarchs, in this song, as the Lord was on their side. The Nāyaki has just been thrown off her feet by the Lord’s exhibition of such amazing condescension as running an errand and doing the meanest of jobs for His devotees.
