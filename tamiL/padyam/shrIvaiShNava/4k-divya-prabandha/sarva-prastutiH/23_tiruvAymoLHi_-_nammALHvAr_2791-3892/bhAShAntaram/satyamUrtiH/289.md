**[Tamil](/definition/tamil#history "show Tamil definitions") text and transliteration:**

வந்தாய் போலே வந்தும் என் மனத்தினை நீ,  
சிந்தாமல் செய்யாய் இதுவே இது ஆகில்,  
கொந்து ஆர் காயாவின் கொழு மலர்த் திருநிறத்த  
எந்தாய், யான் உன்னை எங்கு வந்து அணுகிற்பனே?

vantāy pōlē vantum eṉ maṉattiṉai nī,  
cintāmal ceyyāy ituvē itu ākil,  
kontu ār kāyāviṉ koḻu malart tiruniṟatta  
entāy, yāṉ uṉṉai eṅku vantu aṇukiṟpaṉē?

**English translation of verse 3.2.5:**

My Lord, like unto the bunchy flower red is your complexion grand,  
Should you persist in denying me your helping hand  
And fail to restrain my wandering mind,  
How can I, on my own, attain you indeed?  
Pray do appear before me, as you did  
(For the sake of [Gajendra](/definition/gajendra#vaishnavism "show Gajendra definitions") and [Prahlāda](/definition/prahlada#vaishnavism "show Prahlāda definitions")).

**Note**

In the preceding song, the [Āḻvār](/definition/aḻvar#vaishnavism "show Āḻvār definitions") requested the Lord to incarnate once more for his sake. The Lord tells the Āḻvār that, as [Śrī Rāma](/definition/shrirama#history "show Śrī Rāma definitions"), He was in this abode for eleven thousand years and, as Śrī [Kṛṣṇa](/definition/krishna#vaishnavism "show Kṛṣṇa definitions"), He stayed here for one hundred years. It would be pretty difficult for Him to incarnate again. The Āḻvār, however, pleads that the Lord should incarnate for his sake, at least for a few days, and if it wasn’t possible, He could at least put in His appearance, as He did for Gajendra and Prahlāda. The Āḻvār cannot brook separation from the Lord because he cannot refrain from [enjoying](/definition/enjoying#history "show enjoying definitions") His exquisite beauty. And by himself, he canrot reach Him and hence the request, as above.
