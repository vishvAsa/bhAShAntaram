**Tamil text and transliteration:**

சிந்தை மற்றொன்றின் திறத்தது அல்லாத்தன்மை தேவபிரான் அறியும்,  
சிந்தையினால் செய்வ தான் அறியாதன மாயங்கள் ஒன்றும் இல்லை,  
சிந்தையினால் சொல்லினால் செய்கையால் நிலத்தேவர் குழுவணங்கும்,  
சிந்தை மகிழ் திருவாறன்விளை உறை தீர்த்தனுக்கு அற்ற பின்னே.

cintai maṟṟoṉṟiṉ tiṟattatu allāttaṉmai tēvapirāṉ aṟiyum,  
cintaiyiṉāl ceyva tāṉ aṟiyātaṉa māyaṅkaḷ oṉṟum illai,  
cintaiyiṉāl colliṉāl ceykaiyāl nilattēvar kuḻuvaṇaṅkum,  
cintai makiḻ tiruvāṟaṉviḷai uṟai tīrttaṉukku aṟṟa piṉṉē.

**English translation of verse 7.10.10:**

There’s hardly a thought that crosses one’s mind,  
The omniscient Lord cannot comprehend;  
Surely, He knows that I think not of aught  
But the Lord immaculate. Who remains enshrined  
In Tiruvāṟaṉviḷai, that exilaṛates one’s heart.  
Worshipped by the devout thro’ word, deed and thought.

**Notes:**

This song provides the reply to the question supposed to have been put to him as to what he would do in case the Lord forced him into Heaven, which he had been demanding from Him quite often before. The Lord, being all-knowing, He is well aware that the Āḻvār’s mind now stands rivetted to Tiruvāṟaṉviḷai which has taken precedence over everything else, including the Heaven. Further, He is known to grant the boon prayed for by the subject, (Purusārta). That being the case, there is absolutely no risk of the Lord granting him anything other than that desired by him, even Heaven falling in the excluded category in this particular context. It is noteworthy that the Āḻvār does not even mouth the word. ‘Heaven’ and says, in general terms, that he does not think of anything else but the holy centre of Tiruvāṟaṉviḷai.
