**Tamil text and transliteration:**

அழைக்கின்ற அடிநாயேன் நாய்கூழை வாலால்  
குழைக்கின்றது போல என்உள்ளம் குழையும்  
மழைக்கு அன்றுகுன்றம் எடுத்து ஆநிரைகாத்தாய்.  
பிழைக்கின்றதுஅருள்என்று பேதுறுவனே

aḻaikkiṉṟa aṭināyēṉ nāykūḻai vālāl  
kuḻaikkiṉṟatu pōla eṉuḷḷam kuḻaiyum  
maḻaikku aṉṟukuṉṟam eṭuttu āniraikāttāy.  
piḻaikkiṉṟatuaruḷeṉṟu pētuṟuvaṉē

**English translation of verse 9.4.3:**

The mind of this base fellow, lying low and calling You out.  
Whirls like unto the dog eagerly twisting its tail short;  
You held once, oh Lord. Mount (Govardhan) aloft  
And spared the cattle, the fury of the rains;  
Me Your grace evades and this my mind does pain.

**Notes:**

\(i\) The Āḻvār feels agitated why the Lord, who sheds His grace on all yearning votaries, should withhold it from him alone, in spite of his inordinate longing for incessant communion with Him.

\(ii\) The Āḻvār submits that he is fully aware of his humble stature and yet, devoured by inordinate God-love, he keeps calling Him, like unto a dog trying hard to express its feelings to its master by twisting its tail. Pity unto the dog, with a short tail, which cannot function in this regard as effectively as a tail of better length! The Āḻvār feels that he too is in the same predicament as the dog with a dwarf tail, unable to express adequately his pangs of separation from the Lord. To a question, supposed to have been put to him by the Lord, as to why he aspires for Him without the requisite means and equipment, the Āḻvār rejoins that He has to shed on him His redemptive grace, in the same way as He shielded the cattle and shepherds from the terrific rains, unleashed by Indra, by holding aloft Mount Govardhan.
