**Tamil text and transliteration:**

மணியை வானவர் கண்ணனை தன்னது ஓர்-  
அணியை, தென் குருகூர்ச் சடகோபன், சொல்  
பணிசெய் ஆயிரத்துள் இவை பத்துடன்,  
தணிவிலர் கற்பரேல், கல்வி வாயுமே.

maṇiyai vāṉavar kaṇṇaṉai taṉṉatu ōr-  
aṇiyai, teṉ kurukūrc caṭakōpaṉ, col  
paṇicey āyirattuḷ ivai pattuṭaṉ,  
taṇivilar kaṟparēl, kalvi vāyumē.

**English translation of verse 1.10.11:**

Those that learn with zeal and thirst insatiable these songs ten,  
Out of the thousand sung by Tenkurukūr Caṭakōpaṉ,  
As a matter of service unto the Lord of sapphire hue,  
Himself a jewel unique, overlord of the Celestials,  
Will with knowledge divine be filled.

**Notes**

\(i\) In accordance with the text of the song, those that learn these ten songs will have their fill of knowledge. The ultimate aim of knowledge is Divine Service and so, this knowledge should blossom into service.

\(ii\) The blue-gem is likened to the Lord in a number of ways. In it, there is a happy blending, as in the case of the supreme Lord, of ‘Paratva’ and ‘Saulabhya’, the two extremes of paramountcy and simplicity. With all its high intrinsic value, the gem can be easily carried, tied at one end of the garment”.

\(iii\) It is common knowledge that jewels beautify the wearer. In the case of the Lord, however. He beautifies the jewels worn by Him and He is Himself the most attractive of all jewels.
