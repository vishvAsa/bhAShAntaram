**Tamil text and transliteration:**

ஆளியைக் காண்பரியாய் அரிகாண் நரியாய், அரக்கர்  
ஊளைஇட்டு அன்று இலங்கைகடந்து பிலம்புக்குஒளிப்ப,  
மீளியம் புள்ளைக்கடாய் விறல் மாலியைக் கொன்று, பின்னும்  
ஆள்உயர் குன்றங்கள் செய்து அடர்த்தானையும் காண்டும்கொலோ?

āḷiyaik kāṇpariyāy arikāṇ nariyāy, arakkar  
ūḷaiiṭṭu aṉṟu ilaṅkaikaṭantu pilampukkuoḷippa,  
mīḷiyam puḷḷaikkaṭāy viṟal māliyaik koṉṟu, piṉṉum  
āḷuyar kuṉṟaṅkaḷ ceytu aṭarttāṉaiyum kāṇṭumkolō?

**English translation of verse 7.6.8:**

When shall I behold my Lord Who did mount the lovely bird (Garuḍa)  
And annihilate the Asuras who from Laṅkā fled and hid  
Inside the underworld, like the horse by the Dinosaur scared.  
And the fox by the lion, slew the formidable Māli and his hordes  
Throwing up the corpses into heaps of mountains tall?

**Notes:**

The incidents, set out in chapters 5 to 8 of Rāmāyaṇa, Uttara Kāṇḍa, are alluded to in this song:

Mālyavān, Māli and Sumāli, the three sons of Śukeśa, a Rākṣasa, acquired enormous strength through terrific penance, settled in Laṅka and raised a huge population giving endless trouble to the Devas. The Devas, who sought the help of Lord Śrīman Nārāyaṇa, were vouchsafed by Him, protection. This enraged the Asuras who invaded the upper worlds, surrounded the Lord who appeared there, mounted on Garuḍa and engaged Him in a pitched battle. When Mali was slain by the Lord, his brothers Mālyavān and Sumāli encountered Him and were also beaten off. The two Asura chiefs then retreated, along with the remaining followers, into the Pāthāla (underworld) and hid themselves there. Sumāli’s daughter, named, Kaikaśi gave birth to Rāvaṇa and others.

The Āḻvār would want to know when he can enjoy the supreme bliss of beholding the Lord who can undoubtedly cut out all his foes (impediments) even as He destroyed these formidable demons. In the first two songs of this decad, the Lord has been set out as the goal, the next five songs reveal that He is also the ‘Means’ for attaining Him while in this and the next two songs, He is shown as the great Redeemer, vanquishing the forces of evil and thus cutting out all our sins.
