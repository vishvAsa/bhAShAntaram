Just when the Nāyakī was attempting to go to Tiruppēreyil where the Lord had gone for game-[hunting](/definition/hunting#history "show hunting definitions"), He returned victorious, like [Śrī Rāma](/definition/shrirama#history "show Śrī Rāma definitions") back home from exile, after vanquishing [Rāvaṇa](/definition/ravana#vaishnavism "show Rāvaṇa definitions") and his formidable horde of [Rākṣasas](/definition/rakshasa#vaishnavism "show Rākṣasas definitions"). It may be recalled that [Sītā](/definition/sita#vaishnavism "show Sītā definitions") locked Śrī [Rāma](/definition/rama#vaishnavism "show Rāma definitions") in her sweet embrace by way of nursing wounds on His person after His remarkable victory over [Kara](/definition/kara#history "show Kara definitions"), Dhūṣaṇa, Triśiras and the fourteen thousand Rākṣasas under them, singlehanded and in an amazingly short space of time. Even so, Parāṅkuśa Nāyakī, exceedingly jubilant over the Lord’s quick return from His victorious hunting expedition, gets locked up in His sweet embrace, by way of relieving His fatigue. In her festive mood, she also goes on recounting the Lord’s wondrous deeds and benefaction, vast and varied, as set out in this decad, exclaiming, “What a marvel!” “what a wonder!” and so on.
