**Tamil text and transliteration:**

நான்றிலஏழ் மண்ணும் தானத்தவே, பின்னும்  
நான்றில ஏழ் மலை தானத்தவே, பின்னும்  
நான்றில ஏழ் கடல் தானத்தவே, அப்பன்  
ஊன்றி இடந்து எயிற்றில் கொண்ட நாளே.

nāṉṟilaēḻ maṇṇum tāṉattavē, piṉṉum  
nāṉṟila ēḻ malai tāṉattavē, piṉṉum  
nāṉṟila ēḻ kaṭal tāṉattavē, appaṉ  
ūṉṟi iṭantu eyiṟṟil koṇṭa nāḷē.

**English translation of verse 7.4.3:**

Oh, what a wonder! when the Lord pulled the Earth out  
With His tooth unique from under the waters deep,  
The islands seven didn’t from erstwhile positions slip,  
The mountains seven were as they had been and didn’t tilt,  
And again, the oceans seven didn’t burst and were *in tact*.

**Notes:**

The Lord incarnated as the Great Boar, slew the demon Hiraṇyākṣa (the golden-eyed) in a pitched battle, and forked the Earth, hidden by him under the waters, with His unique tooth, long and portruding. When the Lord put the Earth back in position, all its contents, namely, the seven islands, the seven mountains and seven oceans were quite *in tact*, without undergoing any change whatever. This is indeed characteristic of the Omnipotent Lord. The inhabitants also continued to jog on as before, running after food and raiment, unmindful of the herculean tasks performed by the Lord. This is yet another wonder indeed!
