**Tamil text and transliteration:**

நெஞ்சமே நல்லை நல்லை உன்னைப் பெற்றால்-  
என் செய்யோம்? இனி என்ன குறைவினம்?  
மைந்தனை மலராள் மணவாளனைத்,  
துஞ்சும்போதும் விடாது தொடர்கண்டாய்.

neñcamē nallai nallai uṉṉaip peṟṟāl-  
eṉ ceyyōm? iṉi eṉṉa kuṟaiviṉam?  
maintaṉai malarāḷ maṇavāḷaṉait,  
tuñcumpōtum viṭātu toṭarkaṇṭāy.

**English translation of verse 1.10.4:**

Well done, my mind! what is there  
We can’t secure when you are here?  
Well, is there anything we would want anymore?  
Malarāḷ’s (Lotus-born Lakṣmī’s) Consort, ever young,  
Leave not, even if you find me straying.

**Note**

The Āḻvār’s mind exhorted by him in the preceding stanza to worship the Lord, responded so well that he now pats it on its back and prays that it shall cling to the Lord under all circumstances. The Āḻvār apprehends the off-chance of his shrinking back from the Lord once again, when his own humility haunts him, in dire contrast to the Lord’s overwhelming superiority. Right now, the Āḻvār counsels his mind, never to get parted from the Lord, whatever might be his own vicissitudes,
