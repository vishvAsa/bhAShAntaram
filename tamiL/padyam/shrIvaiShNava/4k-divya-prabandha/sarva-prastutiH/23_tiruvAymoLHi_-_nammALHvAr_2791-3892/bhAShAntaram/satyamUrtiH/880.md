**Tamil text and transliteration:**

கள் அவிழ் தாமரைக்கண் கண்ணனே! எனக்கு ஒன்று அருளாய்,  
உள்ளதும் இல்லதும் ஆய் உலப்பு இல்லன ஆய் வியவு ஆய்,  
வெள்ளத் தடம் கடலுள் விட நாகு அணைமேல் மருவி,  
உள்ளப் பல் யோகு செய்தி இவை என்ன உபாயங்களே!

kaḷ aviḻ tāmaraikkaṇ kaṇṇaṉē! eṉakku oṉṟu aruḷāy,  
uḷḷatum illatum āy ulappu illaṉa āy viyavu āy,  
veḷḷat taṭam kaṭaluḷ viṭa nāku aṇaimēl maruvi,  
uḷḷap pal yōku ceyti ivai eṉṉa upāyaṅkaḷē!

**English translation of verse 7.8.4:**

Oh, Kaṇṇā, the lotus-eyed, pray clarify a thing unto me not clear,  
The Master Supreme of all things and beings that You are—  
The non-changing Individuals in many an assorted grade  
And the ever-changing things, vast and varied; in the Milk-ocean broad;  
You keep pondering, reposing on Your pcisonous-serpent bed;  
What are the plans up Your sleeves indeed?

**Notes:**

\(i\) The Āḻvār seems to question the Lord whether even He has to indulge in this kind of contemplation, despite His omni- science and omnipotence and seeks clarification from Him as to what precisely He means to hit upon, as a result of such deep thinking in a state of Yoga-nidhrā (the highest form of activity).

\(ii\) The sentient beings (the Jīvas) do not change at all, only the material outer cloak, the body changes; on the other hand, the non-sentient things are ephemeral, in the sense that they undergo frequent changes of state. The Lord is the great ordainer of both the species. Innumerable indeed are the Jivas, each one with its own propensities, accumulated wisdom and load of ‘Karma’ (deeds good and bad), unless the Jiva is God-bent, the Lord cannot possibly pull it up and naturally He keeps pondering over the ways and means of resuscitation of the Jivas.
