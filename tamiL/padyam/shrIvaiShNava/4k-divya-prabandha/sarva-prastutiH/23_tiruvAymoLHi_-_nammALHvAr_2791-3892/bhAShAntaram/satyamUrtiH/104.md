**Tamil text and transliteration:**

ஆனான் ஆன் ஆயன், மீனோடேனமும்;  
தான் ஆனான் என்னில், தானாயசங்கே.

āṉāṉ āṉ āyaṉ, mīṉōṭēṉamum;  
tāṉ āṉāṉ eṉṉil, tāṉāyacaṅkē.

**English translation of verse 1.8.8:**

Myriads are the Lord’s incarnations;  
As the Cowherd He came down,  
Fish, Boar and many other forms  
He took, just to get hold of me.

**Note**

The Āḻvār feels that the innumerable Avatāras of the Lord were all for his delectation, mainly directed towards getting hold of him and uniting with him.
