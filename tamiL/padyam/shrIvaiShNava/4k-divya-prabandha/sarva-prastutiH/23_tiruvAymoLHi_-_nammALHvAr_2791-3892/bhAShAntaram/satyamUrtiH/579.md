**[Tamil](/definition/tamil#history "show Tamil definitions") text and transliteration:**

மேலும் வன்பழி நம்குடிக்கு இவள் என்று அன்னை காணக்கொடாள்  
சோலைசூழ் தண்திருக்குறுங்குடி நம்பியை நான் கண்டபின்  
கோலநீள் கொடி மூக்கும் தாமரைக் கண்ணும் கனிவாயும்  
நீலமேனியும் நான்கு தோளும் என் நெஞ்சம் நிறைந்தனவே.

mēlum vaṉpaḻi namkuṭikku ivaḷ eṉṟu aṉṉai kāṇakkoṭāḷ  
cōlaicūḻ taṇtirukkuṟuṅkuṭi nampiyai nāṉ kaṇṭapiṉ  
kōlanīḷ [koṭi](/definition/koti#history "show koṭi definitions") mūkkum tāmaraik kaṇṇum kaṉivāyum  
nīlamēṉiyum nāṉku tōḷum eṉ neñcam niṟaintaṉavē.

**English translation of verse 5.5.6:**

Mother [fears](/definition/fear#history "show fears definitions") this girl will bring a bad name  
Unto her sacred clan for all time to come.  
And the Lord at Tirukkuṟuṅkuṭi, she wouldn’t allow me to behold,  
But Him I have beheld, His nose, long and lovely, lips red,  
Lotus eyes, blue tint and shoulders four have my mind [filled](/definition/filling#history "show filled definitions").

#### Note

The Mother is apprehensive that the Nāyakī is transgressing her bounds as a ‘prapanna’ who has to await the descent of the Lord’s grace, and decides not to allow the Nāyakī to see [Nampi](/definition/nampi#history "show Nampi definitions"), (The perfect Lord) at Tirukkuṟuṅkuṭi. But then, this is like erecting a bund after all the water in the basin has flown down the stream. The truth of the matter is that the Nāyakī has already seen Nampi and right from the moment she beheld Him, all the features of the Lord, as set out in this song, stand indelibly imprinted in her mind. The restrictions now imposed by the Mother have, therefore, no meaning. What would have been exceptionable in the earlier stages becomes praiseworthy in such an advanced state of uncontrollable yearning for quick consummation of God-love. It is a pity the elders could not appreciate this.
