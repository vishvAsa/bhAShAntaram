**Tamil text and transliteration:**

காண்மின்கள் அன்னையர்காள்! என்று காட்டும் வகைஅறியேன்,  
நாள்மன்னு வெண்திங்கள் கொல்! நயந்தார்கட்கு நச்சுஇலைகொல்,  
சேண்மன்னு நால்தடம்தோள் பெருமான்தன் திருநுதலே?,  
கோள்மன்னி ஆவிஅடும் கொடியேன் உயிர் கோள்இழைத்தே

kāṇmiṉkaḷ aṉṉaiyarkāḷ! eṉṟu kāṭṭum vakaiaṟiyēṉ,  
nāḷmaṉṉu veṇtiṅkaḷ kol! nayantārkaṭku naccuilaikol,  
cēṇmaṉṉu nāltaṭamtōḷ perumāṉtaṉ tirunutalē?,  
kōḷmaṉṉi āviaṭum koṭiyēṉ uyir kōḷiḻaittē

**English translation of verse 7.7.7:**

Whether ‘tis the waxing moon in the mid-fortnight  
Or the herb deadly unto God-lovers, say I can’t.  
Oh, Elders, how I wish I could show you what I behold!  
But I know not how it can be done, well, ‘tis the forehead  
Of the Lord with shoulders four, stout and fine  
That blisters this sinner’s soul, out to snatch my life.

**Notes:**

\(i\) The Lord’s charming forehead is now visualised by the Nāyakī. She wants to show it to the elders around but she can’t do so, it being only a mental vision confined to her. Nor can she ask them to see it because they are not similarly gifted with this vision. The Lord’s sinewy shoulders have also been mentioned in this song to identity the forehead as that of the One whose shoulders, stout and fine, enthralled the Āḻvār even as they attracted Hanumān, at first sight.

\(ii\) The Lord is indeed a delicious herb, as acknowledged by the Āḻvār himself in V-7, but He turns out to be deadly like poison, in the Nāyakī’s present state of dejection.

\(iii\) If the Lord’s charming features should turn out to be oppressive, it is because of the Āḻvār’s sins, as he put it.
