**[Tamil](/definition/tamil#history "show Tamil definitions") text and transliteration:**

கூடச்சென்றேன் இனி என்கொடுக்கேன்? கோல்வளை நெஞ்சத் தொடக்கம் எல்லாம்  
பாடுஅற்றுஒழிய இழந்துவைகல் பல்வளையார்முன் பரிசுஅழிந்தேன்  
மாடக்கொடிமதிள் தென்குளந்தை வண்குடபால் நின்ற மாயக்கூத்தன்  
ஆடல்பறவை உயர்த்தவெல்போர் ஆழிவலவனை ஆதரித்தே.

kūṭacceṉṟēṉ iṉi eṉkoṭukkēṉ? kōlvaḷai neñcat toṭakkam ellām  
pāṭuaṟṟuoḻiya iḻantuvaikal palvaḷaiyārmuṉ paricuaḻintēṉ  
māṭakkoṭimatiḷ teṉkuḷantai vaṇkuṭapāl niṉṟa māyakkūttaṉ  
āṭalpaṟavai uyarttavelpōr āḻivalavaṉai ātarittē.

**English translation of verse 8.2.4:**

Court did I Lord Māyakkūttaṉ, borne aloft by the gay [bird](/definition/bird#history "show bird definitions"),  
Enshrined in the western part of Teṉkuḻantai with castles tall  
And stately [walls](/definition/wall#history "show walls definitions"), Who the victorious disc does wield,  
And lost my bangles lovely, my mind, one and all;  
Indeed I have nothing more to lose, having lost, long back,  
My feminine bearing, in the eyes of the women wearing bangles, in bulk.

**Notes:**

\(i\) This song brings out the [Āḻvār](/definition/aḻvar#vaishnavism "show Āḻvār definitions")’s adoration of Māyakkūtṭaṉ, the Deity enshrined in Tenkuḷantai, popularly known as Peruṅkuḻam, near [Āḻvār Tirunakari](/definition/alvar-tirunakari#vaishnavism "show Āḻvār Tirunakari definitions") ([Kurukūr](/definition/kurukur#vaishnavism "show Kurukūr definitions")), the birthplace of the Saint.

\(ii\) *Māyakkūttaṉ*: This could either refer to Lord [Kṛṣṇa](/definition/krishna#vaishnavism "show Kṛṣṇa definitions")’s vast array of wondrous deeds, performed during the brief span of His advent over here, right in the middle of the rituals performed by the Celestials in the yonder [Heaven](/definition/heaven#history "show Heaven definitions"), as part of their diurnal worship of the Lord in His transcendent Form.

or

Generally, the Lord who binds us to this body, like unto a bird’s nest and watches all the fun and frolic that follow.

\(iii\) [Garuḍa](/definition/garuda#vaishnavism "show Garuḍa definitions") flutters its wings with hilarious joy, in contemplation of the prospective outing of the Lord mounted on him.

\(iv\) When the mates chide the Nāyakī that, by her daring she stood to lose all her possessions, one by one, she replies that there is nothing more to lose, having already lost her all.
