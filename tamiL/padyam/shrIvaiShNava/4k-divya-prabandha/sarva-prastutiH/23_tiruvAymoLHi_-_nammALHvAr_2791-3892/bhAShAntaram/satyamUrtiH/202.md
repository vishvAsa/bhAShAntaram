As set out, in the last decad, the Āḻvār is experiencing the Supreme bliss of Union with the Lord, like Heaven transplanted right here. And what about the Lord? In the supreme joy of His union with the Āḻvār, the Lord, is exploring new avenues of regaling him as well as those associated with him. What a fine reciprocity?

In II-3, the Āḻvār pined, for the company of the Lord’s devotees and now the Lord’s love for the Āḻvār extends to his devotees as well. But at the same time. He also apprehends the possibility of the Āḻvār slipping back to his old ways and shrinking away from Him, overwhelmed by His transcendent glory. The Āḻvār feels the Lord’s pulse all right and hastens to assure Him that he would not give up his Lord on any account and that his present grip on Him is very tight indeed.

Śrī Nampiḷḷai likens the Lord’s apprehension, referred to above, to Śrī Rāma’s apprehension whether the extremely happy days, he and Śīta  had in Citrakūṭ [Citrakūṭa] in each other’s delightful company, would at all go on for all time, being too good to last long.
