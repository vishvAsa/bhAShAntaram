தொல்லையஞ்சோதி நினைக்குங்கால் என் சொல்அளவன்று இமையோர் தமக்கும்  
எல்லைஇலாதன கூழ்ப்புச்செய்யும் அத்திறம் நிற்க எம்மாமைகொண்டான்  
அல்லிமலர்த் தண்துழாயும் தாரான் ஆர்க்கு இடுகோ இனிப்பூசல்? சொல்லீர்  
வல்லிவளவயல்சூழ் குடந்தை மாமலர்க்கண் வளர்கின்றமாலே.

**English translation of verse 8.2.6:**

Tell me, my mates, to whom else I shall my woes depose,  
When the resplendent Lord of prowess extra-ordinary, much beyond the grasp  
Of even Celestials, the Great one of amazing grandeur, Who does repose  
In Tirukkuṭantai amid nice gardens and [fields](/definition/field#history "show fields definitions") fertile, who did grab  
My complexion fair but wouldn’t favour me with tuḷaci garland, full of fragrance.

**Notes:**

\(i\) The mates would appear to have been prodding the Nāyakī, saying that the Lord is indeed dear to attain and not the easily accessible one, as she was making out. The Nāyakī, however, effectively silences them by pointing out that it matters not whether He is near or far, seeing that He has kept her mind solely fixed on Him. And, in this state of mind, the Nāyakī sees no other way but to be a supplicant at His door-step, instead of [hanging](/definition/hanging#history "show hanging definitions") on to those with whom she has nothing to do. As a matter of fact, it would not be possible even to the exalted Celestials like [Brahmā](/definition/brahma#vaishnavism "show Brahmā definitions") and [Rudra](/definition/rudra#vaishnavism "show Rudra definitions") to define the Lord’s stance with any degree of certainty. He, who is beyond reach some times, is the most easily attainable at other times, and the [doubt](/definition/doubt#history "show doubt definitions"), therefore, assails the minds of one and all, high and low, as to what the Lord would be like, at any one time. In the ‘[Mokṣa](/definition/moksha#vaishnavism "show Mokṣa definitions") [Dharma](/definition/dharma#vaishnavism "show Dharma definitions")’ of [Mahābhārata](/definition/mahabharata#vaishnavism "show Mahābhārata definitions"), Brahmā said unto Rudra, that none, including them, could fathom the infinite Mind of the Lord and plumb its mysterious depths.

\(ii\) Such a Great one condescended to reveal His exquisite Form unto the Nāyakī and steal away her heart, as evidenced by the discoloration that has set in. During those moments of His union with the Nayaki, He was totally subservient to her but now that He keeps aloof of her, He would not care to give her even the tuḷaci garland worn on His person, which could, to some extent, alleviate her [suffering](/definition/suffering#history "show suffering definitions"). Even so, it behoves her to wait at His door-step only, whatever be His dispensation, good, bad or indifferent, because of the inalienable link between the two.
