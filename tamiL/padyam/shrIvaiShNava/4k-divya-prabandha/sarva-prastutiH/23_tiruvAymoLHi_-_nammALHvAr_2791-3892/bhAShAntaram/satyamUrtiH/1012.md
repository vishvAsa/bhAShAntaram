**Tamil text and transliteration:**

யானும் தானாய் ஒழிந்தானை யாதும் எவர்க்கும் முன்னோனை  
தானும் சிவனும் பிரமனும்ஆகிப் பணைத்த தனிமுதலை  
தேனும் பாலும் கன்னலும் அமுதும்ஆகித் தித்தித்து என்  
ஊனில் உயிரில் உணர்வினில் நின்ற ஒன்றை உணர்ந்தேனே

yāṉum tāṉāy oḻintāṉai yātum evarkkum muṉṉōṉai  
tāṉum civaṉum piramaṉumākip paṇaitta taṉimutalai  
tēṉum pālum kaṉṉalum amutumākit tittittu eṉ  
ūṉil uyiril uṇarviṉil niṉṟa oṉṟai uṇarntēṉē

**English translation of verse 8.8.4:**

Realised have the one unto whom I stand indissolubly bound;  
My soul, which does thro’ my body, spirit and intellect extend,  
Is His body, delectable unto Him like honey, milk, candy and nectar,  
To things and beings, one and all, He is anterior,  
The Primate unique, who did the Trinity compose and stand  
Alongside Civaṉ and Piramaṉ, whose functions He ordained.

**Notes:**

The Lord has now made the Āḻvār aware of the fact that his soul is indeed extremely delectable to Him. No doubt, all things and beings, with different forms and names, were ushered in by Him alone, and yet, in the process, He pursued different modes of operation. The ungodly and those not bent towards Him were created solely in the light of their past actions; Brahmā, Rudra and other Devas, hankering after wealth and power, were assigned positions where they could wield such power and command wealth; in the case of the Āḻvār, however, He demonstrated unto him the fact of his soul being exclusively His, highly enjoyed by Him, thereby making him realise that he is not apart from Him, being but His body, an attribute to Him, as whiteness is to a white wall or white cloth. Prior to the dawn of this knowledge, the individual relished the soul as his own and now he relishes the soul as the Lord’s, even as the Lord lavishes his affections on it as His attribute.
