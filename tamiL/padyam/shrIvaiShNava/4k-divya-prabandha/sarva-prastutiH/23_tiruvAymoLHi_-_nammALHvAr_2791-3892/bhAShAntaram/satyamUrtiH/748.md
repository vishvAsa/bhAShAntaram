**Tamil text and transliteration:**

தூமதுவாய்கள் கொண்டுவந்து என் முல்லைகள்மேல் தும்பிகாள்,  
பூ மது உண்ணச் செல்லில் வினையேனைப் பொய்செய்து அகன்ற,  
மாமதுவார் தண்துழாய்முடி வானவர் கோனைக் கண்டு,  
யாம் இதுவோ தக்கவாறு என்னவேண்டும் கண்டீர் நுங்கட்கே.

tūmatuvāykaḷ koṇṭuvantu eṉ mullaikaḷmēl tumpikāḷ,  
pū matu uṇṇac cellil viṉaiyēṉaip poyceytu akaṉṟa,  
māmatuvār taṇtuḻāymuṭi vāṉavar kōṉaik kaṇṭu,  
yām ituvō takkavāṟu eṉṉavēṇṭum kaṇṭīr nuṅkaṭkē.

**English translation of verse 6.8.4:**

Ye, beetles sweet lurking in Jasmine flowers by me reared,  
When next in search of honey you go, meet the Lord  
Of the Celestials in Heaven, sporting cool tuḷaci garland  
On His crown, Who with this sinner freely mingled,  
As in a dream and left, and say ‘tis hardly meet  
That He should unto sovereignty stick and from me depart.

#### Notes

\(i\) The beetles, ever in quest of honey, are directed by the Nāyakī to the Lord in Heaven, on whose crown is honey-studded tuḷaci, garland, so as to gather the honey therefrom and incidentally tell the Lord that He should not keep aloof from her, at that distance, gloating over His transcendent glory. It is through such mediation by the God’s chosen few, His detachment from us is changed into attachment.

\(ii\) The creatures were languishing without honey, as the flowers on the Nāyakī’s locks as well as the surrounding gardens had all dried up, due to her separation from the Lord. And so, the Nāyakī directs them to the Lord in Heaven, sporting tuḷaci garlands, studded with honey.

\(iii\) Lest the Nāyakī should collapse, if ever she got scent of her impending separation from the Lord, He was telling her, during their erstwhile rapport, that He would never part from her. The Nāyakī takes the blame on herself that it is her sin that made even the truthful Lord utter lies, in this manner, during their erstwhile rapport.
