**Tamil text and transliteration:**

தோள் இணை மேலும் நன் மார்பின் மேலும் சுடர் முடி மேலும்,  
தாள் இணை மேலும் புனைந்த தண் அம் துழாய் உடை அம்மான்  
கேள் இணை ஒன்றும் இலாதான் கிளரும் சுடர் ஒளி மூர்த்தி,  
நாள் அணைந்து ஒன்றும் அகலான் என்னுடை நாவின் உளானே.

tōḷ iṇai mēlum naṉ mārpiṉ mēlum cuṭar muṭi mēlum,  
tāḷ iṇai mēlum puṉainta taṇ am tuḻāy uṭai ammāṉ  
kēḷ iṇai oṉṟum ilātāṉ kiḷarum cuṭar oḷi mūrtti,  
nāḷ aṇaintu oṉṟum akalāṉ eṉṉuṭai nāviṉ uḷāṉē.

**English translation of verse 1.9.7:**

With His shoulders, winsome chest, the lustrous crown  
And feet, by tulacī, cool and nice, gaily adorned,  
The peerless Lord of mounting radiance and glowing renown,  
Tightens His hold on me, day by day, and now rests He in my tongue.

**Notes**

\(i\) Even as the wife bedecks and beautifies herself to excite the special fascination of her husband, the Lord bedecks Himself with tulacī, which holds out special fascination for the Āḻvār and mingles with him.

\(ii\) The sequence of decoration indicated in the stanza is appreciated by Śrī Parāśara Bhaṭṭar in his own inimitable way, as follows:

> It is but meet, the great Warrior that the Lord is, He decorates first > of all His sinewy shoulders bearing His > weapons, > namely, Conch and Discus; next comes the winsome chest, the > seat of the Divine > Mother, needing decoration for Her exhilaration; the crown comes > thereafter only and the rest goes to the Lord’s feet, always coveted > by the devotees, where their > salvation > lies.

\(iii\) *Peerless Lord*: That the Lord is of incomparable excellence is brought out succinctly, later on, in III-1-2, the comparisons with lotus, gold etc., touching only a fringe of the subject. The things with which the Lord is compared actually suffer in comparison and lag far behind Him, rather pale into insignificance.
