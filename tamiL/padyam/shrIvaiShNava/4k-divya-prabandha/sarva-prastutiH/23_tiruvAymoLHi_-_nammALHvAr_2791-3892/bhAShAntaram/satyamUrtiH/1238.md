**[Tamil](/definition/tamil#history "show Tamil definitions") text and transliteration:**

ஆள்வான் ஆழிநீர்க் கோள்வாய் அரவுஅணையான்  
தாள்வாய் மலர்இட்டு நாள்வாய் நாடீரே.

āḷvāṉ āḻinīrk kōḷvāy aravuaṇaiyāṉ  
tāḷvāy malariṭṭu nāḷvāy nāṭīrē.

**English translation of verse 10.5.4:**

Reclining on the [serpent](/definition/serpent#history "show serpent definitions"), strong and smart,  
The Lord holds sway over the Universe vast;  
Him may You adore, all the time,  
Placing at His lovely feet flowers fine.

**Notes:**

‘Āya’, the dative ending of the last word of Tirumantra, that is, ‘Nārāyaṇāya’ reveals the deep urge of the subject to render service unto the Lord in every conceivable manner, like that of ‘Ādiśesa’ (first [servant](/definition/servant#history "show servant definitions")), rather the factotum who serves the Lord in a number of ways, as umbrella, [throne](/definition/throne#history "show throne definitions"), footwear, bed etc., etc. Therefore it is, that the [Āḻvār](/definition/aḻvar#vaishnavism "show Āḻvār definitions") calls upon the worldlings to render service unto the Lord, in keeping with the above elucidation of the meaning of the word ‘Nārāyaṇāya’.

The Lord reclines on Ādiśesa, in the Milk ocean, the [seat](/definition/seat#history "show seat definitions") of His creative activity, well within the ear-shot of the appeal of ardent devotees, so as to fulfil His role, as the Universal Protector. He is also easily worshippable, with whatever flowers the votary can get hold of.
