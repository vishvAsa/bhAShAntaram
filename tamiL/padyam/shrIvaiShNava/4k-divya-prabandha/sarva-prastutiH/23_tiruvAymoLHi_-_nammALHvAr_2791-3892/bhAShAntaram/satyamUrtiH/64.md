**Tamil text and transliteration:**

அடியேன் சிறிய ஞானத்தன்; அறிதல் ஆர்க்கும் அரியானை  
கடி சேர் தண் அம் துழாய்க் கண்ணி புனைந்தான் தன்னை கண்ணனை  
செடி ஆர் ஆக்கை அடியாரைச் சேர்தல் தீர்க்கும் திருமாலை  
அடியேன் காண்பான் அலற்றுவன்; இதனின் மிக்கு ஓர் அயர்வு உண்டே?

aṭiyēṉ ciṟiya ñāṉattaṉ; aṟital ārkkum ariyāṉai  
kaṭi cēr taṇ am tuḻāyk kaṇṇi puṉaintāṉ taṉṉai kaṇṇaṉai  
ceṭi ār ākkai aṭiyāraic cērtal tīrkkum tirumālai  
aṭiyēṉ kāṇpāṉ alaṟṟuvaṉ; itaṉiṉ mikku ōr ayarvu uṇṭē?

**English translation of verse 1.5.7:**

This humble self of meagre intellect pines to meet  
Kaṇṇaṉ, sporting tulacī garland, cool and lovely, of fragrance sweet.  
Beyond the Comprehension of one and all (however great),  
‘Tirumāl’, who, unto those that seek Him, does cut out  
Their bondage dense; is there anything more indiscreet?

**Note**

The preceding song ended on a despondent note, showing the Āḻvār sinking down, due to the poignance of separation from the Lord. The merciful Lord would not run the risk of testing him anymore, and was about to oblige him with His presence. Sensing this, however, the Āḻvār was once more weighed down by inferiority complex, egging him on to retreat again. The Āḻvār has all along vociferously condemned those who are content with mere self-enjoyment (Kaivalya) after perennial disembodiment, that is, liberation from the cycle of birth and death, which is far inferior to the bliss of constant service unto the Lord in Heaven. In the present context, however, the Āḻvār is inclined to hold that even this would be wholesome, as compared to a state of embodiment such as his, with its potentiality for such blasphemous conduct as pining for the Lord’s presence and mixing with Him, thereby defiling His sacred person. This is indeed the limit for the Āḻvār’s humility (naicya).
