**[Tamil](/definition/tamil#history "show Tamil definitions") text and transliteration:**

அடைவதும்அணியார் மலர்மங்கைதோள்  
மிடைவதும் அசுரர்க்குவெம்போர்களே  
கடைவதும் கடலுள்அமுதம் என்மனம்  
உடைவதும் அவற்கேஒருங்காகவே.

**English translation of verse 9.3.6:**

Thaws down my mind fully, steeped in contemplation  
Of the Lord’s dalliance with His [bejewelled](/definition/bejewelled#history "show bejewelled definitions") spouse, lotus-born,  
His encounters fierce with Acurars and His churning the ocean  
To grant unto [Devas](/definition/deva#vaishnavism "show Devas definitions"), ambrosia, out of deep compassion.

**Notes:**

The [Āḻvār](/definition/aḻvar#vaishnavism "show Āḻvār definitions")’s mind having responded to his appeal exceedingly well, he now describes its ecstatic reactions, in the course of its contemplation of the Lord’s glorious deeds and auspicious traits. The Āḻvār’s mind thaws down, as it dwells on the Lord’s tender solicitude even for the selfish and self-centred Devas and the enormous [pains](/definition/pain#history "show pains definitions") He had taken to churn the ocean and secure for them the ambrosia, longed for by them. According to Nampiḷḷai, it looks as if the Lord churned the Milk-ocean, just to churn the minds of devotees of the Āḻvār’s calibre and intensify their God-love.
