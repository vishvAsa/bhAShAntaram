**Tamil text and transliteration:**

மானைநோக்கி மடப்பின்னைதன் கேள்வனை  
தேனைவாடாமலர்இட்டு நீர்இறைஞ்சுமின்  
வானைஉந்தும் மதிள்சூழ் திருக்கண்ணபுரம்  
தான்நயந்த பெருமான் சரண்ஆகுமே.

māṉainōkki maṭappiṉṉaitaṉ kēḷvaṉai  
tēṉaivāṭāmalariṭṭu nīriṟaiñcumiṉ  
vāṉaiuntum matiḷcūḻ tirukkaṇṇapuram  
tāṉnayanta perumāṉ caraṇākumē.

**English translation of verse 9.10.4:**

Worship our sire with choice flowers, in fresh bloom,  
The doe-eyed Piṉṉai’s Spouse, sweet as honey;  
The Lord that lovingly stays in Tirukkaṇṇapuram,  
Whose walls rise up to the sky, is indeed our haven.

**Notes:**

\(i\) The doe-eyed Consort of the Lord is the unfailing intercessor between man and God and the Āḻvār is, therefore, sure of the salvation of his addressee (the worldlings) whom he advises to approach the Lord through the good offices of the Divine Mother.

\(ii\) The Āḻvār has indeed to deal with a cross-section of humanity, with varying degrees of spiritual calibre and equipment. He would not, therefore, leave out of his purview those who have not, as yet, developed that robust faith in the Lord, which makes them look upon Him as the Ready Means (siddhopāya), the Means and the End, rolled into one. For the lesser grades of mankind, he preaches the form of worship involving the use of materials, such as flowers, fresh and fine, honey etc., the ‘Sāṅga Bhakti’, as it is called, vide aphorism 227 of ‘Ācārya Hṛdayam’.
