**Tamil text and transliteration:**

அவரவர் தமதமது அறிவு அறி வகைவகை  
அவரவர் இறையவர் என அடி அடைவர்கள்  
அவரவர் இறையவர் குறைவு இலர் இறையவர்  
அவரவர் விதிவழி அடைய நின்றனரே.

avaravar tamatamatu aṟivu aṟi vakaivakai  
avaravar iṟaiyavar eṉa aṭi aṭaivarkaḷ  
avaravar iṟaiyavar kuṟaivu ilar iṟaiyavar  
avaravar vitivaḻi aṭaiya niṉṟaṉarē.

**English translation of verse 1.1.5:**

Different grades of people, with varying degrees of spiritual knowledge and calibre, seek favours from minor deities (*Agni*, *Indra* etc.) whom they propitiate as their God. If those deities, in turn, bestow the boons sought by their votaries, to the extent deserved by them, it is *only through the grace of the Supreme Lord, (Śrīman Nārāyaṇa*) who stays inside these deities (as their internal *controller*) and maintains them.

**Notes**

\(i\) The śāstras proclaim that the Supreme Lord (puruṣōttama) alone is the granter of all felicities and destroyer of all evils.[^1]

\(ii\) But for the influx of the requisite power from the Supreme Lord, which maintains the minor deities in their respective positions of authority, the minor deities, by themselves, would be incapable of extending favours to their votaries and vouch-safing protection to them; if they did, all by themselves, it would indeed be just as miraculous as the earthen elephants and horses, stationed in battle array, in the precincts of the petty pagodas of demi-gods (*Śāsthā*), on the outskirts of villages and towns, actually going to battle—a veritable impossibility!

[^1]:  “na sampadam samāhare vibhatām vinivartane, samartho dhriśyate kaścit tam vinā puruottamaṃ.”
