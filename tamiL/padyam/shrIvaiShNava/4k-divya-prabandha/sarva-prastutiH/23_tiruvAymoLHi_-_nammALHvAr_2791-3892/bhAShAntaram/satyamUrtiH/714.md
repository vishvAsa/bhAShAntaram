இரங்கி நாள்தொறும் வாய்வெரீஇ இவள் கண்ண நீர்கள் அலமர,  
மரங்களும் இரங்கும் வகை 'மணிவண்ணவோ!' என்று கூவுமால்,  
துரங்கம் வாய் பிளந்தான் உறை தொலைவில்லிமங்கலம் என்று, தன்  
கரங்கள் கூப்பித் தொழும் அவ்ஊர்த் திருநாமம் கற்றதன் பின்னையே.

**English translation of verse 6.5.9:**

Ye, mothers, this young lady calls out, “oh, gem-hued Lord!”  
Day in and day out, with her mind deeply absorbed,  
And [tears](/definition/tear#history "show tears definitions") splashing down her eyes, moving [trees](/definition/tree#history "show trees definitions") besides;  
Ever since she learnt the name of that city, Tolaivillimaṅkalam, where resides  
The Lord who tore open the mouth of the demoniac [horse](/definition/horse#history "show horse definitions"),  
In that direction she turns and with joined palms adores.

#### Note

Having been initiated into this pilgrim centre, the Nāyakī keeps on reciting the Lord’s name, in such a manner that even the inanimate beings, like trees, are moved. If these hymns can move even the stony hearts of the uninitiated men of the present day, what [doubt](/definition/doubt#history "show doubt definitions") could there be about their impact on the contemporary men and things, when the songs flowed from the [Āḻvār](/definition/aḻvar#vaishnavism "show Āḻvār definitions")’s rapturous lips! When Lord [Kṛṣṇa](/definition/krishna#vaishnavism "show Kṛṣṇa definitions") played on the flute, [Periyāḻvār](/definition/periyalvar#vaishnavism "show Periyāḻvār definitions") would have it, that the trees shed honey in copious quantities, the flowers started [falling](/definition/falling#history "show falling definitions") down and the boughs bent down, in admiration. The voice of the yearning soul of the Āḻvār, with its mellifluity galore, would have doubtless made things around him react likewise. In fact, the mate says ‘that city in [line](/definition/line#history "show line definitions") 4 of the song, because she cannot reproduce the sweetness with which the Nāyakī spells out ‘Tiruttolaivillimaṅkalam.’
