**[Tamil](/definition/tamil#history "show Tamil definitions") text and transliteration:**

பாலன் ஆய் ஏழ் உலகு உண்டு பரிவு இன்றி,  
ஆல் இலை அன்னவசம் செய்யும் அண்ணலார்,  
தாள் இணைமேல் அணி தண் அம் துழாய் என்றே  
மாலுமால், வல்வினையேன் மட வல்லியே. (2)

pālaṉ āy ēḻ ulaku uṇṭu parivu iṉṟi,  
āl ilai aṉṉavacam ceyyum aṇṇalār,  
tāḷ iṇaimēl aṇi taṇ am tuḻāy eṉṟē  
mālumāl, valviṉaiyēṉ [maṭa](/definition/mata#history "show maṭa definitions") valliyē. (2)

**English translation of verse 4.2.1:**

Alas! this fell sinner’s tender daughter, like unto a creeper young  
Is madly in love with the Lord and keeps pining  
For the tuḷaci garland, cool and nice, on His feet worn,  
When He, as a babe, held in His stomach, the worlds seven,  
With no effort, reposing on a fig-leaf thin.

**Note**

“It is amazing”, the Mother exclaims, “that my daughter should [pine](/definition/pine#history "show pine definitions"), at this distance of time, for the tuḷaci garland worn on the Lord’s feet when He contained, in His stomach, all the worlds and reposed, as a tender babe, on a fig-leaf, floating on the vast expanse of water. Had the Lord gulped down the worlds as an adult, it might not agitate my daughter’s mind so much. She is indeed worried that He should have done it, as a mere babe, even as children are generally prone to gulp down the mouth whatever comes handy. And then, I can understand her mouth constantly [uttering](/definition/uttering#history "show uttering definitions") the words, tuḷaci, cool and lovely, at the feet of the Lord’ confounded that she is with deep love but she longs to have it, right now. If a person comprehends as fire the lustre shed by a gem, should the heat of this imaginary fire be also felt? How strange is my daughter’s stance indeed!”
