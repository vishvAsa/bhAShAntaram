The soul-stirring utterances of the Saint, as in the last decad, should indeed have gone straight to the Lord in [Heaven](/definition/heaven#history "show Heaven definitions"). In a way, the Lord would seem to have pacified the [Āḻvār](/definition/aḻvar#vaishnavism "show Āḻvār definitions") by enabling him to comprehend mentally His exquisite Form, limb by limb. Led away by the Lord’s charming beauty, the Āḻvār, aims at physical enjoyment of the Lord’s exquisite Form, with outstretched hands and feels frustrated when such an experience is denied to him. Thrown into deep dejection, the Āḻvār, once again (figuratively) transformed as the Nāyakī, hits back the mates and elders. She asserts that she could hardly yield to their threats and cajoling, overwhelmed as she was by the Lord’s bewitching Form, in all its details, on a par with physical perception through the senses.

This decad is similar to V-5 and yet, there is a difference between the two. There was an alternation of the Āḻvār’s rejoicing and regret, in the earlier decad, while, in the current one, the expression of stinging regret dominates, in so far as the Āḻvār could not envision the Lord’s Form as a whole, but perceive only one limb, at a time, whetting his appetite, all the more, for visualising the Lord’s Form, in its entirety. In this peculiar context, the Nāyakī would look upon the bewitching eyes of the Lord’s as but [death](/definition/death#history "show death definitions")-[dealing](/definition/dealing#history "show dealing definitions") twins.
