In the last decad, the Āḻvār fervently prayed that the Lord be pleased to turn His sweet glances on him, grant audience to him and the denizens of all the three worlds, remaining in a seated posture, beckon him or come down to him and permit him to stroke His lovely pair of feet and so on. The Lord, however, focussed the Saint’s attention on the fundamental relationship that subsists between them, which hardly affords scope for such entreaties by him and, much less, for the grief that results from the Lord’s apparent non-compliance. The basic fact of the Lord being none other than Nārāyaṇa, in whom all things and beings inhere and who abides in all, reduces all things and beings to the abject position of mere bodies unto the Life within, that dominates, directs, and supports them. Consoled thus by the Lord, in quite a convincing manner, the Saint not only regains his composure but admires the Lord’s tender solicitude for His subjects. This decad gives expression to the Saint’s rapturous admiration of the Lord’s great concern for His creatures and loving condescension. Having set out in VIII-8, the substance of the eight-lettered, three-syllabled Tirumantra and dwelt on the deep urge for Divine Service which ‘Āya’, the dative case-ending of the word ‘Nārāyaṇāya’ in the said Mantra reveals, the Āḻvār spells out the Mantra itself, in the opening song of this decad, which declares: “Nārāyaṇaṉ is our sole Benefactor”.
