**Tamil text and transliteration:**

அவன்கையதே எனதுஆர்உயிர் அன்றில் பேடைகாள்  
எவன்சொல்லி நீர்குடைந்துஆடுதிர் புடைசூழவே  
தவம்செய்தில்லா வினையாட்டியேன் உயிர் இங்குஉண்டோ  
எவன்சொல்லி நிற்றும் நும்ஏங்கு கூக்குரல் கேட்டுமே.

avaṉkaiyatē eṉatuāruyir aṉṟil pēṭaikāḷ  
evaṉcolli nīrkuṭaintuāṭutir puṭaicūḻavē  
tavamceytillā viṉaiyāṭṭiyēṉ uyir iṅkuuṇṭō  
evaṉcolli niṟṟum numēṅku kūkkural kēṭṭumē.

**English translation of verse 9.5.3:**

Know Ye not, Oh, female Aṉṟil birds,  
My life is entirely in His hands;  
Why do you unto your mates talk love  
Within my hearing and pull poor me down?  
My life is well on the point of ebbing out,  
Alas! the felicity this sinner lacks of keeping it *intact*.  
Can I at all subsist even after hearing your love-notes?

**Notes:**

The female Krauñca (Aṉṟil) birds, flirting with their males, present a picture entirely different from that of the Nāyakī, sunk deep in dejection. It is only when these birds tasted the bitter fruit of separation from their mates, they would realise the sad plight of the Nāyakī and sympathise with her. It is indeed much more than she can bear, these birds making merry, right in front of her. What is worse, unlike the Lord who wouldn’t mind His separation from the Nāyakī, for a while, the Nāyakī has not been endowed with the capacity to put up with even such momentary desertion by her beloved Lord and remain complacent. The Nāyakī feels that her life is ebbing out and that these birds, warbling their love-notes, are hell-bent to take her life out, not knowing that her life is in His hands. Did not the Āḻvār observe, in IV-3-8, “Oh, Lord, You made my soul Yours and Yours mine”?
