**[Tamil](/definition/tamil#history "show Tamil definitions") text and transliteration:**

புள்ளின் வாய் பிளந்தாய்! மருது இடை போயினாய்! எருது ஏழ் அடர்த்த என்-  
கள்ள மாயவனே! கருமாணிக்கச் சுடரே  
தெள்ளியார் திரு நான்மறைகள் வல்லார் மலி தண் சிரீவரமங்கை  
யுள் இருந்த எந்தாய்! அருளாய் உய்யுமாறு எனக்கே.

puḷḷiṉ vāy piḷantāy! marutu iṭai pōyiṉāy! erutu ēḻ aṭartta eṉ-  
kaḷḷa māyavaṉē! karumāṇikkac cuṭarē  
teḷḷiyār [tiru](/definition/tiru#history "show tiru definitions") nāṉmaṟaikaḷ vallār mali taṇ cirīvaramaṅkai  
yuḷ irunta entāy! aruḷāy uyyumāṟu eṉakkē.

**English translation of verse 5.7.9:**

My Lord, staying in cool Cirīvaramaṅkai where do dwell  
Many a [vedic](/definition/veda#vaishnavism "show vedic definitions") scholar with knowledge sound! You tamed the [bulls](/definition/bull#history "show bulls definitions"),  
Wondrous and tricky, the [bird](/definition/bird#history "show bird definitions")’s beak You did pull and quell,  
‘Tween the twin [trees](/definition/tree#history "show trees definitions") You crawled, oh Sire of sapphire hue!’  
Pray let me know the means of attaining You.

#### Note

In the preceding song, the [Āḻvār](/definition/aḻvar#vaishnavism "show Āḻvār definitions") laid two charges at the Lord’s door, namely, (i) he had been kept away from the Lord and (ii) he got bogged down in the difficult terrain of [samsāra](/definition/samsara#history "show samsāra definitions"). The Lord sent a feeler round, suggesting that it was due to his past sins he was in that predicament, to which this song is the rejoinder. Surely, the Āḻvār’s sins were not as tough as the evil forces referred to in this song, which the Lord destroyed effortlessly. Removal of the so-called impediment, in the case of the Āḻvār, was so very trivial that the Lord should not hesitate to cut it out and enable the Āḻvār to render service at the Lord’s feet, even as the pious Vaiṣṇavas of [Vāṉamāmalai](/definition/vanamamalai#vaishnavism "show Vāṉamāmalai definitions"), with blemishless knowledge, do.
