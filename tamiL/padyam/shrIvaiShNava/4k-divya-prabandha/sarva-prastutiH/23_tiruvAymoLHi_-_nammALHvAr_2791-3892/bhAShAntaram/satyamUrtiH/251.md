**Tamil text and transliteration:**

எக்காலத்து எந்தையாய் என்னுள் மன்னில், மற்று  
எக் காலத்திலும் யாதொன்றும் வேண்டேன்,  
மிக்கார் வேத விமலர் விழுங்கும், என்  
அக்காரக் கனியே உன்னை யானே.

ekkālattu entaiyāy eṉṉuḷ maṉṉil, maṟṟu  
ek kālattilum yātoṉṟum vēṇṭēṉ,  
mikkār vēta vimalar viḻuṅkum, eṉ  
akkārak kaṉiyē uṉṉai yāṉē.

**English translation of verse 2.9.8:**

You, Vedic scholars of rank and repute do (with love) devour,  
Oh, my candy- fruit, my eternal Master,  
If you shall my mind enter and stay there, firm and secure,  
Never shall I from you seek any other favour, (be sure).

**Notes**

\(i\) Rock-candy is a delicious product of cane-juice and it is the Āḻvār’s figment of imagination that conceives of the Lord being as delicious as the fruit of the imaginary Rock-candy tree, (akkārakkaṉi is the term used in the original text of this song, to denote this imaginary fruit of an imaginary tree).

\(ii\) The versification, as above, conforms to the interpretation of this song (original) by ‘Emperumāṉār’ (Rāmānuja). Śrī Āḷavantār (Yāmuṉa) would, however, appear to have interpreted this song, as follows:

> “My Lord, if you would only enter my heart, as my Sovereign Master, > even if it be for a split second, I shall not seek from you any > favour, at any other time, not even this very favour now sought”.
