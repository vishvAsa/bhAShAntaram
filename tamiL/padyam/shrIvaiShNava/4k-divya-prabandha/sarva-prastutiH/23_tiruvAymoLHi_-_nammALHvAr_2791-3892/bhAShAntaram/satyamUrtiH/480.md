+++
The Āḻvār, who was insensate in the last decad, due to the poignancy of his separation from the Lord, just regained consciousness, when the holy names of the Lord, chanted by the women around, trickled down his ears. This is like a creeper, dried up and lying low, becoming green again, when rain-drops fall on it. But then, it has only made matters worse for the Āḻvār. While in a state of coma, the patient feels no pain but when he regains consciousness, the pain becomes all the more acute. Hunger pinches a person to the marrow of his bone but luckily, sleep overtakes him. Hunger does not press its claim for the duration of his sleep but when he wakes up, the pangs of hunger are even more pronounced than before.

The Āḻvār keeps mulling how the Lord, who is a friend-in-need, capable of dispensing the appropriate remedies, could keep away from him. Unable to stand the separation, he cries out his heart so lustily that it melts down the hearts of his listeners too, as Sita did, during her captivity in Laṅkā.
