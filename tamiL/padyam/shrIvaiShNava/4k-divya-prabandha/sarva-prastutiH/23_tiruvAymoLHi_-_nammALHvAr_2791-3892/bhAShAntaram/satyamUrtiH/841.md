**[Tamil](/definition/tamil#history "show Tamil definitions") text and transliteration:**

தன்மை அறிபவர் தாம் அவற்கு ஆள்அன்றி ஆவரோ,  
பன்மைப் படர்பொருள் ஆதும்இல்பாழ் நெடும்காலத்து,  
நன்மைப் புனல்பண்ணி நான்முகனைப்பண்ணி தன்னுள்ளே  
தொன்மை மயக்கிய தோற்றிய சூழல்கள் சிந்தித்தே?

taṉmai aṟipavar tām avaṟku āḷaṉṟi āvarō,  
paṉmaip paṭarporuḷ ātumilpāḻ neṭumkālattu,  
naṉmaip puṉalpaṇṇi nāṉmukaṉaippaṇṇi taṉṉuḷḷē  
toṉmai mayakkiya tōṟṟiya cūḻalkaḷ cintittē?

**English translation of verse 7.5.4:**

Will those, that meditate on the grace galore of the Lord,  
Become the vassals of any but Him who put back the worlds  
In positions, as of old, creating the beneficent water first,  
And [Brahmā](/definition/brahma#vaishnavism "show Brahmā definitions"), the four-headed, next, finding all things lost  
For a whole eternity, in a state of veritable naught,  
When one thing could not from another be told, in His stomach caught?

**Notes:**

We can’t but belong to the Supreme, Lord, our Sole Master, the first cause of all things, who created the worlds of differences, with their assortments as [Devas](/definition/deva#vaishnavism "show Devas definitions"), humans, [birds](/definition/bird#history "show birds definitions") and [beasts](/definition/beast#history "show beasts definitions"), plants and things, still and mobile. It was indeed His grace galore that made Him sustain in His stomach all the worlds with their varied contents, without their being swept off, during the Great [deluge](/definition/deluge#history "show deluge definitions") (Mahāpralaya), a state of virtual non-existence or nothingness, pending the restoration of the old order of things in due course when He put them back in position. Is there any need then to specifically state that we can’t but belong to Him, our creator?
