**Tamil text and transliteration:**

இல்லதும் உள்ளதும் அல்லது அவன் உரு  
எல்லை இல் அந் நலம் புல்கு பற்று அற்றே.

illatum uḷḷatum allatu avaṉ uru  
ellai il an nalam pulku paṟṟu aṟṟē.

**English translation of verse 1.2.4:**

Renouncing all else, seek Him (*īśvara*) of *limitless* bliss, very different from the [seemingly] non-existent [fleeting and everchanging] material things and the ever-existing (non-changing) sentient beings [with their limiting adjuncts].

**Note**

An inexhaustible fountain of bliss that the Lord is, one has to attach oneself to such a fountain, only through a complete severance of attachment to the ephemeral and illusory worldly pleasures and distractions, with uncompromising rigidity; hence, this advice of the Āḻvār to the fellow-beings.
