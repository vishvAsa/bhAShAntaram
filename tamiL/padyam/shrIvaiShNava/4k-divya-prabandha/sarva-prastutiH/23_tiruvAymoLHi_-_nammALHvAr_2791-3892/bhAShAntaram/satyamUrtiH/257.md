**[Tamil](/definition/tamil#history "show Tamil definitions") text and transliteration:**

கிளர் ஒளி இளமை கெடுவதன் முன்னம்,  
வளர் ஒளி மாயோன் மருவிய கோயில்,  
வளர் இளம் பொழில் சூழ் மாலிருஞ்சோலை,  
தளர்வு இலர் ஆகிச் சார்வது சதிரே.

kiḷar oḷi iḷamai keṭuvataṉ muṉṉam,

**English translation of verse 2.10.1:**

Ere the youth, up and radiant, gets blasted  
‘Tis but meet that one reaches with a mind steadfast,  
Māliruñcōlai, the hill resort, full of orchards.  
Young and lovely, where stays always the wondrous Lord  
Of (growing splendour and) mounting radiance.

**Notes**

\(i\) Even reaching the holy place, ‘Tirumāliruñcōlai [Malai](/definition/malai#history "show Malai definitions")’, is an end in itself, says the [Āḻvār](/definition/aḻvar#vaishnavism "show Āḻvār definitions"). Even as one is advised to acquire knowledge when still young so as to reap the benefit thereof, in later years, one is advised to go to this pilgrim centre while still young and before the sensual pleasures get hold of the rising youth and distract it.

\(ii\) There is nothing like growth or diminution, waxing or waning for the Lord Who is immutable and yet, His Splendour is said to grow by virtue of the exhilarating impact of this lovely station on the Lord. This is sheer [poetic](/definition/poetry#history "show poetic definitions") grandeur [extolling](/definition/extolling#history "show extolling definitions") the beauty of the place.

\(iii\) This is one of the four principal [Vaiṣṇava](/definition/vaishnava#vaishnavism "show Vaiṣṇava definitions") Pilgrim centres,, the other three being [Śrīraṅgam](/definition/shrirangam#vaishnavism "show Śrīraṅgam definitions"), Tirumalai and [Kāñcīpuram](/definition/kancipura#vaishnavism "show Kāñcīpuram definitions").
