**[Tamil](/definition/tamil#history "show Tamil definitions") text and transliteration:**

வல்வினை தீர்க்கும் கண்ணனை வண் குருகூர்ச் சடகோபன்,  
சொல் வினையால் சொன்ன பாடல் ஆயிரத்துள் இவை பத்தும்,  
நல் வினை என்று கற்பார்கள் நலனிடை வைகுந்தம் நண்ணி,  
தொல்வினை தர எல்லாரும் தொழுது எழ வீற்றிருப்பாரே. (2)

**English translation of verse 4.4.11:**

Those that learn, with devotion great, these songs ten,  
Out of the thousand skilfully composed by Caṭakōpaṉ,  
Chief of fertile [Kurukūr](/definition/kurukur#vaishnavism "show Kurukūr definitions"), adoring Kaṇṇaṉ, the Redeemer  
Of sins, one and aḷḷ, will of all their sins be cured  
And attain the blissful [heaven](/definition/heaven#history "show heaven definitions"), revered by the Celestials over there.

**Notes**

\(i\) Unable to stand the [sufferings](/definition/suffering#history "show sufferings definitions") of the [Āḻvār](/definition/aḻvar#vaishnavism "show Āḻvār definitions") any longer, the Lord came down post-haste and relieved the Āḻvār of his erstwhile distress. That is why the Āḻvār calls Him, the great Redeemer of all sins. Even if the parents give up their daughter, the husband who took her by the hand, will never give her up. The Lord’s *paragata svīkāra*’ (i.e.) wooing His devotee and taking him within His grip always endures unlike the mother who finds herself helpless and plays the role of an anxious on-looker.

\(ii\) Those that learn this decad, either engrossed in its sweetness or banking on its potentiality for good, will attain the blissful Heaven, where there is no risk of separation from the Lord (viśleṣa), and have a royal reception, at the hands of the exalted band of ‘*[Nitya](/definition/nitya#vaishnavism "show Nitya definitions") Sūrīs*.’ (The ever-free, eternal angels).
