நகரமும் நாடுகளும் ஞானமும் மூடமும் ஆய்  
நிகர் இல் சூழ் சுடர் ஆய் இருள் ஆய் நிலன் ஆய் விசும்பு ஆய்  
சிகர மாடங்கள் சூழ் திருவிண்ணகர் சேர்ந்த பிரான்  
புகர் கொள் கீர்த்தி அல்லால் இல்லை யாவர்க்கும் புண்ணியமே.

**English translation of verse 6.3.3:**

For one and all, [salvation](/definition/salvation#history "show salvation definitions") lies only in the glowing grace  
Of the Lord in Tiruviṇṇakar, with its towering mansions,  
Who is at once hall and hamlet, intelligence and ignorance;  
The sky and Earth, pitched darkness and peerless brilliance.

#### Note

There are some, [enjoying](/definition/enjoying#history "show enjoying definitions") the luxuries of [life](/definition/life#history "show life definitions") in big cities with extra amenities while there are others, toiling hard and eking out a miserable existence in the [villages](/definition/village#history "show villages definitions") with no amenities whatsoever. Well, these are all controlled and regulated by the Lord. The correct perception of things, with due intelligence as well as misconception resulting from ignorance, light and darkness, the concrete Earth and the nebulous Sky, all these are directed by the Lord who resides in Tiruviṇṇakar, in His ‘[Arca](/definition/arca#history "show Arca definitions")’ (iconic) Form, wherein converge all His excellences in a perfect measure. It is here, in this land of darkness and nescience, that His auspicious qualities shine all the more, unlike the [Heaven](/definition/heaven#history "show Heaven definitions") where it is just like a [lamp](/definition/lamp#history "show lamp definitions") [burning](/definition/burning#history "show burning definitions") in broad day-light.
