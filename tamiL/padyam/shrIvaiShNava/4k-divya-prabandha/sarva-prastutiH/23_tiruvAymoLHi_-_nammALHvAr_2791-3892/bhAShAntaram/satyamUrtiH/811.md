The bliss of the union of the Nāyaki and Lord [Raṅganātha](/definition/ranganatha#vaishnavism "show Raṅganātha definitions") having overflown its continents, the Lord hit upon a method whereby the enjoyment could be stabilised instead of the Nāyaki being swept off by its exuberance. He went to Tentiruppēreyil, near the [Āḻvār](/definition/aḻvar#vaishnavism "show Āḻvār definitions")’s [birth](/definition/birth#history "show birth definitions")-place, game-[hunting](/definition/hunting#history "show hunting definitions") by way of relieving the distress of the people over there from the depredations of wild [animals](/definition/animal#history "show animals definitions"). The Nāyaki herself equipped Him with [weapons](/definition/weapon#history "show weapons definitions"), went with Him straight to the outer gate and bid Him farewell, wishing Him success. The Lord, mounted on [Garuḍa](/definition/garuda#vaishnavism "show Garuḍa definitions"), threw a bewitching parting glance at her. But then, she couldn’t bear the separation and insisted that she would also go to Tentiruppēreyil to join her Lord, in the face of opposition from her mother, mates and other, kinsmen. The Nāyakī, bent upon going, suggests a via-media namely, if they are against her going alone, they could as well escort her to the place and leave her there with her Lord.
