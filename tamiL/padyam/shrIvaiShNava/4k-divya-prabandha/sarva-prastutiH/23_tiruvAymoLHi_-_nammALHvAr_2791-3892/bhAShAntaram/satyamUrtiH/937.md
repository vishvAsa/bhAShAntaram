**English translation of verse 8.2.7:**

Ye, elders, with fragrant locks, flower-bedecked, Ye, my mates.  
His names, my Lord has made me cry out,  
As Māl, Ari, Kēcavaṉ, Nāraṇaṉ, Cīmātavaṉ, Kōvintaṉ, Vaikuṇṭaṉ, and so on,  
But of Him no trace could I see; what shall be done?  
Till the end of time, struggle shall I, on and on  
And see Him, sure and certain, let me swear,  
There’s indeed no link ‘tween you and me I am sure.

**Notes:**

\(i\) Even when the Lord keeps aloof, the subject cannot help pining for Him and [uttering](/definition/uttering#history "show uttering definitions") His sweet names, expressive of His auspicious attributes and wondrous deeds, as the sole means of subsistence. That is why Parāṅkuśa Nāyakī resent the advice tendered by her mates, not to attempt the unattainable but stay quiet. She would rather cut away from her kith and kin who can’t see eye to eye with her. (See the concluding para of the preamble to this decad) The Lord (Tirumāl) known to possess boundless love for His devotees, cannot keep away from them for long; He is Ari ([Hari](/definition/hari#vaishnavism "show Hari definitions")) the destroyer of all our sins which impede our union with Him; He is [Keśava](/definition/kesava#vaishnavism "show Keśava definitions"), whose dark, curly locks entrance the devotees and He should be fully aware that the Nāyakī would be musing over this sheer beauty, all the time; and then, He is Nārāyaṇā, of tender solicitude for the devotees, ‘Aśṛtavatsala’ and also ‘[Mādhava](/definition/madhava#vaishnavism "show Mādhava definitions")’ (Cirīmātavaṉ) Who, by reason of His conjunction with the Divine Mother (Śrī), would never give up the devotees; He is Kōvintaṉ ([Govinda](/definition/govinda#vaishnavism "show Govinda definitions")) Who subserves those that take refuge in Him and all these qualities only go to embellish His transcendent glory as ‘Vaikuntaṉ’ residing in that super-eminent abode, known as [Heaven](/definition/heaven#history "show Heaven definitions").

\(ii\) Although the Nāyakī called out the Lord’s names lustily, yet, He was nowhere in sight. When [Bharata](/definition/bharata#vaishnavism "show Bharata definitions") went to the [forest](/definition/forest#history "show forest definitions") to meet [Śrī Rāma](/definition/shrirama#history "show Śrī Rāma definitions"), the former could locate the latter’s residence with the aid of the smoke that shot up in the sky from the ritual-fire. But, in the Nāyakī’, case, currently there is no trace whatever of the Lord nor any clue regarding His whereabouts.
