**Tamil text and transliteration:**

நுங்கட்கு யான் உரைக்கேன் வம்மின் யான் வளர்த்த கிளிகாள்,  
வெம் கண் புள் ஊர்ந்து வந்து வினையேனை நெஞ்சம் கவர்ந்த  
செங்கண் கருமுகிலை செய்ய வாய்ச் செழுங் கற்பகத்தை,  
எங்குச் சென்றாகிலும் கண்டு இதுவோ தக்கவாறு என்மினே.

nuṅkaṭku yāṉ uraikkēṉ vammiṉ yāṉ vaḷartta kiḷikāḷ,  
vem kaṇ puḷ ūrntu vantu viṉaiyēṉai neñcam kavarnta  
ceṅkaṇ karumukilai ceyya vāyc ceḻuṅ kaṟpakattai,  
eṅkuc ceṉṟākilum kaṇṭu ituvō takkavāṟu eṉmiṉē.

**English translation of verse 6.8.5:**

Come here, ye, my pet parrots, let me unto you tell,  
*Be it anywhere*, You have to go and meet the cloud-hued Lord,  
The lotus-eyed, the wish-yielding tree, unique, mounted on the hot-eyed bird,  
Who unto me came and stole this sinner’s heart; Him do tell,  
‘Tis not meet that He should from me be apart.

#### Notes

\(i\) *Be it anywhere*: Go and ferret Him out, wherever He might be hiding, even as Hanumān solemnly resolved that he shall go to swarga  and find out Sītā even if he couldn’t locate her in Laṅkā. It is this phrase that gives the clue for the interpretation that this song deals with the ‘Antaryāmi’ (hidden or all-pervading) aspect of the Lord, as well.

\(ii\) *Unique wish—yielding tree*: What indeed makes the Lord unique, as distinguished from the legendary ‘Kaṟpaka’ tree, has been set out admirably in Īṭu commentary; The classical tree can only grant the wish of others; it has no wish of its own nor can it make over itself to others. But the Lord can and does, of His own will, give Himself over to His devotees. The Nāyakī feels that the Lord has gifted away to her both His vibhūtīs (the Eternal land and the sportive universe), in such a manner that she could, in turn, gift them away to any one of her choice.

\(iii\) The hot-eyed bird, referred to, in this song, is Garuḍa who frowns on the ungodly and blisters them with his looks.
