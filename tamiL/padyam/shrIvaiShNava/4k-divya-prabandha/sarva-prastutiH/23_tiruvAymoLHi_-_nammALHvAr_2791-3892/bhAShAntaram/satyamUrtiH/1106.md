**Tamil text and transliteration:**

கூக்குரல்கேட்டும் நம்கண்ணன் மாயன் வெளிப்படான்  
மேல்கிளை கொள்ளேல்மின் நீரும் சேவலும் கோழிகாள்  
வாக்கும்மனமும் கருமமும் நமக்குஆங்கதே  
ஆக்கையும் ஆவியும் அந்தரம் நின்றுஉழலுமே

kūkkuralkēṭṭum namkaṇṇaṉ māyaṉ veḷippaṭāṉ  
mēlkiḷai koḷḷēlmiṉ nīrum cēvalum kōḻikāḷ  
vākkummaṉamum karumamum namakkuāṅkatē  
ākkaiyum āviyum antaram niṉṟuuḻalumē

**English translation of verse 9.5.4:**

Ye, parrots, even Your amorous shouts  
Haven’t unto me brought Kaṇṇaṉ, our mystic Lord,  
Why then do you still coo so loud from that height?  
My word, deed and thought are beside Him sheltered  
But left in the lurch, my body and soul struggle a lot.

**Notes:**

The Nāyakī wonders why the amorous shouts of these merry birds, which could be heard all over, did not stir up her Lord’s emotions, in the same way as she reacted. She admonishes the parrots not to warble any more, in such high pitch and torment her, seeing that their cooings had not evoked the Lord’s response. The parrots would not, however, obey the Nāyakī and persisted in shouting. Apprehending that these birds were bent upon teasing her, the Nāyakī disclosed to them that her triple faculties of speech, thought and action had already fled over to the Lord and that the birds would, therefore, do well to shift their scene of activity to where her Lord was. The parrots could not swallow this statement of the Nāyakī, seeing that she was actually talking to them. The Nāyakī clarified that her body and soul were just tottering at this end and that she didn’t exist, in the real sense.
