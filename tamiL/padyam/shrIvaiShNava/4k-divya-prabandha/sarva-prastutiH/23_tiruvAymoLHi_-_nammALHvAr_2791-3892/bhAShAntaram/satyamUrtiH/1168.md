**Tamil text and transliteration:**

மாலைநண்ணித் தொழுதுஎழுமினோ வினைகெட  
காலைமாலை கமலமலர் இட்டு நீர்  
வேலைமோதும் மதிள்சூழ் திருக்கண்ணபுரத்து  
ஆலின்மேல்ஆல் அமர்ந்தான் அடிஇணைகளே. (2)

mālainaṇṇit toḻutueḻumiṉō viṉaikeṭa  
kālaimālai kamalamalar iṭṭu nīr  
vēlaimōtum matiḷcūḻ tirukkaṇṇapurattu  
āliṉmēlāl amarntāṉ aṭiiṇaikaḷē. (2)

**English translation of verse 9.10.1:**

Get near the Māl [Lord] at Tirukkaṇṇapuram, surrounded by walls,  
The oceanic waves dash against, the One that on a fig-leaf lay  
On a sheet of water vast and worship, ye. men, one and all,  
Placing lotus flowers at His lovely pair of feet, night and day  
And salvation attain, purged of your sins, one and all.

**Notes:**

\(i\) What the Āḻvār preaches, in this decad, is briefly mentioned here. There is indeed no restriction on the flowers with which the Lord is to be worshipped. No flower is taboo and, in the name of burning incense, as part of worship, even a heap of garbage could be burnt and smoke raised therefrom. The outward offerings may be trifles but, in God’s eyes, they carry much weight when offered with humility and devotion.

\(ii\) The sea seems to have receded from the township since; it might have been right on the sea-shore, with the billows breaking against the temple walls, during the days of the Āḻvār.
