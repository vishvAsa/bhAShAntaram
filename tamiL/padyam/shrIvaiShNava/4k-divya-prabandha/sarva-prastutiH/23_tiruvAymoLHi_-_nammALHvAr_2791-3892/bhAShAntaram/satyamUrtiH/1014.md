**Tamil text and transliteration:**

நன்றாய் ஞானம் கடந்துபோய் நல்இந்திரியம் எல்லாம் ஈர்த்து  
ஒன்றாய்க் கிடந்த அரும்பெரும்பாழ் உலப்புஇல் அதனை உணர்ந்துஉணர்ந்து  
சென்றுஆங்கு இன்பத் துன்பங்கள் செற்றுக் களைந்து பசைஅற்றால்  
அன்றே அப்போதேவீடு அதுவே வீடு வீடாமே.

naṉṟāy ñāṉam kaṭantupōy nalintiriyam ellām īrttu  
oṉṟāyk kiṭanta arumperumpāḻ ulappuil ataṉai uṇarntuuṇarntu  
ceṉṟuāṅku iṉpat tuṉpaṅkaḷ ceṟṟuk kaḷaintu pacaiaṟṟāl  
aṉṟē appōtēvīṭu atuvē vīṭu vīṭāmē.

**English translation of verse 8.8.6:**

If one can the cruel senses discard, going well beyond.  
The sense-objects and the sprawling domain of matter transcend,  
Discern the soul as a distinct entity and its true natu e comprehend.  
Abjure, with all one’s heart, the fruits of actions, good and bad,  
There and there lies the realisation of the soul from bondage freed.

**Notes:**

The Āḻvār sets out here the enormous effort needed for the perception of one’s soul, dissociated from its material moorings, through the Yogic practices, aimed at the conquest of the senses etc. The practicant has to discern, first of all, the soul as a separate entity, apart from the inert natter with which it is intricately wound up, like oil in seeds, fire in wood etc. The next step will be to get oneself weaned away from the sensual pleasures, the Prakṛti or matter-oriented desires, which are little better than one aspiring for a rich harvest in a vast desert area, a huge waste land, non-cultivable and, therefore, lying fallow. Even after giving up the inert matter as unavailing, the acts giving rise to the fruits, know as ‘Puṇya’ and ‘Papa’ will get one stuck up in worldly life. Therefore, these should also be given up with no chance of their revival, by striking at the roots and cutting out the age-long propensities and the odours driven underground. The soul, thus released from bondage, could, unless the practicant was short-sighted, merely looking upon such emancipation as the final goal, be steeped in the eternal service of the Lord without let or hindrance, the destined goal. The other alternative will be to get lost in self-enjoyment, the disembodied soul enjoying itself, without turning its attention on the service of the Lord. Of course, this alternative which the Āḻvār has elsewhere, in this hymnal, referred to as a great disaster, is indeed farthest from his mind.
