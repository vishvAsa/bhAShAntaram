சரணம்ஆகும் தனதாள் அடைந்தார்க்குஎல்லாம்  
மரணம்ஆனால் வைகுந்தம் கொடுக்கும்பிரான்  
அரண்அமைந்த மதிள்சூழ் திருக்கண்ணபுரத்  
தரணியாளன் தனதுஅன்பர்க்கு அன்புஆகுமே.

**English translation of verse 9.10.5:**

Unto those that seek refuge at His feet  
He is the perfect Protector indeed;  
Unto those that love Him with all their heart  
The Sovereign Lord is all love; the Ruler great  
Of Tirukkaṇṇapuram, enclosed by [walls](/definition/wall#history "show walls definitions"), safe and secure.  
Is the Benefactor great that heavenly bliss does dower  
At the fall of this material body, the outer cover.

**Notes:**

As already stated in the preamble to this decad, this is the topical song of this decad. The Lord, enshrined at Tirukkaṇṇapuram, vouchsafes heavenly bliss, at the end of the current span of [life](/definition/life#history "show life definitions"), unto those that seek refuge at His lovely pair of feet. This is the unfailing path of loving surrender at the Lord’s pair of feet, as the Sole means of [salvation](/definition/salvation#history "show salvation definitions"), which is open to one and all, unlike the discipline of ‘[Bhakti yoga](/definition/bhaktiyoga#vaishnavism "show Bhakti yoga definitions")’ indicated in the three preceding stanzas, restricted to certain categories of persons. The Lord having assured the [Āḻvār](/definition/aḻvar#vaishnavism "show Āḻvār definitions") that he would be granted entry into the High [Heavens](/definition/heaven#history "show Heavens definitions") as soon as his body falls off, the Āḻvār complacently styles the Lord as the “Granter of [Heaven](/definition/heaven#history "show Heaven definitions"), at one’s [death](/definition/death#history "show death definitions")”.
