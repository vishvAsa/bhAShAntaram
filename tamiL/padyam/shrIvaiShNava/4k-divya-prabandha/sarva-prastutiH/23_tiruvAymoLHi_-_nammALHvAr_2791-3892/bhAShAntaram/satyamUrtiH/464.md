**Tamil text and transliteration:**

உண்டும் உமிழ்ந்தும் கடந்தும் இடந்தும் கிடந்தும் நின்றும்,  
கொண்ட கோலத்தொடு வீற்றிருந்தும் மணம் கூடியும்,  
கண்ட ஆற்றால் தனதே உலகு என நின்றான் தன்னை,  
வண் தமிழ் நூற்க நோற்றேன் அடியார்க்கு இன்ப மாரியே.

uṇṭum umiḻntum kaṭantum iṭantum kiṭantum niṉṟum,  
koṇṭa kōlattoṭu vīṟṟiruntum maṇam kūṭiyum,  
kaṇṭa āṟṟāl taṉatē ulaku eṉa niṉṟāṉ taṉṉai,  
vaṇ tamiḻ nūṟka nōṟṟēṉ aṭiyārkku iṉpa māriyē.

**English translation of verse 4.5.10:**

Joy do I rain on devotees thro’ Tamil hymns fine,  
I have the fortune to compose, adoring Him, who, from time to time,  
Ate, spat, spanned and pulled out the worlds,  
Who (as Rāma) lay (on sea-front) and (victorious) stood  
(on the battlefield) and then sat for long, on the throne,  
Acts which, on the fact, proclaim Him as Sovereign Supreme.

**Notes**

\(i\) The Āḻvār feels doubly blessed, in that he not only renders service unto the Lord, by word of mouth, (Vācika Kaiṅkarya) but also regales His devotees, through his hymns. The Lord’s wondrous deeds and marvellous achievements, the Āḻvār recounts rapidly but with great ease. The Lord sustained, in His stomach, all the worlds, for the duration of the deluge and then let them out; He measured the worlds in three strides and on another occasion, retrieved the Earth from the ocean; He prostrated in front of the Indian ocean, invoking the help of the king of the ocean to bund it and cross over to Laṅkā and stood victorious, after Rāvaṇa was slain, granting audience to the Celestials, gathered in the outer space. After His return from exile Śrī Rāma ruled this land for eleven thousand years and thus graced the earth, rather held Mother Earth in His embrace. All these deeds of the Lord clearly establish His Sovereignty over the entire Universe, even as we recognise the earthly owners of lands from their various dealings, connected with the lands.

\(ii\) The Āḻvār is the joyous cloud, unleashing the rain of joy upon the Lord’s devotees through Tiruvāymoḻi.
