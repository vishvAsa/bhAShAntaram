அம்சிறைய மட நாராய்! அளியத்தாய்! நீயும் நின்  
அம்சிறைய சேவலுமாய் ஆஆ என்று எனக்கு அருளி  
வெம்சிறைப் புள் உயர்த்தார்க்கு என் விடு தூதாய்ச் சென்றக்கால்  
வன்சிறையில் அவன் வைக்கில் வைப்புண்டால் என் செயுமோ? (2)

**English translation of verse 1.4.1:**

Ye young, sympathetic Stork, with pretty plumes, taking pity on poor me, go with your [male](/definition/male#history "show male definitions") partner and deliver my message to the Lord on whose banner Is ([Garuḍa](/definition/garuda#vaishnavism "show Garuḍa definitions")) that [bird](/definition/bird#history "show bird definitions") with formidable plumes; If perchance He puts you in prison tough, what does it matter if you were to suffer on my behalf?

**Notes**

\(i\) The white wading [birds](/definition/bird#history "show birds definitions"), stork, crane and heron employed by the [Āḻvār](/definition/aḻvar#vaishnavism "show Āḻvār definitions") as emissaries to God, signify the preceptors, absolutely pure, in and out, standing four-square against the temptations of worldly [life](/definition/life#history "show life definitions"), just like these birds with tremendous staying powers, taking up firm positions in the watersheds, coolly resisting the onslaught of the waves.[^1]

\(ii\) It may be noted that the help of the male stork is solicited through the female, following the imperative need for seeking the Lord through the good offices of the Divine Mother, the grand Intercessor between God and man.

[^1]:  Aphorism 154, Ācārya hṛdayam.

\(iii\) Putting the birds in prison should not be taken literally and, in fact, it is most unlikely that the Lord would ever do so, It would indeed be worse than putting them in the toughest prison if He just remained cold and indifferent and would not even look at them, an experience comparable with that of the Princes not getting fed when hunger pinches them.
