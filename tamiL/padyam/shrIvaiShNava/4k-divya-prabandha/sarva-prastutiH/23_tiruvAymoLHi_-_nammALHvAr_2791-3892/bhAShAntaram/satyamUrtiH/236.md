**Tamil text and transliteration:**

தீர்த்தன் உலகு அளந்த சேவடிமேல் பூந்தாமம்,  
சேர்த்தி அவையே சிவன் முடிமேல் தான் கண்டு,  
பார்த்தன் தெளிந்தொழிந்த பைந்துழாயான் பெருமை,  
பேர்த்தும் ஒருவரால் பேசக் கிடந்ததே?

tīrttaṉ ulaku aḷanta cēvaṭimēl pūntāmam,  
cērtti avaiyē civaṉ muṭimēl tāṉ kaṇṭu,  
pārttaṉ teḷintoḻinta paintuḻāyāṉ perumai,  
pērttum oruvarāl pēcak kiṭantatē?

**English translation of verse 2.8.6:**

Is there any need at all for others to deliberate  
The glory of (Lord Kṛṣṇa) wearing tulacī garland, Tīrttaṉ (The Immaculate),  
At whose lovely feet which spanned the Universe, Pārttaṉ placed a garland  
And saw it (a little later) on Śiva’s head, getting clarity of mind?

**Note**

In the battle against the “Kauravas Arjuṉa needed the weapon known as ‘Pāśupada astra’ which could be had from Śiva after due propitiation. The compassionate Kṛṣṇa, however, told Arjuṉa the short-cut whereby he could offer at the former’s feet the garland intended for Paśupati (Śiva). Arjuṉa did accordingly and that very night, Śiva appeared in Arjuṉa’s dream, wearing that very same garland on the head and presented the weapon in question. Reference has been made, in this song, to the spanning of the whole Universe by the Lord as it was then that Brahmā washed the Lord’s feet to the accompaniment of Vedic chantings, and the sacred water that flowed down the Lord’s feet was held by Śiva on his head (Nāṉmukaṉ Tiruvantāti-9). Is there at all any need to dispute the self-evident glory of Lord Kṛṣṇa?
