**Tamil text and transliteration:**

வீவு இல் இன்பம்மிக எல்லை நிகழ்ந்த நம் அச்சுதன்,  
வீவு இல் சீரன் மலர்க் கண்ணன் விண்ணோர் பெருமான் தன்னை,  
வீவு இல் காலம் இசைமாலைகள் ஏத்தி மேவப்பெற்றேன்,  
வீவு இல் இன்பம்மிக எல்லை நிகழ்ந்தனன் மேவியே.

vīvu il iṉpammika ellai nikaḻnta nam accutaṉ,  
vīvu il cīraṉ malark kaṇṇaṉ viṇṇōr perumāṉ taṉṉai,  
vīvu il kālam icaimālaikaḷ ētti mēvappeṟṟēṉ,  
vīvu il iṉpammika ellai nikaḻntaṉaṉ mēviyē.

**English translation of verse 4.5.3:**

Dwell do I at the very acme of bliss perennial,  
Having attained Accutan, my Lord, Chief of Celestials,  
Of limitless glory and eternal bliss, with red-lotus eyes,  
By incessant praise thro’ hymns mellifluous.

**Notes**

\(i\) The bliss that the Āḻvār experiences, as a result of singing Tiruvāymoḻi', is not merely unlimited but also supreme. Unlike the Veda Puruṣa, who attempted the impossible in trying to gauge the extent of the Lord’s bliss and had to acknowledge defeat, the Āḻvār has, right from the beginning, been declaring that the Lord is an inexhaustible fountain of bliss. And now, he finds that the bliss derived by him by singing the Lord’s praise through his scintillating hymns is also endless and supreme, there being nothing higher than this.

\(ii\) The tefl-tale lotus eyes of the Lord proclaim His Sovereignty over all the worlds. It is not as if there is none to enjoy the Lord’s charming eyes, like unto moon-shine wasted over the depopulated jungle, as we are likely to conclude, seeing the men over here turning their faces against Him; the whole lot of Celestials, the denizens in the yonder heaven, stand rivetted to these eyes, enthralled by their magic spell.
