**Tamil text and transliteration:**

குழையும் வாள் முகத்து ஏழையைத் தொலைவில்லிமங்கலம் கொண்டுபுக்கு,  
இழை கொள் சோதிச் செந்தாமரைக் கண்பிரான் இருந்தமை காட்டினீர்,  
மழை பெய்தால் ஒக்கும் கண்ண நீரினொடு அன்று தொட்டும் மையாந்து, இவள்  
நுழையும் சிந்தையள் அன்னைமீர்! தொழும் அத் திசை உற்று நோக்கியே.

kuḻaiyum vāḷ mukattu ēḻaiyait tolaivillimaṅkalam koṇṭupukku,  
iḻai koḷ cōtic centāmaraik kaṇpirāṉ iruntamai kāṭṭiṉīr,  
maḻai peytāl okkum kaṇṇa nīriṉoṭu aṉṟu toṭṭum maiyāntu, ivaḷ  
nuḻaiyum cintaiyaḷ aṉṉaimīr! toḻum at ticai uṟṟu nōkkiyē.

**English translation of verse 6.5.5:**

Ye, mothers, this lady with forehead bright, deeply absorbed  
In the Lord’s auspicious traits, unto Tolaivillimaṅkalam you brought  
And showed her the lotus-eyed Lord of bejewelled radiance;  
Rapturous she is since, with tears torrential in her eyes  
And with a heart in His beauty rooted, in that very direction she gazes.

#### Notes

\(i\) The effulgence of the God-love within is reflected on the Nāyakī’s forehead. By her very nature, she would thaw down in ecstasy, in deep contemplation of the Lord and now that she has been brought by the elders, face to face, with the radiant Lord, bedecked with jewels, at Tolaivillimaṅkalam, her God-intoxication has gone to a very high pitch. The Lord, even when unadorned, is extremely charming and now, He is adorned, imparting lustre to the Jewels on His person. Unto Him, so exquisite, the elders brought the Nāyakī who just fainted in ecstasy and even after she recovered, she would not lift her mind off Him and kept gazing in the direction of the Pilgrim centre, c.f. ‘Ekastha hṛdayā nūnaṃ Rāmamevānupaśyati’ (Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, Sundara Kāṇḍa) So then, the chances of the elders getting the Nāyakī restored to them were next to nil. The Nāyakī’s love is unceasingly whirling, like the whirlpool in a stream, boring deeper and deeper but never scattering and passing away.

\(ii\) *The torrential tears*: When Maṇakkāl Nampi discoursed about God, Āḷavantār (later. Saint Yāmunācārya), the Royal listener caught the spark all right and exclaimed that he Just can’t exist without beholding Him. Struck by this wonderful response, the great preceptor led Āḷavantār to the august presence of Lord Raṅganātha, on seeing Whom. Yāmuna broke into tears, full and flooding. Like unto the dry match-stick, which readily strikes fire, the devout have but to be told about God and the heart immediately yearns to see Him; He has but to be seen and it makes them weep with tears of joy like Saint Nammāḻvār.
