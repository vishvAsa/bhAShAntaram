**Tamil text and transliteration:**

என்றும் ஒன்று ஆகி ஒத்தாரும் மிக்கார்களும், தன் தனக்கு -  
இன்றி நின்றானை எல்லா உலகும் உடையான் தன்னை,  
குன்றம் ஒன்றால் மழை காத்த பிரானை சொல் மாலைகள்,  
நன்று சூட்டும் விதி எய்தினம் என்ன குறை நமக்கே?

eṉṟum oṉṟu āki ottārum mikkārkaḷum, taṉ taṉakku -  
iṉṟi niṉṟāṉai ellā ulakum uṭaiyāṉ taṉṉai,  
kuṉṟam oṉṟāl maḻai kātta pirāṉai col mālaikaḷ,  
naṉṟu cūṭṭum viti eytiṉam eṉṉa kuṟai namakkē?

**English translation of verse 4.5.7:**

Blest that we are to offer garlands of hymns  
Unto the Benefactor great, who repelled the rains,  
Holding the mount aloft, with none above or equal to Him,  
Sovereign master of all the worlds, who constant remains  
For ever, could there for us be any want?

**Notes**

\(i\) In the preceding song, the Āḻvār declared that he is free from wants of any kind and shall be above wants in the days to come as well. This night sound boastful but such a stance on his part is attributable to his authorship of the marvellous hymns, the Tiruvāymoḻi, which again is due to the Lord’s grace, a fact emphasised in this song.

\(ii\) The Lord is constant ard unchanging, whatever be His modes. In all His five manifestations, of ‘Para Vyūha’, ‘Vibhava’, ‘Antaryāmi’ and ‘Arcā’ the Lord has none above or equal to Him. Even so, it is in His Incarnate (Vibhava) Forms, that He excels. In fact, He excels in His trait of ‘Āśṛta-pāratantra’ (subservience to His devotees) for which His incarnations afford the maximum scope and there is hardly any equal for Him, in this respect.
