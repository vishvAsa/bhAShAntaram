**Tamil text and transliteration:**

தொழுது ஆடி தூ மணி வண்ணனுக்கு ஆட்செய்து நோய் தீர்ந்த  
வழுவாத தொல்புகழ் வண் குருகூர்ச் சடகோபன், சொல்  
வழுவாத ஆயிரத்துள் இவை பத்து வெறிகளும்,  
தொழுது ஆடிப் பாடவல்லார் துக்க சீலம் இலர்களே.

toḻutu āṭi tū maṇi vaṇṇaṉukku āṭceytu nōy tīrnta  
vaḻuvāta tolpukaḻ vaṇ kurukūrc caṭakōpaṉ, col  
vaḻuvāta āyirattuḷ ivai pattu veṟikaḷum,  
toḻutu āṭip pāṭavallār tukka cīlam ilarkaḷē.

**English translation of verse 4.6.11:**

They will of miseries be rid that recite, adoring and dancing.  
These songs ten, deprecating those that go about appeasing  
Minor deities, out of the flawless thousand of Caṭakōpaṉ,  
Chief of lovely Kurukūr, of flawless fame in-born,  
Who danced in adoration of the lovely Lord, gem-hued  
And serving Him, with devotion great, got his sickness cured.

**Notes**

\(i\) This decad has clearly brought out the Āḻvār’s unflinching and exclusive devotion to Lord Viṣṇu (Śrīman Nārāyaṇa), of sapphire hue and his intolerance of those who stray into the domain of worship of the minor deities The elderly women listened to the mate’s advice, at long last, and by adoring the Supreme Lord and dancing, in a body, singing His praise, they did help the Nāyakī regain her consciousness. It is not as if she got a cure as such, much less a complete cure. Actually, it is an incurable malady, not being of the ordinary run. This God-sickness lasts as long as the Soul exists and the Soul never dies.

\(ii\) This end-song confers the boon of relief from all miseries, particularly, the pangs of misery of separation from the Lord, like those undergone by the Āḻvār, on all those who recite these ten songs, with great devotion. The chanters will not run the miserable risk of contamination by straying into the domain of worship of minor deities.
