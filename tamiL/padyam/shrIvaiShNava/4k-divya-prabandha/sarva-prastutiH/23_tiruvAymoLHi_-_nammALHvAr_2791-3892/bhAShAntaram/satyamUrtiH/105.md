**Tamil text and transliteration:**

சங்கு சக்கரம், அங்கையில் கொண்டான்,  
எங்கும் தானாய, நங்கள் நாதனே.

caṅku cakkaram, aṅkaiyil koṇṭāṉ,  
eṅkum tāṉāya, naṅkaḷ nātaṉē.

**English translation of verse 1.8.9:**

Conch and discus, our Lord holds in His lovely hands  
No matter where and in what form He descends.

**Note**

The Lord who thus incarnates, for my sake, through different gates of birth, always bears the inseparable Conch and Discus, like unto the potion carried by some to entice people. These may, however, be visible only to some Godly souls and not all. The Lord’s descent could be likened to the Earthly Kings moving round their cities during nights, disguised in black clothes, to study men and matters at first hand, and locate miscreants operating under cover of darkness. The security forces or bodyguards also keep stirring about during those occasions, suitably masked, ready at hand, in an emergency call from the King. The Conch and Discus and other intimate attendants of the Lord, likewise, keep Him company during the Avatāras.
