**Tamil text and transliteration:**

உணர்வில்உம்பர் ஒருவனை அவனது அருளால் உறற்பொருட்டு என்  
உணர்வின்உள்ளே இருத்தினேன் அதுவும் அவனது இன்அருளே  
உணர்வும் உயிரும் உடம்பும் மற்று உலப்பிலனவும் பழுதேயாம்  
உணர்வைப் பெறஊர்ந்துறஏறி யானும் தானாய் ஒழிந்தானே.

uṇarvilumpar oruvaṉai avaṉatu aruḷāl uṟaṟporuṭṭu eṉ  
uṇarviṉuḷḷē iruttiṉēṉ atuvum avaṉatu iṉaruḷē  
uṇarvum uyirum uṭampum maṟṟu ulappilaṉavum paḻutēyām  
uṇarvaip peṟaūrntuṟaēṟi yāṉum tāṉāy oḻintāṉē.

**English translation of verse 8.8.3:**

To get at the overlord of the celestials of knowledge profound,  
I did His grace invoke, impounding Him in my thoughtful desires;  
Even this act of mine was by His sweet grace ordained,  
Getting inside me thus, He did make me wholly averse  
To the earthly moorings, body and soul, pleasures sensual  
And allied knowledge; He did unto me fully reveal  
The essential nature of the soul, as His exclusive vassal,  
Who can’t, apart from Him, remain viable.

**Notes:**

By His spontaneous grace, the Supreme Lord made the Āḻvār God-bent and also revealed unto him, the true nature of his Soul, in order to stabilise his God-love, to the exclusion of everything else. The true nature of the Soul, as belonging to the Lord, as His exclusive vassal, and remaining but His mode, His very body, was disclosed to the Āvḻār so that he shall not shrink back from Him, any longer.
