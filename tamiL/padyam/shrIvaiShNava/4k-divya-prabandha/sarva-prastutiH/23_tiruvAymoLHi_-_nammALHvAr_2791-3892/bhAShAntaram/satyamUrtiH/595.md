**Tamil text and transliteration:**

கொடிய வினை யாதும் இலனே என்னும் கொடிய வினை ஆவேனும் யானே என்னும்  
கொடிய வினை செய்வேனும் யானே என்னும் கொடிய வினை தீர்ப்பேனும் யானே என்னும்  
கொடியான் இலங்கை செற்றேனே என்னும் கொடிய புள் உடையவன் ஏறக்கொலோ?  
கொடிய உலகத்தீர்க்கு இவை என் சொல்லுகேன் கொடியேன் கொடி என் மகள் கோலங்களே?

koṭiya viṉai yātum ilaṉē eṉṉum koṭiya viṉai āvēṉum yāṉē eṉṉum  
koṭiya viṉai ceyvēṉum yāṉē eṉṉum koṭiya viṉai tīrppēṉum yāṉē eṉṉum  
koṭiyāṉ ilaṅkai ceṟṟēṉē eṉṉum koṭiya puḷ uṭaiyavaṉ ēṟakkolō?  
koṭiya ulakattīrkku ivai eṉ collukēṉ koṭiyēṉ koṭi eṉ makaḷ kōlaṅkaḷē?

**English translation of verse 5.6.9:**

Unto you, importunate worldlings, what can I say  
About the antics lovely of this sinner’s daughter, like unto a creeper?  
Aloof she stands from (the subjects’) evil acts, she says  
While in evil acts persist (those that do her displeasure incur),  
Again, she it is that cures the (devotees’) fell sins and passes  
Them on to (their opponents) others, ‘tis she that reduced to ashes  
The felon’s Laṅkā; is she by Him possessed who bears  
The bird tough (unto His opponents) on His banner?

#### Note

The sentient and non-sentient beings are the Lord’s bodies. He is thus the ‘Viśeṣya’ or Substance present in all these bodies, known as the ‘Viśeṣaṇa’, the attributes or modes of the Lord. While the attributes undergo transformations, such as growth and decay, enjoyment and misery, the ‘Viśeṣya’ undergoes no changes and is ‘nirvikāra’. While the ‘Jīva’ or the individual Soul experiences alternately, weal and woe, the Lord inside the ‘Jīva’ remains unattached to the fruits of the actions of the Jīva. While the body, the outer cloak of the ‘Jīva’, is imposed on the latter by dint of its past ‘Karma’ (acts), the Lord enters the Jīva, as a matter of grace, not bound by the compulsions of a pre-determined factor. Creation actually means that He makes the non-sentient things undergo the changes of state and endows the individual souls with bodies and senseorgans, thus providing the necessary scope for expansioṇ of their knowledge. The disparities in the created beings, some being happy and others sorrowful, will not, however, render the Lord guilty of partiality and cruelty. The inequalities are the direct results of the actions of the individuals, and their sufferings are intended to chasten them and cure their ills through a cleansing process.
