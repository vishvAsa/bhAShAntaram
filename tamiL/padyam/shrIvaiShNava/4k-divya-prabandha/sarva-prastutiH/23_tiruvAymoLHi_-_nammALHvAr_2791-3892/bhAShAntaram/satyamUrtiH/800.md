**Tamil text and transliteration:**

என் செய்கின்றாய் என் தாமரைக் கண்ணா! என்னும் கண்ணீர்மல்க இருக்கும்,  
என் செய்கேன் எறிநீர்த் திருவரங்கத்தாய்? என்னும் வெவ்வுயிர்த்துஉயிர்த்து உருகும்:  
முன்செய்த வினையே! முகப்படாய் என்னும் முகில்வண்ணா! தகுவதோ? என்னும்,  
முன்செய்து இவ்உலகம் உண்டுஉமிழ்ந்துஅளந்தாய்! என்கொலோமுடிகின்றது இவட்கே?

eṉ ceykiṉṟāy eṉ tāmaraik kaṇṇā! eṉṉum kaṇṇīrmalka irukkum,  
eṉ ceykēṉ eṟinīrt tiruvaraṅkattāy? eṉṉum vevvuyirttuuyirttu urukum:  
muṉceyta viṉaiyē! mukappaṭāy eṉṉum mukilvaṇṇā! takuvatō? eṉṉum,  
muṉceytu ivulakam uṇṭuumiḻntuaḷantāy! eṉkolōmuṭikiṉṟatu ivaṭkē?

**English translation of verse 7.2.2:**

“My lotus-eyed Lord, unto me what will you do?”  
Is the question by this lady put, her eyes filled with tears,  
She stands still and queries again, ‘What shall I do  
To get at you, oh, Lord of Tiruvaraṅkam with surging waters?’  
Says she, panting and breathing hot, “Come before me, my past sins,”,  
‘Oh cloud-hued Lord! is this all your mercy?’, unto this girl tense,  
Say what will happen, Oh, Lord, Who the worlds did create,  
Are and spat, spanned and did many such things, them to protect?

**Notes:**

\(i\) The Nāyakī would like to know what those massive sins committed by her, are, which stand between her and the Lord. That only shows, she is painfully conscious of the fact that she has to face the consequences of her past sins, instead of blaming the Lord. But then, the cloud-hued Lord, known for His munificence like the rain-clouds, could, in the exercise of His quality of mercy, wipe off the sins, *in toto*, and in no time.

\(ii\) Breathing hot, the Nāyakī melts under the impact of that heat as if she isn’t there to sigh anymore.

\(iii\) So great is the heat generated by her separation from the Lord that she would like to be thrown by some one into the cool waters of the river Kāvēri in Śrīraṅgam, the river Tāmraparṇi in her birth place having already become hot because of her desolation.
