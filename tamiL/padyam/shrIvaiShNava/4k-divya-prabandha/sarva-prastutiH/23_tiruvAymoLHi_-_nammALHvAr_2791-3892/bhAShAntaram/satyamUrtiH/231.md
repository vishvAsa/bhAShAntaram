**Tamil text and transliteration:**

அணைவது அரவு அணைமேல் பூம்பாவை ஆகம்  
புணர்வது, இருவர் அவர் முதலும் தானே,  
இணைவன் ஆம் எப் பொருட்கும் வீடு முதல் ஆம்,  
புணைவன் பிறவிக்கடல் நீந்துவார்க்கே.

aṇaivatu aravu aṇaimēl pūmpāvai ākam  
puṇarvatu, iruvar avar mutalum tāṉē,  
iṇaivaṉ ām ep poruṭkum vīṭu mutal ām,  
puṇaivaṉ piṟavikkaṭal nīntuvārkkē.

**English translation of verse 2.8.1:**

The Supreme Lord who does on serpent-bed repose  
And hold Pūmpāvai (Lakṣmī, the lotus-born) in embrace  
Is Progenitor of them both (Brahmā and Śiva); He freely descends  
Among all and sundry, Granter of Mokṣa, the raft (sure and certain)  
He is, to swim across (Saṃsāra) the difficult and dreadful ocean.

**Notes**

\(i\) This stanza is an epitome of the contents of this decad.

\(ii\) The first two lines of the stanza bring out the setting in the Eternal land of absolute bliss (*Nitya Vibhūti*). So far as the “*Līlā Vibhūti* (Sportive Universe) is concerned, the Lord is depicted as the originator of one and all, including those two calling for special attention, the exalted Brahmā and Rudra and yet He incarnates among all and sundries, as if He is of their own species and mingles with them freely.

Being the granter of Mokṣa, He is the raft, safe and sound, to get hold of for those who are keen on crossing the ocean of ‘Saṃsāra’ with its terrific involvement in the cycle of birth and death and seek His help, finding that, by themselves, they can hardly cross this ocean, vast and deep.
