**Tamil text and transliteration:**

உலகில் திரியும் கரும கதி ஆய் உலகம் ஆய்,  
உலகுக்கே ஓர் உயிரும் ஆனாய் புற அண்டத்து,  
அலகில் பொலிந்த திசை பத்து ஆய அருவேயோ,  
அலகில் பொலிந்த அறிவிலேனுக்கு அருளாயே.

ulakil tiriyum karuma kati āy ulakam āy,  
ulakukkē ōr uyirum āṉāy puṟa aṇṭattu,  
alakil polinta ticai pattu āya aruvēyō,  
alakil polinta aṟivilēṉukku aruḷāyē.

**English translation of verse 6.9.7:**

My Lord, You are the Super-Soul of both the visible and the invisible,  
The acts and the performers in all the worlds besides the souls innumerable  
In the regions afar, the released souls whose knowledge permeates  
Ten directions; shed unto me, with failings innumerable, Your sweet grace.

#### Notes

The sentient beings (intelligent souls, embodied) and the non-sentient matter, which constitute the worlds, form the body of God and they are inseparably related to Him, as attributes are to a substance, body to the soul.

Whosoever performs acts as the means for securing certain objectives, owes the very performance of those acts to the Lord who endowed them with body and limbs but for which they can’t function in the manner they are doing. And then, the reward due. in respect of such performance, is also made by Him.
