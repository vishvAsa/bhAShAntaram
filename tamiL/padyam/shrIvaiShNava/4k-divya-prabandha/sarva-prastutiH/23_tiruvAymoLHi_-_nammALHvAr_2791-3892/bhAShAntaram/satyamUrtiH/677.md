**Tamil text and transliteration:**

ஆய்ச்சி ஆகிய அன்னையால் அன்று வெண்ணெய் வார்த்தையுள் சீற்ற முண்டு அழு-  
கூத்த அப்பன் தன்னை குருகூர்ச் சடகோபன்  
ஏத்திய தமிழ் மாலை ஆயிரத்துள் இவையும் ஓர் பத்து இசை யொடும்  
நாத்தன்னால் நவில உரைப்பார்க்கு இல்லை நல்குரவே. (2)

āycci ākiya aṉṉaiyāl aṉṟu veṇṇey vārttaiyuḷ cīṟṟa muṇṭu aḻu-  
kūtta appaṉ taṉṉai kurukūrc caṭakōpaṉ  
ēttiya tamiḻ mālai āyirattuḷ ivaiyum ōr pattu icai yoṭum  
nāttaṉṉāl navila uraippārkku illai nalkuravē. (2)

**English translation of verse 6.2.11:**

Those that chant tunefully these songs ten  
Out of the thousand Tamil songs of Caṭakōpaṉ  
Of Kurukūr, adoring the Lord, Who (as child Kṛṣṇa) cried bitter  
When someone complained, in general, about the theft of butter,  
Unto His mother, will never from poverty (of God-love) suffer.

**Notes:**

\(i\) Here is a splendid reference to one of the many infant sports of the Lord. The shepherdesses of Bṛndāvaṉ complained to Yaśodha that all their butter had been stolen by some one. Just on hearing this g neral complaint without any mention about Him in particular, child Kṛṣṇa cried immediately, as if to plead that He was not the culprit. Thus, by His own unbidden cry, He betrayed Himself as the urchin thief. An interesting parallel for this is cited in Īṭu commentary. One day, the residents of a mutt (Monastery) asked among themselves as to who should clean and water the monastery and it was decided that the unlearned (uninitiated in the Vedas) among them should be detailed for such menial service. One among them immediately cried (although nobody had spotted him out, as the unlearned): “Sirs, how can I clean such a big place as this?” Poor fellow, he betrayed himself by this spontaneous cry, unnamed and unsought.

\(ii\) The Lord’s grief, at His repulsion by the Gopis, shutting the door against Him, was just as poignant as when He was tied to the pounder by His mother, as a punishment for stealing butter.
