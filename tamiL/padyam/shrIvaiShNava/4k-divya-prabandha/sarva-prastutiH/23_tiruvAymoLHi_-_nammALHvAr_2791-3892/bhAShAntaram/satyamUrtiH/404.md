**Tamil text and transliteration:**

உய்ம்மின் திறைகொணர்ந்து என்று உலகு ஆண்டவர், இம்மையே  
தம் இன்சுவை மடவாரைப் பிறர் கொள்ளத் தாம் விட்டு  
வெம் மின் ஒளிவெயில் கானகம் போய்க் குமைதின்பர்கள்,  
செம்மின் முடித் திருமாலை விரைந்து அடி சேர்மினோ.

uymmiṉ tiṟaikoṇarntu eṉṟu ulaku āṇṭavar, immaiyē  
tam iṉcuvai maṭavāraip piṟar koḷḷat tām viṭṭu  
vem miṉ oḷiveyil kāṉakam pōyk kumaitiṉparkaḷ,  
cemmiṉ muṭit tirumālai viraintu aṭi cērmiṉō.

**English translation of verse 4.1.2:**

Lose no time in worshipping ‘Tirumāl’, with lustrous crown,  
Seeing that the earthly overlords who did dominate for long,  
With many a minor Chief paying unto them tributes, grow forlorn,  
Losing, in this very birth, their kingdoms and consorts dear  
And eke out miserable existence in the formidable forest yonder.

**Notes**

\(i\) Even those mighty kings who held sway for long, keeping under their heels many a chieftain forced to pay them tributes, lose their vast kingdoms and become helpless spectators when the lovely damsels kept in their proud harem, are forcibly seized by others under their very nose. If this happens to the mighty overlords what to say about the lesser men and their so-called riches? The Āḻvār, therefore, calls upon his fellow-beings to worship the feet of Lord Viṣṇu (Tirumāl) and attain Him, the Eternal Wealth, the inexhaustible fountain of perennial bliss.

\(ii\) The Paṇḍavas who celebrated the ‘Rājasūya Yāga’ with great pomp and eclat, had to retire into the forest and their wife, Draupadi, was badly handled under their very nose.

\(iii\) Unto those who seek Him, the Lord is there to part with His very crown; there are His consorts to plead for us and get from the Lord His choicest favours and yet, the default lies on our past, in not hastening.
