**Tamil text and transliteration:**

தீர்த்தனுக்கு அற்றபின் மற்று ஓர் சரண் இல்லை என்று எண்ணி தீர்த்தனுக்கே  
தீர்த்த மனத்தனன் ஆகி செழுங் குருகூர்ச் சடகோபன் சொன்ன,  
தீர்த்தங்கள் ஆயிரத்துள் இவை பத்தும் வல்லார்களைத், தேவர் வைகல்  
தீர்த்தங்களே என்று பூசித்து நல்கி உரைப்பர் தம் தேவியர்க்கே. (2)

tīrttaṉukku aṟṟapiṉ maṟṟu ōr caraṇ illai eṉṟu eṇṇi tīrttaṉukkē  
tīrtta maṉattaṉaṉ āki ceḻuṅ kurukūrc caṭakōpaṉ coṉṉa,  
tīrttaṅkaḷ āyirattuḷ ivai pattum vallārkaḷait, tēvar vaikal  
tīrttaṅkaḷē eṉṟu pūcittu nalki uraippar tam tēviyarkkē. (2)

**English translation of verse 7.10.11:**

Unto their spouses shall ever say the Celestials in Heaven,  
That those well-versed in these songs ten  
Out of the immaculate thousand of Kurukūr Caṭakōpaṉ,  
Dedicated to the immaculate Lord, as the sole Means  
Are indeed very pure, entitled to great reverence.

**Notes:**

\(i\) It has been given out here, as the benefit accruing to those chanting this decad, that the Eternal Heroes (Nitya Sūrīs), in Heaven, shall honour them a great deal and refer to them as of great sanctity, while talking to their spouses at the height of their joy born of their blemishless service unto Lord Vaikuṇṭanātha (the transcendent Lord in Heaven, in His ‘Para’ aspect). It is then that they feel inclined to divulge the secrets to their dear ones, even as the redoubted saint Rāmānuja divulged to those, eagerly assembled in front, the purport of the ‘Carama Śloka’, notwithstanding the oath of secrecy administered to him by his master, Goṣṭipūrṇar. Garuḍa has two wives, by name, Rudrā and Sukīrti while the wife of Śenāpathi (Cēṉai Mutaliyār) is Sūtravati. These pre-eminent ‘Nityās’ would always speak in superlative terms about the chanters of this decad.

\(ii\) *The Lord immaculate*: Himself of impeccable purity, He is also the great Sanctifier, Who renders His votaries also absolutely pure. River Gaṅgā got sanctified by the touch of His feet and Śiva, in turn, got sanctified by holding Gangā on his matted locks.

\(iii\) *Immaculate thousand*: All the songs in this great hymnal are like unto as many sacred waters.
