**Tamil text and transliteration:**

ஓவாத் துயர்ப் பிறவி உட்பட மற்று எவ் எவையும்,  
மூவாத் தனி முதலாய் மூவுலகும் காவலோன்,  
மா ஆகி ஆமை ஆய் மீன் ஆகி மானிடம் ஆம்,  
தேவாதி தேவ பெருமான் என் தீர்த்தனே.

ōvāt tuyarp piṟavi uṭpaṭa maṟṟu ev evaiyum,  
mūvāt taṉi mutalāy mūvulakum kāvalōṉ,  
mā āki āmai āy mīṉ āki māṉiṭam ām,  
tēvāti tēva perumāṉ eṉ tīrttaṉē.

**English translation of verse 2.8.5:**

The Supreme Lord, the causeless cause of the flowing universe,  
Its creation, sustentation and destruction, Chief of the Celestials,  
My Tīrttaṉ (Who sanctified me) did come down as a Horse,  
Tortoise, Fish and Man, and protected the worlds, one and all.

**Note**

The routine of the Universe falling under the three major compartments of creation, preservation and dissolution, goes on uninterruptedly because of the ever-alert and omnipotent Lord who directs and controls them all. No doubt, He dowered on all of us, limbs and sense-organs to put us on a career of gainful activity with a view to attaining Him, but even if we stray away from Him He is such an indefatigable cultivator who doesn’t lose heart when the yield is low or next to nothing, but goes on with His cultivation, hoping for better days. That is why He takes all the trouble to incarnate in various forms and goes on with His work of resuscitation.
