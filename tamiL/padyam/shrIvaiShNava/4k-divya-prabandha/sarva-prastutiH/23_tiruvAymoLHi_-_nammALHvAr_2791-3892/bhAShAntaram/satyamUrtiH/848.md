**Tamil text and transliteration:**

தெளிவுற்று வீவுஇன்றி நின்றவர்க்கு இன்பக்கதிசெய்யும்,  
தெளிவுற்ற கண்ணனைத் தென்குருகூர்ச் சடகோபன்சொல்,  
தெளிவுற்ற ஆயிரத்துள் இவை பத்தும் வல்லார், அவர்  
தெளிவுற்ற சிந்தையர் பாமரு மூவுலகத்துள்ளே (2)

teḷivuṟṟu vīvuiṉṟi niṉṟavarkku iṉpakkaticeyyum,  
teḷivuṟṟa kaṇṇaṉait teṉkurukūrc caṭakōpaṉcol,  
teḷivuṟṟa āyirattuḷ ivai pattum vallār, avar  
teḷivuṟṟa cintaiyar pāmaru mūvulakattuḷḷē (2)

**English translation of verse 7.5.11:**

Those that learn these songs ten  
Out of the lucid thousand composed by Caṭakōpaṉ,  
Of kurukūr, adoring the Lord, who clarity personified is,  
And bestows on His devotees, clear and steadfast, final bliss.  
Will clarity of mind attain even in this land of dismal distress.

**Notes:**

\(i\) *The lucid thousand*: Like unto the turbid water in the river becoming clear and limpid in certain areas, the vedas, confused like the gummy substance in the jack fruit sticking to the straw-like stuff covering the fruit, acquire clarity in the hands of Saint Nammāḻvār.

\(ii\) *The devotees, clear and steadfast*: Devotees with a clear conviction, like that of the Āḻvār, that the Lord is their Sole Refuge, which cannot be shaken. The clarity of knowledge is like that obtained by Arjuna who confessed to his doubts having been dispelled on hearing Lord Kṛṣṇa’s teachings. In this context, it is interesting to recall the following conversation between Nañcīyar and his illustrious disciple, Nampiḷḷai:

*Nampiḷḷai*: “Sire, did Arjuna attain the Lord or not?”

*Nañcīyar*: “It is immaterial whether Arjuna attained God or not and your question is hardly relevant. We have to pin our faith to Gītā as the Lord’s teachings without enquiring who are all the beneficiaries, even as the thirsty quench their thirst by drinking nice, cool water at sight, without caring to ascertain the names of those whose thirst has already been quenched by drinking water”.
