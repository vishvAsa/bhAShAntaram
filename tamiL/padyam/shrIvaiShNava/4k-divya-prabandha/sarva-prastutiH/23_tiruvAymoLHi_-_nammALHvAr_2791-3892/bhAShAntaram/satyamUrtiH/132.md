**Tamil text and transliteration:**

மறப்பும் ஞானமும் நான் ஒன்று உணர்ந்திலன்,  
மறக்கும் என்று செந்தாமரைக் கண்ணொடு,  
மறப்பு அற என் உள்ளே மன்னினான் தன்னை,  
மறப்பனோ? இனி யான் என் மணியையே.

maṟappum ñāṉamum nāṉ oṉṟu uṇarntilaṉ,  
maṟakkum eṉṟu centāmaraik kaṇṇoṭu,  
maṟappu aṟa eṉ uḷḷē maṉṉiṉāṉ taṉṉai,  
maṟappaṉō? iṉi yāṉ eṉ maṇiyaiyē.

**English translation of verse 1.10.10:**

I know not what it is to feel or forget  
And yet, the Lord, with red-lotus-eyes, does apprehend  
That I’ll forget Him and, as one forewarned,  
He has lodged Himself firm in my heart;  
The gem of a Lord, shall I any more forget?

**Notes**

\(i\) The Āḻvār feels that he is incapable of thinking and there is, therefore, no question of his forgetting either. The Lord is, however, anxious that the knowledge now dawned on the Āḻvār as a result of His union with him, should remain intact, leaving ṇo more scope for his sliding down or slipping off. He has, therefore, lodged Himself firmly inside the Āḻvār, casting His benevolent glances on him.

\(ii\) Who will cast away a priceless gem when it comes to one’s hand, instead of treasuring it and enjoying it all the time?
