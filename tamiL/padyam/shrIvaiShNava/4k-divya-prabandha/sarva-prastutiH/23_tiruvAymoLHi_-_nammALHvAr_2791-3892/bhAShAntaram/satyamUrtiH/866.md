**Tamil text and transliteration:**

வாலியதுஓர் கனிகொல் வினையாட்டியேன் வல்வினைகொல்,  
கோலம் திரள்பவளக் கொழும்துண்டம்கொலோ? அறியேன்,  
நீல நெடுமுகில்போல் திருமேனி அம்மான் தொண்டைவாய்,  
ஏலும் திசையுள்எல்லாம் வந்து தோன்றும் என்இன்உயிர்க்கே.

vāliyatuōr kaṉikol viṉaiyāṭṭiyēṉ valviṉaikol,  
kōlam tiraḷpavaḷak koḻumtuṇṭamkolō? aṟiyēṉ,  
nīla neṭumukilpōl tirumēṉi ammāṉ toṇṭaivāy,  
ēlum ticaiyuḷellām vantu tōṉṟum eṉiṉuyirkkē.

**English translation of verse 7.7.3:**

Is this a fruit unique, ever *in tact*, or is it,  
This sinner’s sin tough, that can’t enojoy it right now or is it  
A chip of coral, pretty and delicate, I know not;  
The red lips, fruit-like of the cloud-hued Lord are seen  
In every direction I turn, tormenting my life sweet.

**Notes:**

The Lord’s red lips look like a red fruit which is ever fresh and knows no growth or decay; they also look like a chip of coral. The Nāyakī recognises on a closer look that they are but the lips of the cloud-hued Lord of bluish tint, which she would like to enjoy that very moment, but can’t do so, because of her heavy sins standing in the way. The nectarean lips are indeed oppressive to the Nāyakī, in her present state of frustration, like nectar becoming a veritable poison, in so far as a sinner is concerned, precluding him from enjoying it. Surely, the Lord’s lips would not lag behind His eyes and nose, in exhibiting to the Nāyakī their oppressive charm, making themselves distinctly visible wherever she turns, determined to end her life.
