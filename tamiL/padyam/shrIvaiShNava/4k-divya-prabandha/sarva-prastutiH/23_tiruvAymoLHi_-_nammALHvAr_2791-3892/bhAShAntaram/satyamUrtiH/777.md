**Tamil text and transliteration:**

அடியேன் மேவி அமர்கின்ற அமுதே! இமையோர் அதிபதியே,  
கொடியா அடு புள் உடையானே! கோலக் கனிவாய்ப் பெருமானே,  
செடி ஆர் வினைகள் தீர் மருந்தே! திருவேங்கடத்து எம் பெருமானே,  
நொடி ஆர் பொழுதும் உன பாதம் காண நோலாது ஆற்றேனே

aṭiyēṉ mēvi amarkiṉṟa amutē! imaiyōr atipatiyē,  
koṭiyā aṭu puḷ uṭaiyāṉē! kōlak kaṉivāyp perumāṉē,  
ceṭi ār viṉaikaḷ tīr maruntē! tiruvēṅkaṭattu em perumāṉē,  
noṭi ār poḻutum uṉa pātam kāṇa nōlātu āṟṟēṉē

**English translation of verse 6.10.7:**

You are the Nectar, by this vassal enjoyed, Oh, Lord of Celestials,  
On Your banner is Garuḍa Who the enemies burns out, for dense ills  
You are the panacea, Oh, Lord at Tiruvēṅkaṭam, Your lips attractive  
Like unto lovely fruit, I am eager to behold; I am indeed restive.  
Brooking no delay, not a trice, in worshipping Your feet,  
Although I have to my credit no special rite.

#### Notes

\(i\) It is the insatiable Nectar, deeply imbedded in the mind of the Āḻvār, that he hastens to behold physically. All this flutter, on his part, is not because of any misgiving regarding the attainment of the goal but because of his inability to brook the delay in getting at it, overwhelmed by its grandeur.

\(ii\) ‘*The Nectar by this vassal enjoyed*’, is yet another addition to the long list of the Lord’s holy names, similar to the one coined by the Āḻvār earlier, ‘*The One in me mingled*’, vide II-5-2. The Nectar, enjoyed by the Āḻvār, is indeed far superior to the one said to have been enjoyed by the Devas, a mere salt extract, in comparison to the current enjoyment of the Āḻvār, and, for the matter of that, the Āḻvār’s manner of enjoyment is unique, by-no-means comparable with that of others.

\(iii\) This song (as per the text in the original) is being chanted by the devout while making offerings of dishes to the Lord, as part of worship, as ordained by Śrī Parāśara Bhaṭṭar.
