**Tamil text and transliteration:**

உகந்தேஉன்னை உள்ளும் என்உள்ளத்து அகம்பால்  
அகம்தான் அமர்ந்தே இடம்கொண்ட அமலா  
மிகும்தானவன் மார்வுஅகலம் இருகூறா  
நகந்தாய் நரசிங்கம்அதுஆய உருவே!

ukantēuṉṉai uḷḷum eṉuḷḷattu akampāl  
akamtāṉ amarntē iṭamkoṇṭa amalā  
mikumtāṉavaṉ mārvuakalam irukūṟā  
nakantāy naraciṅkamatuāya uruvē!

**English translation of verse 9.4.7:**

Oh, immaculate Lord, In me seated firm, You remain,  
Your potent nails tore the haughty demon’s broad chest in twain,  
Oh, Naraciṅka, revels indeed the inner core of my heart  
In the enjoyment of You, my Lord, so sweet.

**Notes:**

The Āḻvār feels gratified that the Lord has responded to his call even as He did, in the case of Prahlādā to cater to whose ardent wish, He emerged as Man-Lion, right from inside a pillar and cleaved the haughty Hiraṇya’s body into parts. In his present state of exultation, the Āḻvār drowns all his past miseries due to separation from the Lord, nor is he apprehensive of the dreadful prospect of yet another spell of separation from Him. The present enjoyment is so full and complete that it does not admit of brooding over the past desolation or dreading a gloomy future.
