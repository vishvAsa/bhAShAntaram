**English translation of verse 2.4.3:**

**Tamil text and transliteration:**

இரக்க மனத்தோடு எரி அணை,  
அரக்கும் மெழுகும் ஒக்கும் இவள்,  
இரக்கம் எழீர் இதற்கு என் செய்கேன்,  
அரக்கன் இலங்கை செற்றீருக்கே.

irakka maṉattōṭu eri aṇai,  
arakkum meḻukum okkum ivaḷ,  
irakkam eḻīr itaṟku eṉ ceykēṉ,  
arakkaṉ ilaṅkai ceṟṟīrukkē.

**English translation of verse 2.4.3:**

You, who the demon’s Laṅkā did rout,  
Relent not for this dame of tender heart,  
Who is like unto wax set on fire;  
Oh, what can I do for her?

**Note**

[Mother to the Lord:]

> “What you did to reclaim > Sītā from her > captivity in Laṅkā, how you languished without > food and sleep > days on end, how you bunded the roaring sea and routed > Rāvaṇa’s > Laṅkā, lock, stock and barrel have been chronicled by sage > Vālmīki > in his immortal > Rāmāyaṇa. > And so it is well within the Knowledge of my hapless daughter. > Therefore it is she feels tormented why she couldn’t get a similar > treatment at your hands. Oh, what a contrasting picture! my daughter > of melting tenderness of heart, like the wax come in contact with > fire, and you, absolutely hard-hearted and unrelenting. What can I do, > in between? There is no remedy for this situation except the influx of > your sweet grace. I daresay you who did so much for Sītā, will not lay > yourself open to the charge of cruel partiality and terrible > discrimination by not coming to my daughter’s aid, at once.”
