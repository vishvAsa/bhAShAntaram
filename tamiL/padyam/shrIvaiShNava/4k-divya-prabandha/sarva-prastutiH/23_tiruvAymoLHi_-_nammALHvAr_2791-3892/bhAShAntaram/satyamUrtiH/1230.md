கண்டேன் கமல மலர்ப்பாதம் காண்டலுமே  
விண்டே ஒழிந்த வினையாயின எல்லாம்  
தொண்டேசெய்து என்றும் தொழுது வழியொழுக  
பண்டே பரமன் பணித்த பணிவகையே.

viṇṭē oḻinta viṉaiyāyiṉa ellām  
toṇṭēceytu eṉṟum toḻutu vaḻiyoḻuka  
paṇṭē paramaṉ paṇitta paṇivakaiyē.

**English translation of verse 10.4.9:**

Beheld have I the Lord’s lotus feet and the moment I saw them,  
Root and branch have all my sins been cut out and unto Him  
Deep love in me has been engendered; Him I do adore  
With no break, true to His dictates, as of old.

**Notes:**

The [Āḻvār](/definition/aḻvar#vaishnavism "show Āḻvār definitions") gratefully acknowledges the Lord’s spontaneous grace, which enabled him to behold His lotus feet which are not accessible even to the exalted Celestials in the upper regions, despite rigorous penance for ages. The moment he saw the Lord’s lovely feet, all his accumulated sins of ages got blotted out, *in toto*, true to His promise, “Ahaṃ tvā sarva pāpebhyo mokṣayiṣyāmi” ([Bhagavad Gītā](/definition/bhagavad-gita#vaishnavism "show Bhagavad Gītā definitions") XVIII—66). Although Lord [Kṛṣṇa](/definition/krishna#vaishnavism "show Kṛṣṇa definitions") had said, in His ‘Song Celestial’, no more than this, the Āḻvār, endowed by the Lord himself with spiritual knowledge, full and complete, elucidates the full import of the Lord’s promise in question. He says that the word “Mokṣayiṣyāmi” does not mean mere emancipation from [bondage](/definition/bondage#history "show bondage definitions"), the dreadful cycle of [birth](/definition/birth#history "show birth definitions") and rebirth, but eternal service unto the Lord, as well, in keeping with the subject’s essential [nature](/definition/nature#history "show nature definitions"), as the Lord’s exclusive vassal.
