**English translation of verse 9.2.8:**

Oh, Lord, You repose in Tiruppuḷiṅkuṭi whose castles tall  
Soar right up to the Moon, in Tiruvaikuṇṭam You keep standing.  
May You right here remain [seated](/definition/seat#history "show seated definitions"), in front of us all,  
For a day at least, for the worldly men to pray in tones resounding  
And prostrate with love intensified, vying with each other.

**Notes:**

\(i\) The Lord is known to remain seated in the Durbar hall in the high [Heavens](/definition/heaven#history "show Heavens definitions"), where He grants audience. The

[Āḻvār](/definition/aḻvar#vaishnavism "show Āḻvār definitions") would, however, pray unto the Lord, reclining in Tiruppuḷiṅkuṭi, to appear like-wise, right here, so as to attract the people over here and make them worship Him, to their heart’s fill, in grateful appreciation of His great gesture.

\(ii\) *To pray in tones resounding*:

What really moves the Lord and what He looks for in us, are neither the matter comprised in the hymns we sing in His praise nor even the manner in which we sing them but cordiality and humility in our hearts. Whereas the high class brahmins, swelling with [pride](/definition/pride#history "show pride definitions") over their stature and [learning](/definition/learning#history "show learning definitions"), address the Deity, in their usual accents, high-sounding Sankrit phrases, “Victory unto You” and so on, the so-called low class people praise the Lord, in their simple, unsophisticated, rustic tongue, as follows:

“Dear Lord, do Thou drink milk! do Thou eat Fruit! do Thou wear warm clothes!” and so on.
