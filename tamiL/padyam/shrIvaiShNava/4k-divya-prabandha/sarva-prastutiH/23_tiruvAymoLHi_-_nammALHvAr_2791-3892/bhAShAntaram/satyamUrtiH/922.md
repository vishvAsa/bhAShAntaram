**Tamil text and transliteration:**

ஆர்உயிரேயோ அகல்இடம்முழுதும் படைத்துஇடந்து உண்டு உமிழ்ந்துஅளந்த  
பேர்உயிரேயோ பெரியநீர் படைத்து அங்கு உறைந்து அது கடைந்துஅடைத்து உடைத்த  
சீர்உயிரேயோ மனிசர்க்குத்தேவர் போலத் தேவர்க்கும்தேவாவோ  
ஓர்உயிரேயோ உலகங்கட்கு எல்லாம் உன்னை நான் எங்கு வந்து உறுகோ?

**English translation of verse 8.1.5:**

You are my life dear, oh Lord! You did create  
The spacious worlds, one and all, pulled them out  
From beneath the waters deep, during the deluge ate  
And later spat them out, the Supreme Lord that You are,  
You spanned the worlds, reposed on the vast sheet of water,  
Churned the ocean once, then bunded it and broke the bund later;  
Could You unto Devas be what they are unto men, oh, great One,  
You, the unique Soul of all the worlds, where shall I attain?

**Notes:**

\(i\) In the preceding song, the Āḻvār would appear to have provoked the Lord into questioning him, how one, so ill-equipped as he, could think of attaining Him and on the top of that, doubt His greatness and bonafides. The Āḻvār’s answer is that he is but the body and the Lord, the life within, whose bounden duty it is to take care of him. There was hardly any question of the body pursuing a path of its own, by way of practising austerity, discipline etc. Actually, it was He who did, from time to time, all that had to be done, by way of creating the worlds, sustaining them within His stomach during the deluge, refunding them later on to their former sistuations [situations?], rescuing the worlds from Mahā Bali, the usurper, by spanning them all, in just three strides, so on and so forth. And then, He lay on the ocean where came the Divine Mother through His churning; He also bunded the ocean to cross over to Laṇkā, to get at the Mother and later demolished the bund, so as to prevent the entry of the Rākṣasas into the mainland.

\(ii\) The humans could subsist on mere food and water while the Devas need ‘Amrut ’ (ambrosia) for their subsistence. If this marks the distance between the mortals and the immortal Devas, well, there is not only that much distance but very much more between the Devas and the Supreme Lord, the ‘Devādi Deva’ and the comparison is thus not on all fours. While the ratio between Man and Deva is a definite quantum, that between the Deva and the Lord would baffle even the wildest imagination and cannot be put in finite terms.
