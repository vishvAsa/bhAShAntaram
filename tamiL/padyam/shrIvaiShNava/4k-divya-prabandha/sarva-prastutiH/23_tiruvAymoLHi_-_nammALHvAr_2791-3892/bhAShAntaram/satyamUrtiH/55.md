**[Tamil](/definition/tamil#history "show Tamil definitions") text and transliteration:**

அளவு இயன்ற ஏழ் உலகத்தவர் பெருமான் கண்ணனை  
வள வயல் சூழ் வண் குருகூர்ச் சடகோபன் வாய்ந்து உரைத்த  
அளவு இயன்ற அந்தாதி ஆயிரத்துள் இப் பத்தின்  
வள உரையால் பெறலாகும் வான் ஓங்கு பெரு வளமே. (2)

aḷavu iyaṉṟa antāti āyirattuḷ ip pattiṉ

**English translation of verse 1.4.11:**

Those that just recite these sweet songs ten  
Out of the metrically perfect thousand, lovingly composed by Caṭakōpaṉ,  
Chief of [rich](/definition/rich#history "show rich definitions") and fertile [Kurukūr](/definition/kurukur#vaishnavism "show Kurukūr definitions"), in adoration  
Of Kaṇṇaṉ, Lord of the denizens of the worlds seven,  
Will attain the Supreme bliss of service in [Heaven](/definition/heaven#history "show Heaven definitions").

**Notes**

\(i\) In the preceding decad, expatiating on the Supreme Lord’s easy accessibility, the Saint wanted to abide in the proximate [Kṛṣṇa](/definition/krishna#vaishnavism "show Kṛṣṇa definitions") [avatāra](/definition/avatara#vaishnavism "show avatāra definitions") but failure to achieve it led him to send errands to the Lord in this decad. Having seen the intensity of the love of Parāṅkuśa Nāyakī and her yearning for Divine presence, too deep for words, as revealed in the preceding ten stanzas, the Lord could not stay back any longer, except at the risk of the [Āḻvār](/definition/aḻvar#vaishnavism "show Āḻvār definitions") being lost to this world altogether. The fact that the Lord has been restored to the Saint can be inferred from the very tenor of this stanza, where the Lord is being extolled as the Chief of all the worlds, thus presenting His overlordship and easy-accessibility, side by side.

\(ii\) Even the mere recital of the text of these stanzas, without so much as delving into their spirit and meaning, will, it is claimed, shoot one up, from the bottom-most depths of worldly existence to the highest state of Service unto the Lord in the High [Heavens](/definition/heaven#history "show Heavens definitions").
