**[Tamil](/definition/tamil#history "show Tamil definitions") text and transliteration:**

காத்த எம்கூத்தாவோ! மலைஏந்திக் கல்மாரி தன்னை,  
பூத்தண் துழாய்முடியாய்! புனை கொன்றையஞ் செஞ்சடையாய்,  
வாய்த்த என் நான்முகனே! வந்துஎன் ஆர்உயிர் நீஆனால்,  
ஏத்துஅரும் கீர்த்தியினாய்! உன்னை எங்குத் தலைப்பெய்வனே?

kātta emkūttāvō! malaiēntik kalmāri taṉṉai,  
pūttaṇ tuḻāymuṭiyāy! puṉai koṉṟaiyañ ceñcaṭaiyāy,  
vāytta eṉ nāṉmukaṉē! vantueṉ āruyir nīāṉāl,  
ēttuarum kīrttiyiṉāy! uṉṉai eṅkut talaippeyvaṉē?

**English translation of verse 7.6.3:**

Oh, You Dancer great, aloft You held the mountain  
And beat off the hail [storm](/definition/storm#history "show storm definitions"), on Your crown is tuḷaci, cool and nice,  
Oh, Internal Controller of [Śiva](/definition/shiva#vaishnavism "show Śiva definitions") and [Brahmā](/definition/brahma#vaishnavism "show Brahmā definitions")! Your glory description defies,  
You are my Soul dear, me, you do, on your own, sustain  
And Yet I know not where You I shall attain?

**Notes:**

\(i\) [Indra](/definition/indra#vaishnavism "show Indra definitions") visited his fury in the shape of a hail storm, raining stones and Lord [Kṛṣṇa](/definition/krishna#vaishnavism "show Kṛṣṇa definitions") warded it off by holding mount Govardhan aloft like an umbrella. As Nampiḷḷai puts it in his unique way, the Lord would have lifted the ocean itself instead of the mountain and shielded the subjects, had Indra sent down watery rain instead of the stony one! The [Āḻvār](/definition/aḻvar#vaishnavism "show Āḻvār definitions") now asks whether the Lord will shield only a whole [township](/definition/township#history "show township definitions") and that against the fury of the elements instead of a single individual like him, pelted by the rain of sorrow, visited on him by his very existence in this world. Actually, his affliction is much more intense than the combined intensity of the sufferings of a whole township. And yet, the Āḻvār does not want the Lord to lift yet another mountain for his sake but pines only for the sight of the sinewy arms of the Lord, the lifter of Govardhan.

\(ii\) Says the Āḻvār “Oh, Lord, You are the Soul iunto me, Your body. Where is the question of the body attaining the Soul? As one exclusively dependent on You, I know of no Means but You, to attain you. Does it not follow, therefore, that You have to pick me up?”
