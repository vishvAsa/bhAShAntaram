**Tamil text and transliteration:**

சூழ்விசும் பணிமுகில் தூரியம் முழக்கின  
ஆழ்கடல் அலைதிரைக் கைஎடுத்து ஆடின  
ஏழ்பொழிலும் வளம்ஏந்திய என்அப்பன்  
வாழ்புகழ் நாரணன் தமரைக் கண்டுஉகந்தே. (2)

cūḻvicum paṇimukil tūriyam muḻakkiṉa  
āḻkaṭal alaitiraik kaieṭuttu āṭiṉa  
ēḻpoḻilum vaḷamēntiya eṉappaṉ  
vāḻpukaḻ nāraṇaṉ tamaraik kaṇṭuukantē. (2)

**English translation of verse 10.9.1:**

The comely clouds in the sprawling sky did music roar,  
The surging waves of the deep seas danced with joy, gifts rare,  
The inhabitants of the islands seven did in their hands bear,  
To greet with great joy, the on-coming devotees of my Sire  
The beneficent Nāraṇaṉ of undying fame.

**Notes:**

\(i\) This song describes the ecstatic manner in which even the inanimate clouds, which decorate the sprawling sky and the surging waves of the deep seas, came forward to greet the devotees of Lord Śrīman Nārāyaṇa of undying fame, during their ascent to the high Heavens. All the seven islands wore a festive appearance and their inhabitants, one and all, held, in their hands, their choicest gifts to be offered to these Heaven-bound souls.

\(ii\) What a grand poetic imagery! When the clouds sang, the waves of the seas danced in accompaniment. It was all spontaneous, not made to order. When the Prince moves round, it is but meet that all those owing allegiance to the king should gieet the royal visitor.
