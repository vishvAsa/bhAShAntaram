**[Tamil](/definition/tamil#history "show Tamil definitions") text and transliteration:**

விட்டு இலங்கு செஞ்சோதித் தாமரை பாதம் கைகள் கண்கள,  
விட்டு இலங்கு கருஞ்சுடர் மலையே திரு உடம்பு,  
விட்டு இலங்கு மதியம் சீர் சங்கு சக்கரம் பரிதி,  
விட்டு இலங்கு முடி அம்மான் மதுசூதனன் தனக்கே.

viṭṭu ilaṅku ceñcōtit tāmarai pātam kaikaḷ kaṇkaḷa,  
viṭṭu ilaṅku karuñcuṭar malaiyē [tiru](/definition/tiru#history "show tiru definitions") uṭampu,  
viṭṭu ilaṅku matiyam cīr caṅku cakkaram pariti,  
viṭṭu ilaṅku muṭi ammāṉ matucūtaṉaṉ taṉakkē.

**English translation of verse 2.7.5:**

Sporting the majestic crown, exceedingly bright,  
My lord, Matucūtaṉ’s eyes, hands and feet are very smart.  
Like the lotus, red and broad; His body like blue mount Shines,  
His Conch is like the Moon bright and His discus, a veritable Sun.

**Note**

Tirumāḻai Āṇṭāṉ told Rāmānuja that this song reveals how the [Āḻvār](/definition/aḻvar#vaishnavism "show Āḻvār definitions") was attracted to the Lord through the display of His exquisite personal charms and ascribed this interpretation to his Master, Śrī [Āḷavantār](/definition/alavantar#vaishnavism "show Āḷavantār definitions") (Yāmuṉa) Śrī Rāmānuja was unusually quiet and when asked by the Instructor whether he had nothing to say against, as he very often did, Śrī Rāmānuja signified his approval through his broad, bewitching smile. But Śrī [Parāśara](/definition/parashara#history "show Parāśara definitions") Bhaṭṭar would put it differently and say, “The song reveals the extra brilliance displayed by the Lord’s person after making the Āḻvār and his associates His own”. Whereas the former interpretation makes the Lord’s personal charms the cause or instrument for wearing away the Āḻvār and bringing him into the Lord’s fold, the latter shows it as the effect, the result of bringing the Āḻvār and his association unto the Lord's fold.
