**[Tamil](/definition/tamil#history "show Tamil definitions") text and transliteration:**

பற்று இலன் ஈசனும் முற்றவும் நின்றனன்  
பற்று இலையாய் அவன் முற்றில் அடங்கே.

paṟṟu ilaṉ īcaṉum muṟṟavum niṉṟaṉaṉ  
paṟṟu ilaiyāy avaṉ muṟṟil aṭaṅkē.

**English translation of verse 1.2.6:**

*Īcaṉ* (the Supreme Lord), being solely attached to His devotees, He is ‘All-in-One’ (everything) unto them. And so, [ye worldlings]! hold on to Him and get absorbed in serving Him exclusively.

**Note**

Thinking that the worldlings (whom the [Āḻvār](/definition/aḻvar#vaishnavism "show Āḻvār definitions") addresses) might have their own misgivings about the easy accessibility of the Supreme Lord, Whom they are being asked to court and venerate, the [doubt](/definition/doubt#history "show doubt definitions") is being cleared in this stanza. Side by side with overlordship there is in Him the astounding quality of amazing simplicity, which predominates and makes it appear that this is His natural trait, and the other quality of Supremacy is super-imposed, rather serving as a foil against which the former shines all the more.
