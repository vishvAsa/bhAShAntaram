**Tamil text and transliteration:**

பணிமொழி நினைதொறும் ஆவி வேமால் பகல்நிரை மேய்க்கிய போய கண்ணா!  
பிணிஅவிழ் மல்லிகை வாடை தூவ பெருமத மாலையும் வந்தின்று ஆலோ!  
மணிமிகு மார்பினில் முல்லைப் போது என்வனமுலை கமழ்வித்து உன் வாய் அமுதம் தந்து  
அணிமிகு தாமரைக் கையை அந்தோ! அடிச்சியோம் தலைமிசை நீஅணியாய்

paṇimoḻi niṉaitoṟum āvi vēmāl pakalnirai mēykkiya pōya kaṇṇā!  
piṇiaviḻ mallikai vāṭai tūva perumata mālaiyum vantiṉṟu ālō!  
maṇimiku mārpiṉil mullaip pōtu eṉvaṉamulai kamaḻvittu uṉ vāy amutam tantu  
aṇimiku tāmaraik kaiyai antō! aṭicciyōm talaimicai nīaṇiyāy

**English translation of verse 10.3.5:**

Your soothing words put our hearts in jitters  
As we recollect them Oh, Kaṇṇā, You did the cows go after  
The whole day; the evening has arrived with gusto great  
And it does the fragrance of Jasmine, in full bloom, waft,  
Let my comely breasts enjoy the lavender scent on Your winsome chest  
And my lips the nectar from yours, put Your lovely lotus hand  
On our lowly heads and affirm, the cows You’d no more tend.

**Notes:**

Even when Kṛṣṇa is by their side, the Gopis say that He has gone already to the grazing meadow. What is even worse, they fancy that He has teen away from them for a whole day and it is evening already, with its characteristic environments. In their exuberance of love, they find what actually is the early morn, transposed into the evening with the chill breeze, laden with the fragrance of the jasmine. No wonder, they now pass through all those pangs experienced by them, in IX-9 ante. The sudden appearance of the evening breeze, cruel and tormenting, is likened to Rāvaṇa, come in the disguise of a hermit, before Sītā at Pañcavaṭi-Finding the Gopi in such a plight, Lord Kṛṣṇa asks her what exactly He should do by her and her reply is, as in the last three lines of this song. Śrī Kūrattāḻvāṉ’s “Manmūrti hantha! karapallava thallajamte Kurvan Kathā Kṛtamanoratayiṣyase mām”, in his “Śrīvaikuṇṭa Sthava”, is the exact reproduction of “put your lovely lotus hands on our lowly heads”, occurring in this song.
