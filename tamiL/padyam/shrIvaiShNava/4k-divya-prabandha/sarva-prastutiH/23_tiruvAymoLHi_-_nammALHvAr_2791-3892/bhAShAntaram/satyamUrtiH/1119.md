**[Tamil](/definition/tamil#history "show Tamil definitions") text and transliteration:**

அறிகிலேன் தன்னுள் அனைத்துஉலகும் நிற்க  
நெறிமையால் தானும் அவற்றுள் நிற்கும் பிரான்  
வெறிகமழ்சோலைத் தென்காட்கரை என்அப்பன்  
சிறியவென்னாயிருண்ட திருஅருளே.

aṟikilēṉ taṉṉuḷ aṉaittuulakum niṟka  
neṟimaiyāl tāṉum avaṟṟuḷ niṟkum pirāṉ  
veṟikamaḻcōlait teṉkāṭkarai eṉappaṉ  
ciṟiyaveṉṉāyiruṇṭa tiruaruḷē.

**English translation of verse 9.6.4:**

The Lord Supreme does all things and beings sustain  
And in them all abides; it is beyond me to ascertain  
Why my Sire dwelling in Teṉkāṭkarai, amid fragrant gardens,  
Should on this petty soul deign to lavish His affections.

**Notes:**

It is indeed incredible that the Lord, higher than whom there is none, should pounce upon a frail being like the [Āḻvār](/definition/aḻvar#vaishnavism "show Āḻvār definitions"), with such avidity. As Nampiḷḷai would put it, the Āḻvār is at a loss to know whether the Lord did so out of love or He was out to kill him with His overwhelming kindness. The Lord just grabbed at the Āḻvār, saying that the latter, in his native humility, was not conscious of his greatness.
