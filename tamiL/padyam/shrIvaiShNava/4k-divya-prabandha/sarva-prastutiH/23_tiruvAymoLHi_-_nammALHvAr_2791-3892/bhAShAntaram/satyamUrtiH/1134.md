தூதுஉரைத்தல் செப்புமின்கள் தூமொழிவாய் வண்டுஇனங்காள்  
போதுஇரைத்து மதுநுகரும் பொழில் மூழிக்களத்துஉறையும்  
மாதரைத்தம் மார்வகத்தே வைத்தார்க்கு என்வாய்மாற்றம்  
தூதுஉரைத்தல் செப்புதிரேல் சுடர்வளையும் கலையுமே.

tūtuuraittal ceppumiṉkaḷ tūmoḻivāy vaṇṭuiṉaṅkāḷ  
pōtuiraittu matunukarum poḻil mūḻikkaḷattuuṟaiyum  
mātaraittam mārvakattē vaittārkku eṉvāymāṟṟam  
tūtuuraittal cepputirēl cuṭarvaḷaiyum kalaiyumē.

**English translation of verse 9.7.6:**

Ye, sweet-sounding bees, if you would unto my Lord fly down,  
Who the Divine Mother bears on His winsome chest and goes gay,  
Residing in Tirumūḻikkaḷam, full of flower gardens,  
Shedding honey in plenty and unto Him my oral message convey,  
My [saree](/definition/saree#history "show saree definitions") and bangles I shall indeed regain.

**Notes:**

\(i\) The *Sweet-sounding* bees typify the [Ācāryas](/definition/acarya#vaishnavism "show Ācāryas definitions") who can win over the Lord through their *persuasive eloquence*.

\(ii\) The Nāyakī does not even want the bees to come back and tell her what the Lord has to say in reply to her message. It would indeed be sufficient if they just conveyed her message to the Lord who is her avowed Saviour, pledged to protect her. What is even more assuring to the Nāyakī is the effective intercession and purposeful pleading of Śrī [Mahālakṣmī](/definition/mahalakshmi#vaishnavism "show Mahālakṣmī definitions"), on behalf of the Nāyakī. All that the bees have got to do is to go to Tirumūḻik-kaḻam, where the flower gardens yield plenty of [food](/definition/food#history "show food definitions") (honey) for them and incidentally tell the Lord about her in the immediate presence of [Lakṣmī](/definition/lakshmi#vaishnavism "show Lakṣmī definitions"). In that propitious setting, the Nāyakī is quite sanguine of the result, namely, the restoration of the Lord to her and that would mean, she will, once again, don her saree all right and the bangles will also rest well on her wrist.
