**Tamil text and transliteration:**

கலந்து என் ஆவி, நலம்கொள்நாதன்,  
புலன் கொள் மாணாய், நிலம்கொண்டானே.

kalantu eṉ āvi, nalamkoḷnātaṉ,  
pulaṉ koḷ māṇāy, nilamkoṇṭāṉē.

**English translation of verse 1.8.6:**

The Lord Who uṇto me adhered  
And did my Soul make good  
Took, as a Midget (Vāmaṉa) of enthralling form,  
Land (of three strides) as alms.

**Note**

As dwarfish Vāmaṉa of bewitching personality, He enticed away Emperor Bali and made all his possessions, His own; likewise, mixing now with the Āḻvār, the Lord has taken possession of his soul and made him His sole servitor, in keeping with his essential nature.
