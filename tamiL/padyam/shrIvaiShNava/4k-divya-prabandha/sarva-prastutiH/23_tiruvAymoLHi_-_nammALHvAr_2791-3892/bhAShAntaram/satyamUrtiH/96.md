In this decad, the [Āḻvār](/definition/aḻvar#vaishnavism "show Āḻvār definitions") brings to the fore the Lord’s quality of ‘Uprightness’ (*ārjava* or *rujuḥ*), His transparence in word, deed and thought, free from sophistry, duplicity, mental reservation, mischievous distortion etc. The Lord would not mean one thing, say another and do a third thing. When [Sūrpaṇakhā](/definition/shurpanakha#vaishnavism "show Sūrpaṇakhā definitions") saw [Śrī Rāma](/definition/shrirama#history "show Śrī Rāma definitions") at [Pañcavaṭi](/definition/pancavati#history "show Pañcavaṭi definitions") and interrogated Him about His personal history, there would have been nothing wrong if He had tactfully withheld the truth from the demoness. But it was not in His grain to do so and hence He gave out the actual fact with remarkable sincerity.

Tirukkurukaippirāṉ Piḷḷāṉ, the earliest glossator on ‘[Tiruvāymoḻi](/definition/tiruvaymoli#vaishnavism "show Tiruvāymoḻi definitions"),’ holds that this decad highlights the Lord’s wealth (*[Aiśvarya](/definition/aishvarya#vaishnavism "show Aiśvarya definitions")*). The other commentators, Periyavāccāṉ Piḷḷai and Vaṭakku Tiruvīti Piḷḷai, however, prefer to bring into focus the Lord’s ‘*ārjava*’ in this decad, as stated at the outset.
