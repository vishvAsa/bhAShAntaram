**Tamil text and transliteration:**

நாதன்ஞாலம்கொள் பாதன், என்னம்மான்,  
ஓதம்போல்கிளர், வேதநீரனே.

nātaṉñālamkoḷ pātaṉ, eṉṉammāṉ,  
ōtampōlkiḷar, vētanīraṉē.

**English translation of verse 1.8.10:**

The Sovereign Master (of the whole universe) whose feet  
Measured all the worlds is my Sire upright fit, indeed  
For the Vedas (vociferous like the ocean) to talk about.

**Note**

The Āḻvār, who was all along maintaining that the Supreme Lord’s numerous incarnations were all for his sake, now says: “Who am I to voice forth the loving tenderness of the Lord, His uprightness which induced Him to incarnate so many times and iṇ so many ways? None is more competent to talk about Him Who, as Tṛivikrama, set His feet on one and all without distinction of high and low, than the Vedas, vociferous like the oceanic waters, in singing His glorious traits”.
