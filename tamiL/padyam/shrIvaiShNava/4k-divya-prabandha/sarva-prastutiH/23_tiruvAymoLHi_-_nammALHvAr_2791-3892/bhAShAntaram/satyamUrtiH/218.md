**Tamil text and transliteration:**

மாதவன் என்றதே கொண்டு என்னை இனி இப்பால் பட்டது,  
யாது அவங்களும் சேர்கொடேன் என்று என்னுள் புகுந்து இருந்து,  
தீது அவம் கெடுக்கும் அமுதம் செந்தாமரைக் கண் குன்றம்,  
கோது அவம் இல் என் கன்னல் கட்டி எம்மான் என் கோவிந்தனே.

mātavaṉ eṉṟatē koṇṭu eṉṉai iṉi ippāl paṭṭatu,  
yātu avaṅkaḷum cērkoṭēṉ eṉṟu eṉṉuḷ pukuntu iruntu,  
tītu avam keṭukkum amutam centāmaraik kaṇ kuṉṟam,  
kōtu avam il eṉ kaṉṉal kaṭṭi emmāṉ eṉ kōvintaṉē.

**English translation of verse 2.7.3:**

‘Mātavaṉ’ is a name by me casually uttered,  
And yet, Kōvintaṉ my Lord, has inside me entered,  
Ridding me of evils, one and all, the lotus-eyed Lord,  
My nectar, Candy flawless, stands like a rock (firm and solid).

**Notes**

\(i\) ‘Madhava’ is the Lord’s name, most intimately associated with the Mother, Lakṣmī, meaning the ‘Consort of Mā’ and, for this reason, most endearing to Him. Śrī Parāśara Bhaṭṭar tells Goddess Raṅganāyakī, enshrined in Śrīraṅgam, that the Lord is dear to the devotees because of Her association with Him (śloka 51 of Śrī guṇaratnakośam [Guṇaratnakośa])

In aphorism 111 of ‘Ācārya Hṛdayam’, the learned author high-lights the Lord’s extra-liberal standards by which He gives us credit for what is known as ‘*ajñāta sukṛta*’ (hidden or unknown merit), such as a casual mention of the word ‘Madhava’ by some one, being treated by the Lord as a pious recital of His name; a mechanical naming of the sacred mountain in the South, known as ‘Tirumāliruñcōḷai malai, as devout remembrance of the sacred pilgrim centre and so on.

\(ii\) Having eradicated all the sins of the Āḻvār, root and branch, the Lord is jubilant, a fact reflected in His effulgent Person. The Lord is free from the twin flaws of (ḷ) expecting anything in return from His beneficiaries and (2) doing good to the devotees for their sake instead of for His own benefit. The candy which we know of, is exposed to two kinds of flaws, namely, use of faulty ingredients and faulty preparation. But the Lord is a flawless candy, which attracted the Āḻvār and kept him wholly absorbed in it.

\(iii\) ‘*Govinda, my Lord*’—The Āḻvār thinks that the Lord incarnated as Kṛṣṇa, (Govinda), only to enthrall him.
