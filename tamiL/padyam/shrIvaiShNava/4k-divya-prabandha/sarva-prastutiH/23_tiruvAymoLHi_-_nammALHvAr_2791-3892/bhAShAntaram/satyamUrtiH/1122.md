**Tamil text and transliteration:**

காட்கரைஏத்தும் அதனுள் கண்ணாஎன்னும்  
வேட்கை நோய்கூர நினைந்து கரைந்துகும்  
ஆட்கொள் வான்ஒத்து என்னுயிருண்ட மாயனால்  
கோள்குறைபட்டது என்னாருயிர் கோள்உண்டே.

kāṭkaraiēttum ataṉuḷ kaṇṇāeṉṉum  
vēṭkai nōykūra niṉaintu karaintukum  
āṭkoḷ vāṉottu eṉṉuyiruṇṭa māyaṉāl  
kōḷkuṟaipaṭṭatu eṉṉāruyir kōḷuṇṭē.

**English translation of verse 9.6.7:**

The wondrous Lord did my soul consume  
After getting inside me, as if to make me His vassal,  
And yet, what little remains of my soul does proclaim  
The glory of Kāṭkarai and calls Him that therein dwells,  
Oh, my Lord Kaṇṇā, love-sick, my soul dwindles  
Recounting His ravishing love during our erstwhile union.

**Notes:**

Consumed by God-love, the Āḻvār feels that he has been fully consumed by God. Still, he keeps pining for Him and the pilgrim centre where He stands enshrined and this shows that a little bit of his partly eaten-up soul is still lingering. Wonder-struck and overwhelmed indeed is the Āḻvār, that the Omniscient Lord should dote on a frail being, like him, in this manner.
