**[Tamil](/definition/tamil#history "show Tamil definitions") text and transliteration:**

நின்றுநின்று பல நாள் உய்க்கும் இவ் உடல் நீங்கிப்போய்,  
சென்று சென்று ஆகிலும் கண்டு சன்மம் கழிப்பான் எண்ணி,  
ஒன்றிஒன்றி உலகம் படைத்தான் கவி ஆயினேற்கு,  
என்றும் என்றும் இனி மற்றொருவர் கவி ஏற்குமே?

**English translation of verse 3.9.10:**

Would it be appropriate if I, the poet of the zealous Lord  
Who with the creation of the worlds goes on, full of hopes  
That His subjects will some day (sooner or later) give up  
The age-long shackles of the material body and attain Him,  
[Sang](/definition/sang#history "show Sang definitions") the glory of any one else, any more?

**Notes**

\(i\) At a time when the individual soul was lying defunct, just as inert as the non-sentient matter, devoid of the capacity to lament or enjoy, it was the Lord’s boundless grace that put the Souls back on their feet, by endowing them with body, limbsand sense-organs, foreking out their progress. Against this background, the [Āḻvār](/definition/aḻvar#vaishnavism "show Āḻvār definitions") queries how the limbs, designed for the Lord’s service, can be put to any other use.

\(ii\) In the ancient farm of ‘Saṃsārā’, the Lord, as an indefatigable and time-honoured Cultivator, has been [raising](/definition/raising#history "show raising definitions") [crop](/definition/crop#history "show crop definitions") after crop (world after world) hoping for a richer harvest of ‘[Bhakti](/definition/bhakti#vaishnavism "show Bhakti definitions")’ (devotion) every time. There are four different routes taken by the Souls when they depart from the material bodies, namely, (1) garbhagathi, (2) yāmyagathi, (3) Dhūmagathi and (4) Arcirādi [gathi](/definition/gathin#history "show gathi definitions"). Although the Lord looks forward to the subjects attaining Him through the last-mentioned ascent of ‘Arcirādi gathi’, they ate mostly moving away from Him, through the other routes. But that does not deter Him and He gets on with His work of creation, hoping for better results, some day, sooner or later. The Āḻvār says that the Lord’s unremitting [labour](/definition/labour#history "show labour definitions") has yielded the desired fruit, at least in his case, inasmuch as he has become the Lord’s poet, [singing](/definition/singing#history "show singing definitions") exclusively His glory.
