**Tamil text and transliteration:**

எழுமைக்கும் எனது ஆவிக்கு இன்அமுதத்தினை எனது ஆர் உயிர்,  
கெழுமிய கதிர்ச் சோதியை மணிவண்ணனை குடக் கூத்தனை,  
விழுமிய அமரர் முனிவர் விழுங்கும் கன்னல் கனியினை,  
தொழுமின் தூய மனத்தர் ஆய் இறையும் நில்லா துயரங்களே.

eḻumaikkum eṉatu āvikku iṉamutattiṉai eṉatu ār uyir,  
keḻumiya katirc cōtiyai maṇivaṇṇaṉai kuṭak kūttaṉai,  
viḻumiya amarar muṉivar viḻuṅkum kaṉṉal kaṉiyiṉai,  
toḻumiṉ tūya maṉattar āy iṟaiyum nillā tuyaraṅkaḷē.

**English translation of verse 3.6.7:**

If, with a mind clean, you worship the Lord,  
The candy fruit, by Sages and Devas devoured,  
My soul’s eternal nectar, of sapphire hue, the beacon-light in my dear soul, absorbed,  
The pot-dancer, You will from miseries be completely absolved.

**Notes**

\(i\) The Āḻvār exhorts his listeners to shake off their fear of an unapproachable, distant Lord, by emphasising His easy-accessibility and enormous love for His devotees. There was indeed a time, when he too was afraid of mingling with the Lord, lest he should defile Him, but now, freed from such a complex, he is in grand communion with the Lord and his tempo goes up all the time beaming with God-love.

\(ii\) The cleanliness of mind, referred to here, is freedom from doubt and despair, fear and fright, in the matter of worshipping the highly adorable Lord of loving condescension, which tend to lead one astray into the domain of sensual pleasures. Shorn of all such doubts and fears, the Āḻvār exhorts people to attach themselves solely to the Lord seeking no personal gains, and thus get absolved of all their sins.
