**Tamil text and transliteration:**

சூது நான் அறியாவகை சுழற்றி ஓர் ஐவரைக் காட்டி உன் அடிப்போது-  
நான் அணுகாவகை செய்து போதிகண்டாய்,  
யாதும் யாவரும் இன்றி நின் அகம்பால் ஒடுக்கி ஓர் ஆலின் நீள் இலை,  
மீது சேர் குழவி! வினையேன் வினைதீர் மருந்தே!

cūtu nāṉ aṟiyāvakai cuḻaṟṟi ōr aivaraik kāṭṭi uṉ aṭippōtu-  
nāṉ aṇukāvakai ceytu pōtikaṇṭāy,  
yātum yāvarum iṉṟi niṉ akampāl oṭukki ōr āliṉ nīḷ ilai,  
mītu cēr kuḻavi! viṉaiyēṉ viṉaitīr maruntē!

**English translation of verse 7.1.4:**

As a mere Babe, You lay on a tender, fig-leaf, oh, Lord,  
And did in a corner of Your stomach all things and beings hold;  
You are the drug that cures the ills of this sinner  
And yet confounding me, You did put me into the snare;  
Of the senses five, on the sly, keeping me very far  
From Your lotus feet, invisible and far off that You are.

**Notes:**

The Āḻvār bitterly complains that:

\(i\) The Lord, who had weaned him away from the mischief of the senses and cured him of all his sins, has now exposed him to the serious risk of slipping back to his old ways;

\(ii\) The Lord has bewildered the Āḻvār who was looking upon His feet as the Sole Refuge, by bringing him once again under the cruel spell of the five senses and

\(iii\) The Lord has kept aloof from him, lest He should have to shed His grace on him, in case He stood beside him; as a matter of fact, he would have put up with any amount of torture by the senses, if only the Lord could be visualised by him, all the time.
