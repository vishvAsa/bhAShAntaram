**Tamil text and transliteration:**

புனைஇழைகள் அணிவும் ஆடைஉடையும் புதுக்கணிப்பும்  
நினையும் நீர்மையதுஅன்று இவட்குஇது நின்று நினைக்கப்புக்கால்  
சுனையினுள் தடம்தாமரை மலரும் தண் திருப்புலியூர்  
முனைவன் மூவுலகுஆளி அப்பன் திருஅருள் மூழ்கினளே.

**English translation of verse 8.9.5:**

The way this lady bedecks herself and dresses up  
And the amorous glow on her if one pauses to look up,  
One can discern,’ tis beyond comprehension [in terms earthly],  
Bathed she must have been in the grace lovely,  
Of the Sovereign Master of all the worlds, reigning supreme  
In cool Tiruppuliyūr in whose ponds lotus flowers are in full bloom.

**Notes:**

The mate is gradually getting into the thick of the subject, by way of adducing incontrovertible evidence of the Nāyakī’s involvement with the Deity at Tiruppuliyūr, in order to convince the Nāyakḻ’s mother, still bent upon binding her daughter to the earthly home and heart'. The mate’s initial suspicion about the Nāyakī’s intimacy with the Deity at Tiruppuliyūr gets confirmed on three counts, namely, (i) the manner in which the jewels are worn by the Nāyakī at present, differs from that in which they were worn before, revealing the fact of their having been interferred with by some one else, removed and put back on her person; (2) her clothes also bear evidence of similar interference, and (3) the wholesome change in her complexion and comportment like unto the parched-up-land getting flushed with a copious supply of water, turning it lush and green. These are, as the mate puts it to the Nāyakī’s mother, unmistakable indications of the Nāyakī’s love affair with the Lord, which the mother should also take due note of. It is indeed impossible to reclaim the Nāyakī, drowned in the ocean of the Lord’s grace.
