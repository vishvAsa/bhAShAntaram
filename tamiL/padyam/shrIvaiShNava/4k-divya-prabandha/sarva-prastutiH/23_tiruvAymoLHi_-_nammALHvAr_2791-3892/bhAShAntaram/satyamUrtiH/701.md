**Tamil text and transliteration:**

கலக்க ஏழ் கடல் ஏழ் மலை உலகு ஏழும் கழியக் கடாய்  
உலக்கத் தேர்கொடு சென்ற மாயமும் உட்பட மற்றும் பல,  
வலக்கை ஆழி இடக்கைச் சங்கம் இவை உடை மால்வண்ணனை,  
மலக்கும் நா உடையேற்கு மாறு உளதோ இம் மண்ணின் மிசையே?

kalakka ēḻ kaṭal ēḻ malai ulaku ēḻum kaḻiyak kaṭāy  
ulakkat tērkoṭu ceṉṟa māyamum uṭpaṭa maṟṟum pala,  
valakkai āḻi iṭakkaic caṅkam ivai uṭai mālvaṇṇaṉai,  
malakkum nā uṭaiyēṟku māṟu uḷatō im maṇṇiṉ micaiyē?

**English translation of verse 6.4.9:**

By my tongue (love-inspired) I captivate the cloud-hued Lord  
Who the discus wields in right hand and the conch in His left,  
Who (as Kṛṣṇa) drove to the regions afar, in a chariot deft,  
Across the seas seven, the mountains seven and the seven worlds  
And many such wonders did perform; equal unto me  
Could there, in all the land, any one be?

#### Notes

\(i\) The episode of Śrī Kṛṣṇa going in a chariot, along with a Brahmin and Arjuna, to the ultra-mundane region and restoring to the Brahmin, his missing children, reclaimed from Heaven, has been set forth, in detail, in the notes below III-10-5.

\(ii\) Saint Nammāḻvār is also known as Parāṅkuśa, the goad weaning round his spiritual antagonists through his scintillating hymns and making the Lord Himself pliable, enraptured by these sweet, love-laden hymns. The significance of this name has well been brought out. in this song. The discus and conch in the Lord’s hands typify ‘Time’ and ‘space’ or ‘infinity’ and ‘immensity’, respectively. As Śrī Parāśara Bhaṭṭar elucidated, while discoursing on this song, it is indeed impossible to enclose and entrap a God of this nature, but the prodigality of a Saint’s love does exceed these limits and encompasses even the Infinite. Verily, a God of ‘Space’ and ‘Time’ is like a wayward Elephant, roaming at liberty, unrestrained and even such an  
Elephant, Saint Nammāḻvār, rather Parāṅkuśa, in this context, claims to curb and restrain. That is why he is significantly referring to the cloud-hued Lord along with His attributes, namely, ‘Discus’ and ‘Conch’.
