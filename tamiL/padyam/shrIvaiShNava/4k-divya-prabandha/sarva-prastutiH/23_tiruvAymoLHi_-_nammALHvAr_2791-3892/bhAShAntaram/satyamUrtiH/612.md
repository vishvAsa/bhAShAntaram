Despite the [Āḻvār](/definition/aḻvar#vaishnavism "show Āḻvār definitions")’s intense longing for communion with the Lord enshrined in [Vāṉamāmalai](/definition/vanamamalai#vaishnavism "show Vāṉamāmalai definitions"), at whose feet he fell like an uprooted [tree](/definition/tree#history "show tree definitions") and sought refuge, he was not favoured with the Lord’s presence. The Āḻvār now turns his attention to the Lord gracing Tirukkuṭantai ([Kumbakonam](/definition/kumbakonam#history "show Kumbakonam definitions") in Tamiḻnādu), hoping that He might be intending to grant him audience at that centre. The Āḻvār is contemplating with all the fervour at his command, the enchanting prospect of the Lord casting His sweet glances at him, conversing with him and [gathering](/definition/gathering#history "show gathering definitions") him up to His bosom, in sweet embrace. Akrūra was also in such a happy reminiscent mood during his journey to Vrindāvan to fetch [Kṛṣṇa](/definition/krishna#vaishnavism "show Kṛṣṇa definitions") to [Kaṃsa](/definition/kamsa#vaishnavism "show Kaṃsa definitions")’s court. Whereas Akrūra had his ambition duly fulfilled, the Āḻvār has once again met with disappointment, like [Bharata](/definition/bharata#vaishnavism "show Bharata definitions") who could not prevail over [Śrī Rāma](/definition/shrirama#history "show Śrī Rāma definitions") to get back to [Ayodhya](/definition/ayodhya#vaishnavism "show Ayodhya definitions") from exile. Depressed like the babe, wanting to suck milk from the mother’s breast, being denied access by the mother, the Āḻvār ends this decad on a despondent note, exclaiming that he just doesn’t know how many more pilgrim centres he has still to knock at in this manner.
