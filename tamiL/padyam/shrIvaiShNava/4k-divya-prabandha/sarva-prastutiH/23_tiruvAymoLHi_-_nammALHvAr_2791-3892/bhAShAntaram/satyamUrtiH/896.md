**Tamil text and transliteration:**

வைகுந்த நாதன் என வல்வினை மாய்ந்து அறச்,  
செய் குந்தன் தன்னை என் ஆக்கி என்னால் தன்னை,  
வைகுந்தன் ஆகப் புகழ வண் தீம்கவி,  
செய் குந்தன் தன்னை எந்நாள் சிந்தித்து ஆர்வனோ!

vaikunta nātaṉ eṉa valviṉai māyntu aṟac,  
cey kuntaṉ taṉṉai eṉ ākki eṉṉāl taṉṉai,  
vaikuntaṉ ākap pukaḻa vaṇ tīmkavi,  
cey kuntaṉ taṉṉai ennāḷ cintittu ārvaṉō!

**English translation of verse 7.9.7:**

My heart’s fill I never can have, however long I muse  
Over my beneficent Lord who did enthuse  
Me to sing songs, sweet beyond compare, of His glory  
As the heavenly Lord, cleansing me of my sins gory  
And putting me on a par with Him, mingling freely.

**Notes:**

The Lord of the Universe, Chief of the exalted Celestials has condescended to shed His limitless grace on a great sinner, and cleanse him throughly, making him pure like Him. And what more? The regenerated Āḻvār, of immaculate purity, is made by Him to sing His heavenly glory and grandeur to His great delectation. It is indeed amazing that the Lord should feel that He flourishes only as a result of the Āḻvār’s laudation; this is akin to a father, who gifted away a cow to his son, getting back the same cow as the latter’s gift. So great is the Lord’s loving condescension that the Āḻvār can’t but muse over it endlessly. Even so, he cannot do adequate justice, seeing that the span of life is much-too-short while the magnitude of the favours heaped on him by the Lord is much-too-large.
