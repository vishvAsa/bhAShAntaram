**Tamil text and transliteration:**

கோவாகிய மாவலியை நிலம்கொண்டாய்  
தேவாசுரம் செற்றவனே! திருமாலே  
நாவாய்உறைகின்ற என்நாரணநம்பீ  
'ஆஆ அடியான் இவன் என்று அருளாயே.

kōvākiya māvaliyai nilamkoṇṭāy  
tēvācuram ceṟṟavaṉē! tirumālē  
nāvāyuṟaikiṉṟa eṉnāraṇanampī  
'āā aṭiyāṉ ivaṉ eṉṟu aruḷāyē.

**English translation of verse 9.8.7:**

Nāraṇaṉ, my Benefactor great, Who in Nāvāy dwells,  
Oh, Tirumāl, Who did the Asuras quell  
In their fray with Devas! You did from Māvali beg  
And wrest the land whereof he thought he was the master big;  
“Ha! here is My vassal”, you should cognise  
And on me bestow your grace spontaneous.

**Notes:**

‘Tirumāl’ denotes the Lord in conjunction with Śrī Mahā Lakṣmī, highly conducive to the protection of the devout, routing their enemies and other impediments in the way of their attainment of God. It is against this favourable background that the Āḻvār beseeches the Lord’s grace. The Lord had installed Indra, as the Sovereign Lord of all the three worlds but Mahā Bali seized them from Indra by force and proclaimed himself the master. Lord Mahā Viṣṇu set matters right, dexterously, by exploiting Bali’s avowed munificence.
