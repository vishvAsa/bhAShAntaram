**Tamil text and transliteration:**

அளிக்கும் பரமனை கண்ணனை ஆழிப் பிரான் தன்னை,  
துளிக்கும் நறும் கண்ணித் தூமணி வண்ணன் எம்மான்தன்னை,  
ஒளிக் கொண்ட சோதியை உள்ளத்துக் கொள்ளும் அவர் கண்டீர்,  
சலிப்பு இன்றி ஆண்டு எம்மைச் சன்ம சன்மாந்தரம் காப்பரே.

aḷikkum paramaṉai kaṇṇaṉai āḻip pirāṉ taṉṉai,  
tuḷikkum naṟum kaṇṇit tūmaṇi vaṇṇaṉ emmāṉtaṉṉai,  
oḷik koṇṭa cōtiyai uḷḷattuk koḷḷum avar kaṇṭīr,  
calippu iṉṟi āṇṭu emmaic caṉma caṉmāntaram kāpparē.

**English translation of verse 3.7.6:**

They shall my saviours be and govern  
In all my births, without break, that do enshrine  
In their hearts, Kaṇṇaṉ, the donor superfine,  
Of radiant form, like unto the blue gem immaculate,  
Who does the discus wield and tuḷaci garland sport,  
With fragrance full, shedding honey in plenty.

**Notes**

\(i\) *Donor superfine*: The Lord is not merely the Donor Supreme but also the Donor Superfine in that He gifts Himself away as He did during His Avatāra as Kṛṣṇa.

\(ii\) *The (beneficent) discus*: The Lord would not only give of Himself to His devotees but also give them His extraordinary weapons as He did in the case of King Ambarīṣa. The Lord’s alert discus served as the King’s bodyguard and went in hot pursuit of sage Durvāsa.

\(iii\) No doubt, the Āḻvār courted, in the opening song of this decad, future births, if he could thereby serve the Lord’s devotees without break but now, the protection extended by them unto him, referred to in this song, would be by way of safeguarding him against the pitfalls leading to rebirth.
