**Tamil text and transliteration:**

நின்று இலங்கு முடியினாய்! இருபத்தோர் கால் அரசு களைகட்ட  
வென்றி நீள்மழுவா! வியன் ஞாலம் முன் படைத்தாய்!  
இன்று இவ் ஆயர் குலத்தை வீடு உய்யத் தோன்றிய கருமாணிக்கச் சுடர்  
நின்தன்னால் நலிவே படுவோம் என்றும் ஆய்ச்சியோமே.

niṉṟu ilaṅku muṭiyiṉāy! irupattōr kāl aracu kaḷaikaṭṭa  
veṉṟi nīḷmaḻuvā! viyaṉ ñālam muṉ paṭaittāy!  
iṉṟu iv āyar kulattai vīṭu uyyat tōṉṟiya karumāṇikkac cuṭar  
niṉtaṉṉāl nalivē paṭuvōm eṉṟum āycciyōmē.

**English translation of verse 6.2.10:**

Oh, Sire of sapphire hue. You sport the crown grand  
With Your axe triumphant You did root out the kings  
For generations, the vast Universe You created once,  
And now You are here to redeem this shepherd clan,  
But we shepherdesses are by You tormented for ever.

#### Note

The rancour of the overzealous Gopīs would obviously not last long, as it is but a temporary phase, an interim facet of connubial relationship, culminating in the reunion of the lover and the beloveds. Śrī Kṛṣṇa didn’t merely kick the houses etc, put up by the Gopīs during play, but kicked their rancour out and made them gaze at His exquisite Form, from the lotus feet upwards, right up to His crown. It is only the Victor that wears the crown and by mentioning the grandeur of His crown, the Gopis mean to acknowledge Him as the Victor, in their erstwhile squabble. Even as He created the worlds, with all their contents, from the melting pot to which they had been consigned earlier, He has infused fresh life into the Gopīs who had earlier been the victims of devastating feminine jealousy. For Him, who as Paraśurāma, destroyed the haughty Kṣatriya kings, extending over twenty-one generations, is it at all much of a job to get the better of the frail Gopīs? Of course, the Gopīs know, that rejoining their Lord now doesn’t mean perpetual enjoyment of His company and they are in for further spells of misery, due to separation from Him. Even so, they are prepared to brave it and get back to Him at least for the time-being.
