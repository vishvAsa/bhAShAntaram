**Tamil text and transliteration:**

இவள் இராப்பகல் வாய்வெரீ இத், தன  
குவளை ஒண் கண்ண நீர் கொண்டாள், வண்டு  
திவளும் தண் அம் துழாய் கொடீர், என  
தவள வண்ணர் தகவுகளே.

ivaḷ irāppakal vāyverī it, taṉa  
kuvaḷai oṇ kaṇṇa nīr koṇṭāḷ, vaṇṭu  
tivaḷum taṇ am tuḻāy koṭīr, eṉa  
tavaḷa vaṇṇar takavukaḷē.

**English translation of verse 2.4.5:**

Day and night this girl keeps babbling  
And in her flowery eyes tears are swelling;  
You don’t on her bestow your tulacī garland, cool and lovely,  
Swarmed by bees; What has happened, (I can’t see)  
To you of disposition pure and your qualify of mercy.

**Note**

\(i\) [Mother to the Lord:]

> “Well, if you don’t relent even in such a precarious condition of my > daughter what indeed has happened to your quality of mercy? Has it > dried up altogether? >
> My daughter is talking about you all the time whereas it should be the > other way round. We know from > Hanumān’s > report to Sītā > how you kept pining for her, spending sleepless days and rights, > thinking and talking about her all the time. Oh, what a pity! the eyes > of my daughter which should shed tears of joy are bursting with > sorrow. After all, what does she want from you? Nothing more than the > cool tulacī garland from your person in replacement of the withered > one on her feverish body, consumed by the pangs of separation from > you. Actually, she envies the bees gaily swarming your garland studded > with honey, and even wishes that she had been born as one of those > fortunate bees”.

\(ii\) Reference has been made by the mother to the Lord’s purity of disposition and quality of mercy in this context rather sneeringly. Śrī Parāśara Bhaṭṭar would put it that the mother means to say,

> “Well, if there were a few persons like you the girls would indeed > prosper very well!”
