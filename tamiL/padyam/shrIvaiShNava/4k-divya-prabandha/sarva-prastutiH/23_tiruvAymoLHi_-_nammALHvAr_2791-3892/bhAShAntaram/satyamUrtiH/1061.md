**Tamil text and transliteration:**

ஆதும்இல்லை மற்றுஅவனில் என்றுஅதுவே துணிந்து  
தாதுசேர்தோள் கண்ணனைக் குருகூர்ச்சடகோபன்சொன்ன  
தீதுஇலாத ஒண்தமிழ்கள் இவைஆயிரத்துள் இப்பத்தும்  
ஓதவல்லபிராக்கள் நம்மை ஆளுடையார்கள் பண்டே. (2)

ātumillai maṟṟuavaṉil eṉṟuatuvē tuṇintu  
tātucērtōḷ kaṇṇaṉaik kurukūrccaṭakōpaṉcoṉṉa  
tītuilāta oṇtamiḻkaḷ ivaiāyirattuḷ ippattum  
ōtavallapirākkaḷ nammai āḷuṭaiyārkaḷ paṇṭē. (2)

**English translation of verse 9.1.11:**

The benefactors great, well-versed in these songs ten,  
Out of the impeccable thousand, in chaste Tamil, of Caṭakōpaṉ  
Of Kurukūr, Who did his unflinching faith pin  
Solely on Lord Kaṇṇan, with garland bedecked,  
Are unto him and others of his ilk Masters, since long back.

**Notes:**

\(i\) The great ones, who learn and chant this decad, are said \\to attract unto them, as their vassals, the Lord’s devotees like the Āḻvār, right from the moment these chanters acquired the physical frames which eventually led them on to the study and recital of this decad.

\(ii\) It is the Āḻvār’s firm faith in the Supreme Lord, as the ‘Means’ and the ‘End’, that manifested itself as this d cad, where he declares that Lord Kṛṣṇa is all. This robust faith in Him was, in turn, induced by the Lord’s exquisite Form, His sinewy shoulders sporting the lovely tuḷaci garland.

\(iii\) The impeccability of this hymnal has already been stressed upon, in several places. Unlike Rāmāyaṇa and Mahābhārata, which introduce several extraneous matters as well, Tiruvāymoḻi dwells exclusively on the Supreme Lord.
