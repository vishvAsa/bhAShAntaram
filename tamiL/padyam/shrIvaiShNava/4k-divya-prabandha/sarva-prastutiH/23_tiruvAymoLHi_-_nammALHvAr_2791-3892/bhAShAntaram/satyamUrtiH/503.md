**[Tamil](/definition/tamil#history "show Tamil definitions") text and transliteration:**

உடம்பினால் குறைவு இல்லா உயிர் பிரிந்த மலைத்துண்டம்,  
கிடந்தனபோல் துணி பலவா அசுரர் குழாம் துணித்து உகந்த,  
தடம் புனல சடைமுடியன் தனி ஒருகூறு அமர்ந்து உறையும்,  
உடம்பு உடையான் கவராத உயிரினால் குறைவு இலமே.

uṭampiṉāl kuṟaivu illā uyir pirinta malaittuṇṭam,  
kiṭantaṉapōl [tuṇi](/definition/tuni#history "show tuṇi definitions") palavā acurar kuḻām tuṇittu ukanta,  
taṭam puṉala caṭaimuṭiyaṉ taṉi orukūṟu amarntu uṟaiyum,  
uṭampu uṭaiyāṉ kavarāta uyiriṉāl kuṟaivu ilamē.

**English translation of verse 4.8.10:**

My Soul I can hardly love if it repels the Lord.  
Who into bits many did split the hefty Asura hordes  
And complacent fed, on whose body huge does reside  
[Śiva](/definition/shiva#vaishnavism "show Śiva definitions"), bearing the cool waters (of [Gaṅgā](/definition/ganga#vaishnavism "show Gaṅgā definitions")) on matted locks.

**Note**

The essential [nature](/definition/nature#history "show nature definitions") of the Soul is to subserve the Lord but if He doesn’t like to take service from it, it just doesn’t deserve to exist. The immortality of the Soul is not to be brought in here and the point at issue confused. What is emphasised here is that things which are not linked up with God, are as good as non-existent. The Nāyakī is indeed vexed that the Lord who has allotted a portion of His body even to Śiva whose ego often times gets bloated and makes him fed that he is the Supreme, does not oblige her likewise. It is a pity that the Lord who destroyed all the evil forces out of loving condescension for the welfare of His devotees, should be indifferent to the Nāyakī, who is as good as non-existent (asat), when not sustained by His loving attention.
