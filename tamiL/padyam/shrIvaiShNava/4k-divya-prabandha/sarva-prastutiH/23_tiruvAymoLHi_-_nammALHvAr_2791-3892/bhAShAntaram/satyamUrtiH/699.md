**[Tamil](/definition/tamil#history "show Tamil definitions") text and transliteration:**

மனப் பரிப்போடு அழுக்கு மானிட சாதியில் தான்பிறந்து,  
தனக்கு வேண்டு உருக்கொண்டு தான் தன சீற்றத்தினை முடிக்கும்,  
புனத் துழாய் முடி மாலை மார்பன் என் அப்பன் தன் மாயங்களே,  
நினைக்கும் நெஞ்சு உடையேன் எனக்கு இனி யார் நிகர் நீள் நிலத்தே?

maṉap parippōṭu aḻukku māṉiṭa cātiyil tāṉpiṟantu,  
taṉakku vēṇṭu urukkoṇṭu tāṉ taṉa cīṟṟattiṉai muṭikkum,  
puṉat tuḻāy muṭi [mālai](/definition/malai#history "show mālai definitions") mārpaṉ eṉ appaṉ taṉ māyaṅkaḷē,  
niṉaikkum neñcu uṭaiyēṉ eṉakku iṉi yār nikar nīḷ nilattē?

**English translation of verse 6.4.7:**

Is there any one, a match unto me, in this huge world,  
Possessing as I do, a mind wholly absorbed in the wondrous deeds  
Of my Sire, wearing tuḷaci garland fresh, on His crown  
And winsome chest, the radiant Lord assuming Forms of His own  
And coming into the midst of the dirty humans,  
Just to give vent to His fury and quell ungodly demons?

#### Notes

\(i\) The last [line](/definition/line#history "show line definitions") conveys the cream of this song. The benevolent Lord gets terribly furious when His devotees are offended against; if He came down and took [birth](/definition/birth#history "show birth definitions") among the humans, with all their dirt and squalor and engaged Himself in a duel with [Hiraṇya](/definition/hiranya#history "show Hiraṇya definitions") and [Rāvaṇa](/definition/ravana#vaishnavism "show Rāvaṇa definitions"), it was because of the terrible affront they had thrown at His devotees. The Lord’s [anger](/definition/anger#history "show anger definitions") would not get appeased until He tormented and tortured the offenders, even though He could quell them all, by a mere resolve, without moving His little finger. This is how the illustrious Nañcīyar would interpret the Lord’s advent and obviously, he derived his authority from the text of this song. Nampilḻai puts it that the mother’s anger over those, who tease and [torment](/definition/torment#history "show torment definitions") her child, can subside only when she pours forth her ire on them. In this simile the mother takes the place of the Lord and the child, that of His devotee.

\(ii\) The Tuḷaci garland, cool and fresh, will be worn by the Lord only when His anger subsides after the extermination of the enemies of His devotees.

\(iii\) For His Avatāras, the Lord assumes the form of His choice, eminently suited for the purpose—“Icchā grahīto abhimatoru dehaḥ”, as the Sages put it and “Sambhavāmi ātmamāyayā”, as the Lord Himself has stated in [Bhagavad Gita](/definition/bhagavad-gita#vaishnavism "show Bhagavad Gita definitions") (4-6). The word ‘ātmamāyayā’ means ‘ātmecchayā’, (as He likes).
