**Tamil text and transliteration:**

மடந்தையர் வாழ்த்தலும் மருதரும் வசுக்களும்  
தொடர்ந்து எங்கும் தோத்திரம் சொல்லினர் தொடுகடல்-  
கிடந்த எம்கேசவன் கிளர்ஒளி மணிமுடி  
குடந்தை எம்கோவலன் குடிஅடி யார்க்கே

maṭantaiyar vāḻttalum marutarum vacukkaḷum  
toṭarntu eṅkum tōttiram colliṉar toṭukaṭal-  
kiṭanta emkēcavaṉ kiḷaroḷi maṇimuṭi  
kuṭantai emkōvalaṉ kuṭiaṭi yārkkē

**English translation of verse 10.9.7:**

When the ladies sang the glory of these great marchers  
Who did from generations serve Kēcavaṉ, our Sire,  
Who did repose on the ocean unfathomable and now reclines  
In Kuṭantai sporting the gleaming gem-set crown,  
The ‘Marutars’ and ‘Vacus’ did their glory laud  
And kept following them as far as they could.

**Notes:**

\(i\) Not satisfied with what they did, in their respective areas, unto the distinguished marchers to Heaven, the ‘Maruth Gaṇas’ and ‘Aṣṭa Vasus’ went beyond their territorial limits, as far as they could, singing all the time the glory of these great souls on their upward journey. As a matter of fact, even these Devas, reputed for their rapid movements with immense speed, could not keep pace with the holy band on their heavenly ascent, as they were speeding fast towards the Lord in Heaven, Who would not brook separation from them, any longer.

\(ii\) The Heaven-bound Śrī Vaiṣṇavas are adored and revered by the people *en route*, as the hereditary vassals of the Lord, enshrined in Tirukkuṭantai (Kumbakōṇam in Tamil Nādu), the ‘Insatiable Nectar’. So great was Nammāḻvār’s fascination for this holy centre where the Lord reclines on the serpent-bed, out of loving condescension that he could not lift his mind off it, even at this crucial stage. Tirumaṅkai Āḻvār, who closely followed in the foot-steps of Nammāḻvār, also began and wound up his grand hymnals by referring to the holy Tirukkuṭantai.
