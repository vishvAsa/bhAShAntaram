In the end-stanza of the preceding decad, the [Āḻvār](/definition/aḻvar#vaishnavism "show Āḻvār definitions") had referred to himself as one possessed of a clear vision, absolutely free from [doubt](/definition/doubt#history "show doubt definitions") and despair, discrepancies and deviations. But in the very next song, that is, the first song of this decad, he seeks clarification of certain [doubts](/definition/doubt#history "show doubts definitions") and thus betrays his ignorance. Well, ignorance is of four different kinds, namely (1) *Non-comprehension*. (2) *comprehension, halfway beset with doubts*, (3) *miscomprehension and* (4) *lapse of memory resulting in not remembering a thing previously known*. In the present case, the Āḻvār is assailed by doubts and yet, it transcends the above types of ignorance to which those still relatively unevolved and in the grip of nescience resulting from [Karma](/definition/karma#vaishnavism "show Karma definitions"), are susceptible. Here it is the bewitching splendour of Lord Aḻakar which defies description and baffles correct and complete comprehension. Enthralled by the charming personality of the Lord, the Āḻvār enquires of the Lord, “Sire, has the effulgence of your face expanded itself upwards into the dazzling crown and Your dazzling feet likewise expanded into the lotus [seat](/definition/seat#history "show seat definitions") on which they are poised?” It is the exuberance of their God-love, too deep for words, that throws the [Āḻvārs](/definition/aḻvar#vaishnavism "show Āḻvārs definitions") into an ecstatic state of mental imbalance and this only redounds to their glory.

The Āḻvār who expounded the glory of Mount ‘[Māliruñcōlai](/definition/maliruncolai#vaishnavism "show Māliruñcōlai definitions")’ in the last decad, now proceeds to drink deep of the nectarean charm and enthralling beauty of Lord Aḻakar (The Beautiful), enshrined there.
