**Tamil text and transliteration:**

தலைமேல தாள்இணைகள் தாமரைக்கண் என்அம்மான்  
நிலைபேரான் எனநெஞ்சத்து எப்பொழுதும் எம்பெருமான்  
மலைமாடத்து அரவுஅணைமேல் வாட்டாற்றான் மதம்மிக்க  
கொலையானை மருப்புஒசித்தான் குரைகழல்கள் குறுகினமே.

talaimēla tāḷiṇaikaḷ tāmaraikkaṇ eṉammāṉ  
nilaipērāṉ eṉaneñcattu eppoḻutum emperumāṉ  
malaimāṭattu aravuaṇaimēl vāṭṭāṟṟāṉ matammikka  
kolaiyāṉai maruppuocittāṉ kuraikaḻalkaḷ kuṟukiṉamē.

**English translation of verse 10.6.6:**

The lovely pair of feet of my lotus-eyed Sire,  
I wear on my head, stays He in my heart for ever,  
My Lord, Who unto me His glory did reveal,  
Reclines on serpent-couch amid castles tall,  
In Tiruvāṭṭāṟu; the valorous feet we did attain  
Of the Lord by Whom the monstrous elephant was slain.

**Notes:**

\(i\) Once again, the Āḻvār enumerates the favours heaped on him by the benign Lord. Having set His lovely pair of feet on the Āḻvār’s head, the Lord casts on him glances, cool and sweet, from His lotus eyes. And then, He stands firmly in the Āḻvār’s heart, rivetted, as it were. Questioned by his disciples, as to how the Lord could simultaneously stand on the Āḻvār’s head, cast His sweet glances on him and stay inside his heart, Nampiḷḷai cited the example of Sage Saubhari who assumed fifty different forms to enjoy conjugal bliss with his fifty wives. The Lord should have likewise assumed a number of forms to enjoy the Āḻvār in different ways, all at once.

\(ii\) Describing the Lord at Tiruvāṭṭāṟu, as reclining on the serpent couch, the Āḻvār would appear to picture in his mind the stepping on to the Lord’s lap, right on His serpent couch in the yonder heaven, by the ‘Muktā’ (Released Soul), as the Upaniṣads make out.

\(iii\) The slaying of Kuvalayāpīḍam, the formidable elephant in must set upon Lord Kṛṣṇa by the tyrannical Kaṃsa, by the Lord pulling out its tusks, signifies the riddance by the Lord of all ills and evils, the impediments in the way of the Āḻvār attaining Him.
