**[Tamil](/definition/tamil#history "show Tamil definitions") text and transliteration:**

நெடுமாற்குஅடிமை செய்வேன்போல் அவனைக் கருத வஞ்சித்து  
தடுமாற்றுஅற்ற தீக்கதிகள் முற்றும் தவிர்ந்த சதிர்நினைந்தால்  
கொடுமாவினையேன் அவன்அடியார் அடியே கூடும் இதுஅல்லால்  
விடுமாறுஎன்பதுஎன்? அந்தோ! வியன் மூவுலகு பெறினுமே?. (2)

neṭumāṟkuaṭimai ceyvēṉpōl avaṉaik karuta vañcittu  
taṭumāṟṟuaṟṟa tīkkatikaḷ muṟṟum tavirnta catirniṉaintāl  
koṭumāviṉaiyēṉ avaṉaṭiyār aṭiyē kūṭum ituallāl  
viṭumāṟueṉpatueṉ? antō! viyaṉ mūvulaku peṟiṉumē?. (2)

**English translation of verse 8.10.1:**

If even the mere thought of simulating service unto the Lord,  
Who for His devotees bears love immense, could truly rid  
Me of all my cruel sins, unknown to me, can this sinner great  
Give up service unto His devotees, at their lovely feet?  
Need I say, except this, I would reject outright all else  
Be it even a gift unto me of all the worlds immense?

**Notes:**

If the mere wish of the [Āḻvār](/definition/aḻvar#vaishnavism "show Āḻvār definitions"), with hardly any semblance of sincerity to serve the Lord, could surely blot out all his deadly sins, that very moment, without his being aware of the whole process how much more beneficial could whole-hearted devotion to His apostles be? This is how the Āḻvār revolved, in his mind, seeing that the Lord bears inordinate love for His devotees and service unto His devotees would, therefore surely please Him much more than direct service unto Him. If the Āḻvār were to choose between service unto the Lord’s devotees on the one hand, and possession of the combined wealth of all the three worlds devolving on him as an unconditional gift on the other, he would not set his eye on the latter but firmly stick to the former; the latter stands no comparison whatever with the former.
