**Tamil text and transliteration:**

'ஈவு இலாத தீவினைகள் எத்தனை செய்தனன்கொல்?  
தாவி வையம் கொண்ட எந்தாய்! தாமோதரா! என்று என்று  
கூவிக் கூவி நெஞ்சு உருகி கண்பனி சோர நின்றால்,  
பாவி நீ என்று ஒன்று சொல்லாய் பாவியேன் காண வந்தே.

'īvu ilāta tīviṉaikaḷ ettaṉai ceytaṉaṉkol?  
tāvi vaiyam koṇṭa entāy! tāmōtarā! eṉṟu eṉṟu  
kūvik kūvi neñcu uruki kaṇpaṉi cōra niṉṟāl,  
pāvi nī eṉṟu oṉṟu collāy pāviyēṉ kāṇa vantē.

**English translation of verse 4.7.3:**

Endless sins I should have indeed committed,  
Therefore it is, You come not before this sinner,  
At least to say so, though I call You out many times over,  
With melting heart and teaiful eyes, as my Lord,  
Who measured the worlds and Tāmōtarā, (got bound by a cord).

**Note**

The Āḻvār lustily calls out the Lord, stressing alternately His transcendent glory when He measured all the regions, high and low, in just three strides, and His amazing simplicity as the naughty child (Tāmōtarā), whose tummy was bound by a rope, as a punishment for stealing butter. It matters not to him whether the Lord calls Him a Saint or a Sinner and even if the Lord wants to despise him as a sinner, the Āḻvār would want Him to come, face to face, and say so, as he will then have the pleasure of seeing Him. Even if the Lord would not appear before the Āḻvār, the latter will be pleased if the Lord could tell, within his hearing, that he is a despicable sinner. The Āḻvār will then have the satisfaction of hearing the Lord’s voice.
