**Tamil text and transliteration:**

மாயம் அறிபவர் மாயவற்கு ஆள்அன்றி ஆவரோ,  
தாயம் செறும் ஒரு நூற்றுவர் மங்க ஓர்ஐவர்க்குஆய்,  
தேசம் அறிய ஓர் சாரதியாய்ச் சென்று சேனையை  
நாசம் செய்திட்டு, நடந்த நல் வார்த்தை அறிந்துமே?

māyam aṟipavar māyavaṟku āḷaṉṟi āvarō,  
tāyam ceṟum oru nūṟṟuvar maṅka ōraivarkkuāy,  
tēcam aṟiya ōr cāratiyāyc ceṉṟu cēṉaiyai  
nācam ceytiṭṭu, naṭanta nal vārttai aṟintumē?

**English translation of verse 7.5.9:**

Will those well-versed with the wondrous Lord’s exploits magnificent  
Ever subserve any but Him, so loving and munificent,  
Knowing how He became world-famous as the peerless charioteer,  
For the sake of the illustrious five to whom He did cater,  
Annihilating their hundred coparceners unfriendly and did the armies shatter  
And the heartening word that He went to the Celestium thereafter?

**Notes:**

Oh, what an amazing simplicity! the Supreme Lord of the entire Universe did the mean job of driving Arjuna’s chariot and that too, in public, on the battle field. When, at his sweet will, a superior person condescends to serve a subordinate, it is usually done *in camera*, and not in public. But here is the Divine charioteer, who not only kept Himself open to public gaze in His Incarnate Form as Kṛṣṇa, but even to day stands before us, in His Iconic (worshippable)

Form as ‘Pārtha Sārathi’ (Arjuna’s charioteer) at Triplicane (Tiru-allikkēṇi) in Madras, and as Pāṇḍava Dhūta in Tamilnadu (near Madras) and also in Kāñcī (also in Tamil nadu).
