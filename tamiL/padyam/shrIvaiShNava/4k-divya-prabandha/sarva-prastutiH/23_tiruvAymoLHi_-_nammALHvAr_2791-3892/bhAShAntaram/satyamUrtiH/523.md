**Tamil text and transliteration:**

பேச நின்ற சிவனுக்கும் பிரமன் தனக்கும் பிறர்க்கும்  
நாயகன் அவனே, கபால நல் மோக்கத்துக் கண்டுகொண்மின்,  
தேச மாமதிள் சூழ்ந்து அழகு ஆய திருக்குருகூர் அதனுள்,  
ஈசன்பால் ஓர் அவம் பறைதல் என் ஆவது இலிங்கியர்க்கே?

pēca niṉṟa civaṉukkum piramaṉ taṉakkum piṟarkkum  
nāyakaṉ avaṉē, kapāla nal mōkkattuk kaṇṭukoṇmiṉ,  
tēca māmatiḷ cūḻntu aḻaku āya tirukkurukūr ataṉuḷ,  
īcaṉpāl ōr avam paṟaital eṉ āvatu iliṅkiyarkkē?

**English translation of verse 4.10.4:**

What use is it to the votaries of Iliṅkam, who take  
Their stand (on mere inference) and heresies talk  
About the Lord, in lovely Kurukūr enshrined,  
With smart and stately walls around?  
Learn, ye men, who talk of Civaṉ as God Supreme,  
From the way the skull in his hand was redeemed  
That He (Nārāyaṇa) is unto him, Brahmā and others, the Lord Supreme

**Notes:**

\(i\) Those who determine the Supremacy of God, purely on the basis of inference, as well as those who assert the Supremacy of Śiva (*Iliṅkam*) and Brahmā, are disabused of their wrong notions by this song. Basing their stand on certain texts, in isolation, some people affirm the Supremacy of Śiva and some others look upon Brahmā, as the Supreme. There are, however, various other texts establishing the Supremacy of Viṣṇu, Relying on these numerous texts, Saint Nammāḻvār has clarified the position here and asserted the overlordship of Viṣṇu.

\(ii\) The five-headed Siva, born of the five-headed Brahmā, abhorred the similarity between him and his sire and, in an uncontrollable moment, plucked out one of Brahmā’s heads, by way of removing the vexatious parity. The skull of the Father, however, stuck fast to the Son’s palm. On the advice of the Sages and Devas, Śiva went a-begging. The skull would not drop out, unless it was filled with the alms and unfortunately, it was never full. It was only when he went to Badri-nāth and appealed to Lord Nārāyaṇa that He gave alms, uttering the word ‘akṣaya [*akṣayaṃ*]’ (plenty) and instantly, the skull got completely filled up and dropped out of Śiva’s palm. Surely, neither the chopper nor the chopped could be the Supreme God.
