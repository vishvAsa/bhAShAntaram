**Tamil text and transliteration:**

பேய் முலை உண்டு சகடம் பாய்ந்து மருது இடை-  
போய் முதல் சாய்த்து புள் வாய் பிளந்து களிறு அட்ட  
தூ முறுவல் தொண்டைவாய்ப் பிரானை எந் நாள்கொலோ  
யாம் உறுகின்றது தோழீ! அன்னையர் நாணவே?

pēy mulai uṇṭu cakaṭam pāyntu marutu iṭai-  
pōy mutal cāyttu puḷ vāy piḷantu kaḷiṟu aṭṭa  
tū muṟuval toṇṭaivāyp pirāṉai en nāḷkolō  
yām uṟukiṉṟatu tōḻī! aṉṉaiyar nāṇavē?

**English translation of verse 5.3.8:**

When shall we attain, my mate, the coral-lipped Lord,  
Of smiles pure, who the demon’s breast sucked, crawled  
‘Tween the twin trees and uprooted, unto pieces smashed  
The wheel, cleaved the bird’s beak and the elephant slammed,  
So that these elders do their heads hang ir shame?

#### Note

The Nāyakī enumerates the deeds of Lord Kṛṣṇa, directed towards the annihilation of the evil forces, the opponents of the devotees. If such a great Benefactor could come and join her, it would put to shame the elders who were all bereft of good qualities, condemning Him as heartless, faithless and so on. It needs to be specially noted that the Lord’s appearance is sought, in this song, by the Nāyaki, not for her embrace but to vindicate her Lord’s glory in the eyes of the elders as the One who is not only quite responsive but also remorseful. Did He not, as Śrī Rāma, rush to the Ṛṣis of Daṇḍakāraṇya, to enquire their needs and place His services at their disposal and apologise to them profusely, finding that they had already come a few steps forward to exhibit their sufferings at the hands of the Rākṣasas?
