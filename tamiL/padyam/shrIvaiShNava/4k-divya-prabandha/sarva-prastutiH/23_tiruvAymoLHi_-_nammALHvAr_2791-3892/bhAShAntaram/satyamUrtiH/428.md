This decad would appear to have been appreciated in three different ways by the ‘Pūrvācāryas’ (Preceptors of yore), as indicated below:

**Notes**

\(i\) According to Empār, the Lord did not, as such, fulfil the aspiration of the Āḻvār, as set out in the preceding decad, but focussed his attention on some of His auspicious traits enjoying which the Āḻvār remains oblivious of his erstwhile longing. This is like the baby crying for the Moon being appeased by a substitute, say, a Coconut.

\(ii\) Tirumalai Nampi would have it that the Āḻvār could be placated by a mere assurance from the Lord to fulfil his aspiration. According to this preceptor, the Lord would seem to have told the Āḻvār to his face that his aspiration would be duly met and this assurance was enough to make the Āḻvār forget his erstwhile misery and exult as in this decad.

\(iii\) Śrī Parāśara Bhaṭṭar does not seem to have been satisfied with such half-hearted compliance by the Lord. Time being at the beck and call of the Supreme Lord, He could certainly meet the demand of the Āḻvār and regale him. It is a fully satisfied Āḻvār who, according to Bhaṭṭarya, gives expression to the resultant joy in this decad.
