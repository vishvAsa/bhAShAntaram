**Tamil text and transliteration:**

பரவி வானவர் ஏத்த நின்ற பரமனை பரஞ்சோதியை,  
குரவை கோத்த குழகனை மணி வண்ணனை குடக் கூத்தனை,  
அரவம் ஏறி அலை கடல் அமரும் துயில்கொண்ட அண்ணலை,  
இரவும் நன் பகலும் விடாது என்றும் ஏத்துதல் மனம் வைம்மினோ.

paravi vāṉavar ētta niṉṟa paramaṉai parañcōtiyai,  
kuravai kōtta kuḻakaṉai maṇi vaṇṇaṉai kuṭak kūttaṉai,  
aravam ēṟi alai kaṭal amarum tuyilkoṇṭa aṇṇalai,  
iravum naṉ pakalum viṭātu eṉṟum ēttutal maṉam vaimmiṉō.

**English translation of verse 3.6.3:**

Day and night, without break, sing the glory of the supreme Lord,  
Set your mind on Him, by Devas profusely lauded,  
Who did (with Gopīs) tastefully dance, hand in hand,  
Of superlative splendour, the Pot-dancer of the complexion  
Of blue gem, reposing on His serpent-bed, in the surging ocean.

**Notes**

\(i\) And now, the Āḻvār introduces his audience to the Lord’s Avatāra as Kṛṣṇa, of unsurpassed simplicity and calls upon the folks to set their minds firmly on Him who cannot but be loved because of His loving condescension, tender solicitude, unique charm, adorability and a host of other auspicious attributes.

Tradition has it that Mother Earth bitterly complained to Brahmā about the atrocious burden she had to carry, with demoniac forces like Kaṃsa and Śiśupāla let loose on Earth. Brahmā and other Devas then made a bee-line to the Lord who was reclining on His serpent-bed in the milky ocean and petitioned to Him. Thereupon, the Lord came down as Kṛṣṇa and His task duly done, He went back to the Milky-ocean and rested on Ādiśeṣa, as before.

\(ii\) *The dance with the Gopīs*: It was a classical autumn night in the bright fortnight, the unique night of unparalleled excellence when the marvel of a dance, the immortal ‘Rāsa Krīḍā’, took place. ‘Śrī Kṛṣṇa played’ on His inimitable flute, sending out sweet strains of music in all directions with their irresistible appeal to the young damsels of the pastoral village. They all left their homes, defying obstruction from the elders and converged towaids the magic flautist. And then ensued the marvel of marvels, the wonderful wonder of wonders, the circular dance in which the ubiquitous Kṛṣṇa made Himself so very pliable as to be seen in between one Gopī and another, multiplying Himself in this fashion. Oh, how astounding that the Overlord of the Celestials in heaven should come down to Earth and mingle so freely with the shepherd-folks and be quite at home with them! And to those who missed witnessing this grand spectacle, He would exhibit His physical charm right at the cross-roads as the skilful Pot-dancer.
