திருமேனி அடிகளுக்குத் தீவினையேன் விடுதூதாய்  
திருமூழிக்களம் என்னும் செழுநகர்வாய் அணிமுகில்காள்  
திருமேனி அவட்குஅருளீர் என்றக்கால் உம்மைத்தன்  
திருமேனி ஒளிஅகற்றி தெளிவிசும்பு கடியுமே?

tirumēṉi aṭikaḷukkut tīviṉaiyēṉ viṭutūtāy  
tirumūḻikkaḷam eṉṉum ceḻunakarvāy aṇimukilkāḷ  
tirumēṉi avaṭkuaruḷīr eṉṟakkāl ummaittaṉ  
tirumēṉi oḷiakaṟṟi teḷivicumpu kaṭiyumē?

**English translation of verse 9.7.4:**

Ye, pretty [clouds](/definition/cloud#history "show clouds definitions"), were you to run an errand  
On behalf of this sinner unto my Master of form grand,  
Who does in holy Tirumūḻikkaḷam dwell  
And a word unto Him tell  
That He should unto me offer His body gracious,  
Do you [fear](/definition/fear#history "show fear definitions") that you He would punish,  
Put you off colour and out of the clear sky push?

**Notes:**

\(i\) *My Master of form grand*: His auspicious traits and wondrous deeds apart, the Lord’s enchanting Form is such as to enthral one and all, including the ungodly. Duryodhan [[Duryodhana](/definition/duryodhana#vaishnavism "show Duryodhana definitions")] and his men were studiously determined not to get up from their [seats](/definition/seat#history "show seats definitions") and extend any courtesy whatsoever to Lord [Kṛṣṇa](/definition/krishna#vaishnavism "show Kṛṣṇa definitions") when He arrived at the royal court, as the errand boy of the Pāṇḍavās. But, as soon as the Lord entered the court, all of them, including the deadly Duryodhan, stood up automatically, entranced by the unique halo and splendour of His enchanting Form.

\(ii\) Sinner though, the Nāyakī deems it her great good fortune to fall at the feet of these [birds](/definition/bird#history "show birds definitions"), the Lord’s devotees and to beg of them to tell the Lord in Tirumūḻikkaḷam, “Here is the Nāyakī languishing for you inside the hollow of the holy tamarind [tree](/definition/tree#history "show tree definitions") at [Āḻvār Tirunakari](/definition/alvar-tirunakari#vaishnavism "show Āḻvār Tirunakari definitions").” She exhorts the clouds not to apprehend any punishment for this, at the hands of the Lord, by way of pushing them out of the clear sky and depriving them of their lovely hue. On the other hand, the Lord will impart to them still greater lustre.
