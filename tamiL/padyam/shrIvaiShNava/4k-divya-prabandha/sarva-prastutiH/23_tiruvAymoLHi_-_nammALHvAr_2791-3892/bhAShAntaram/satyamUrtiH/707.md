**Tamil text and transliteration:**

குமுறும் ஓசை விழவு ஒலித் தொலைவில்லிமங்கலம் கொண்டுபுக்கு,  
அமுத மென் மொழியாளை நீர் உமக்கு ஆசை இன்றி அகற்றினீர்,  
திமிர் கொண்டால் ஒத்து நிற்கும் மற்று இவள்தேவ தேவபிரான் என்றே,  
நிமியும் வாயொடு கண்கள் நீர் மல்க நெக்கு ஒசிந்து கரையுமே.

kumuṟum ōcai viḻavu olit tolaivillimaṅkalam koṇṭupukku,  
amuta meṉ moḻiyāḷai nīr umakku ācai iṉṟi akaṟṟiṉīr,  
timir koṇṭāl ottu niṟkum maṟṟu ivaḷtēva tēvapirāṉ eṉṟē,  
nimiyum vāyoṭu kaṇkaḷ nīr malka nekku ocintu karaiyumē.

**English translation of verse 6.5.2:**

Ye, elders, brought you have to a point of no return,  
This lady with a tongue, sweet and soft, having taken  
Her to Toḷaiviḻlimaṅkaḻam with its fan-fare of festivals;  
Dazed she remains and mention of the name of the Lord universal  
Twists her mouth and brings forth tears in abundance  
From her eyes and keeps she withering down..

#### Notes

\(i\) Even the normal environment of Tolaivillimaṅkalam is enticing enough and what to talk of the festivities, with their rich and varied fares! The elders having brought the God-bent Nāyakī during the festival going on there, they stand no chance whatever of weaning her away from the Lord and the allied attractions. Incidentally, we get at the Śāstraik meaning that we would do well to get initiated into God-head through our elders, rather than the direct approach.

\(ii\) Could there be a tongue sweeter than that of the Lord's poet, singing the glory of that Insatiable Nectar? For the devout, the Āḻvār provides the nectarean hymrs to drink deep from.

\(iii\) The Nāyakī stands speechless like the profound Brahma Jñāni who scarcely speaks out. In the sixth prapāṭaka of Cāndogyopaniṣad, Svetaketu comes home after undergoing a twelve-year course of instruction (Gurukulavāsa) and finding him tongue-tied, his father instantly perceives that the boy has acquired Brahma Jñāna.
