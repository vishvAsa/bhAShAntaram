கோயில் கொண்டான்தன் திருக்கடித் தானத்தை  
கோயில்கொண்டான் அதனோடும் என்நெஞ்சகம்;  
கோயில்கொள் தெய்வம்எல்லாம் தொழ வைகுந்தம்  
கோயில்கொண்ட குடக்கூத்த அம்மானே.

**English translation of verse 8.6.5:**

The Lord Who is by the exalted Celestials adored,  
Who has the high [Heavens](/definition/heaven#history "show Heavens definitions") as His abode,  
Who (as [Kṛṣṇa](/definition/krishna#vaishnavism "show Kṛṣṇa definitions")) did the wondrous pot-[dance](/definition/dance#history "show dance definitions") perform  
Is the One Who made Tirukkaṭittāṉam His home,  
And has, along with that home, moved now into my heart,  
Making it His new habitat.

**Notes**

\(i\) As already elucidated, Tirukkaṭittāṉam was but the stepping stone, the spring-board whence the Lord could get into the [Āḻvār](/definition/aḻvar#vaishnavism "show Āḻvār definitions")‘s heart. The Lord initially thought of [entering](/definition/entering#history "show entering definitions") the Āḻvār’s heart, all alone, without His retinue and all that. But then, He changed His mind and entered the [Alvar](/definition/aḻvar#vaishnavism "show Alvar definitions")’s heart along with that pilgrim centre itself c.f. [Periyāḻvār](/definition/periyalvar#vaishnavism "show Periyāḻvār definitions") Tirumoḻi V-2-10, where Peryāḻvār says that the Lord resorted unto his body with His entire retinue, the [serpent](/definition/serpent#history "show serpent definitions")-bed, the Milk-ocean and the Divine Consort and rested on the cool crest of the ocean, to grant him the necessary protection.

\(ii\) The Lord incarnated as Kṛṣṇa, among the cowherds and performed the pot-dance; to get over the resultant fatigue, He released Himself at Tirukkaṭittāṉam and thence shifted to the Āḻvār’s heart, along with that pilgrim centre.
