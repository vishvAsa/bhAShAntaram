**Tamil text and transliteration:**

அம்மானாய்ப் பின்னும், எம்மாண்பும் ஆனான்,  
வெம் மா வாய் கீண்ட, செம்மா கண்ணனே.

ammāṉāyp piṉṉum, emmāṇpum āṉāṉ,  
vem mā vāy kīṇṭa, cemmā kaṇṇaṉē.

**English translation of verse 1.8.2:**

Our Sire (the Lord) with large, red eyes  
Came down as Kaṇṇaṉ (and mingled with us)  
Tore He the mouth of the demon fierce,  
Who (to Kill Him) came as a horse,  
Many indeed are His incarnations glorious

**Note**

Although specific mention has been made here of the Lord’s incarnation as Kṛṣṇa, there is also a broad reference to all His Avatāras as well, wherein He mixes with the worldlings with remarkable transparence, even as He does with the denizens in heaven.
