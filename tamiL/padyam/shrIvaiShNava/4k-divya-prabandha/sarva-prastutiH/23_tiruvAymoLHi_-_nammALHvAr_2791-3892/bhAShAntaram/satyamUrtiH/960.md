**Tamil text and transliteration:**

பிறிதுஇல்லை எனக்கு பெரியமூவுலகும் நிறையப்பேர் உருவமாய் நிமிர்ந்த  
குறியமாண் எம்மான் குரைகடல்கடைந்த கோலமாணிக்கம் என்அம்மான்  
செறிகுலைவாழைகமுகு தெங்கணிசூழ் திருச்செங்குன்றூர்த் திருச்சிற்றாறு  
அறிய மெய்ம்மையே நின்ற எம்பெருமான் அடிஇணை அல்லதுஓர் அரணே.

piṟituillai eṉakku periyamūvulakum niṟaiyappēr uruvamāy nimirnta  
kuṟiyamāṇ emmāṉ kuraikaṭalkaṭainta kōlamāṇikkam eṉammāṉ  
ceṟikulaivāḻaikamuku teṅkaṇicūḻ tirucceṅkuṉṟūrt tirucciṟṟāṟu  
aṟiya meymmaiyē niṉṟa emperumāṉ aṭiiṇai allatuōr araṇē.

**English translation of verse 8.4.4:**

Refuge have I none but the pair of feet of my Lord,  
Who stays in Tirucciṟṟāṟu with orchards, fine and fertile,  
In all His true splendour, the Benefactor great, Who did unto me reveal  
His emerald Form lovely, Vāmana, my Sire, Who grew big and spread  
All the worlds over, who the bellowing ocean once churned.

**Notes:**

\(i\) If, as a tender Babe, the Lord could hold in His stomach all the worlds, where was the need for Him to grow big and span all the worlds in three strides, instead of doing it in His diminutive Form as Vāmana, with which He had demanded the gift of land from Bali? The great Nampiḻḷai has a ready answer, admirable as usual. The expansion of the Lord’s Form into Tṛvikrama, was due to the exuberance of His joy in having accomplished the mission for which He incarnated.

\(ii\) Whenever the episode of the churning of the ocean is alluded to, the Āḻvār invariably feels why the Lord, of remarkable tenderness, should have under taken all the trouble, when there were large numbers of Devas and Asuras, rugged enough, for the job. Actually, those guys, with all their complement, were not equal to the task and the Lord had to assume two different forms and join both the groups, so as to put His own shoulders to the wheel and deliver the goods.

\(iii\) The Lord of such great prowess has manifested Himself in all His pristine splendour in the Iconic Form in which He stays at Tirucceṅkuṉṟūr Tirucciṟṟāṟu, so that every one could recognise Him as the Supreme Lord.
