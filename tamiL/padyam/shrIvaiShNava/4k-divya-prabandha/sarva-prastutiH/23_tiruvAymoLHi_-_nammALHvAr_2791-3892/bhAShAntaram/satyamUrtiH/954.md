**Tamil text and transliteration:**

உரையா வெம்நோய்தவிர அருள் நீள்முடியானை  
வரையார்மாடம் மன்னு குருகூர்ச் சடகோபன்  
உரையேய் சொல்தொடை ஓர்ஆயிரத்துள் இப்பத்தும்  
நிரையே வல்லார் நீடு உலகத்துப் பிறவாரே. (2)

uraiyā vemnōytavira aruḷ nīḷmuṭiyāṉai  
varaiyārmāṭam maṉṉu kurukūrc caṭakōpaṉ  
uraiyēy coltoṭai ōrāyirattuḷ ippattum  
niraiyē vallār nīṭu ulakattup piṟavārē. (2)

**English translation of verse 8.3.11:**

Those that learn well these songs ten,  
Out of the thousand divine songs of Caṭakōpaṉ,  
Hailing from Kurukūr with its castles tall,  
In adoration of the Lord wearing the crown tall.  
Who did his parlous fears about Him quell,  
Will never in this sprawling world be reborn.

**Notes:**

The benefit accruing from learning well this decad as set out above, is self-explanatory. It is, of course, not mere freedom from rebirth in this wretched land where there is none who would feel concerned about the Lord’s safety and well-being but also eternal enjoyment in Heaven where the whole lot of them are dedicated to the Lord’s well-being. As regards the reference in this song to the tall crown of the Sovereign Lord, here is a juicy interpretation furnished by a preceptor, named, Ammaṅki Ammāl:

“The Lord would appear to have nodded His crowned head, by way of assuring the Āḻvār about fulfilling his desire.” The fulfilment of the Āḻvār’s desire in this context, would mean exhibiting unto him the band of devotees who would attend on the Lord and do His behest, such as following Him, carrying His bow and arrows etc., thereby curing him of his erstwhile fears regarding the Lord’s loneliness, unaided and unattended.
