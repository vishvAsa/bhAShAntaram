காணுமாறுஅருளாய் என்றுஎன்றே கலங்கி கண்ணநீர் அலமர வினையேன்  
பேணுமாறுஎல்லாம் பேணி நின்பெயரே பிதற்றுமாறு அருள் எனக்கு அந்தோ  
காணுமாறு அருளாய் காகுத்தா! கண்ணா! தொண்டனேன் கற்பகக்கனியே  
பேணுவார் அமுதே! பெரிய தண்புனல்சூழ் பெருநிலம் எடுத்த பேராளா!

**English translation of verse 8.1.2:**

Agitated stands this sinner, [tears](/definition/tear#history "show tears definitions") flooding the eyes,  
(For, many a time did I call you, eager to behold  
Your Form exquisite), many a method did I adopt (which success defied)  
Your grace rests merely on my prattling Your names (bad luck) alas!  
Oh, Lord, You did, as Kākuttaṉ and Kaṇṇan, incarnate,  
You are unto this vassal the fruit of the wish-yielding [tree](/definition/tree#history "show tree definitions").  
Nectar of the devout, You did redeem, oh, Benefactor great.  
The big Earth from deep waters, cool, may You be visible unto me.

**Notes:**

No [doubt](/definition/doubt#history "show doubt definitions"), it is the Lord’s grace that makes the [Āḻvār](/definition/aḻvar#vaishnavism "show Āḻvār definitions") cry out for it all the time, till it actually descends on him, without indulging in any kind of aberration, egging him on to self-effort to induce His grace. An irrepressible longing for quick consummation, resulting from inordinate God-love, made an impatient Āḻvār attempt quite a few methods, aimed at acceleration of his union with the Lord but all these proved ineffective. And now, he does nothing more than mentioning the Lord’s names which again is, of course, due tot he Lord’s grace and stamps him out as one apart from the worldlings. But this is not enough and the Āḻvār [pines](/definition/pine#history "show pines definitions") for beholding the Lord’s bewitching Form and he invites Him to appear before him, even as He had come down as [Rāma](/definition/rama#vaishnavism "show Rāma definitions") and [Kṛṣṇa](/definition/krishna#vaishnavism "show Kṛṣṇa definitions"), in His incarnate Forms, making Himself visible to sages and shepherdesses and the inhabitants of the remote [forests](/definition/forest#history "show forests definitions"). Actually, the Lord has never been apart from Himself nor is He aware of those separated from Him; while the ‘[Nitya](/definition/nitya#vaishnavism "show Nitya definitions") [Sūrīs](/definition/suri#history "show Sūrīs definitions")’ (Ever-free angles) in [Heaven](/definition/heaven#history "show Heaven definitions"), His proximate attendants know no separation from the Lord, the ‘Nitya Samsarīs’, wallowing in worldly [life](/definition/life#history "show life definitions"), are totally oblivious of Him and are, therefore, not conscious of their separation from Him. The Āḻvār is the solitary soul, at this end pining for the Lord, unable to bear the pangs of separation from Him.
