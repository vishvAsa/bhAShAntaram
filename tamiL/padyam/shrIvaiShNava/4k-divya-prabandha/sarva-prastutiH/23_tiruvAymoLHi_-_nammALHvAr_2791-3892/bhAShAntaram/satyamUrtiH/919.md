**Tamil text and transliteration:**

காணுமாறுஅருளாய் என்றுஎன்றே கலங்கி கண்ணநீர் அலமர வினையேன்  
பேணுமாறுஎல்லாம் பேணி நின்பெயரே பிதற்றுமாறு அருள் எனக்கு அந்தோ  
காணுமாறு அருளாய் காகுத்தா! கண்ணா! தொண்டனேன் கற்பகக்கனியே  
பேணுவார் அமுதே! பெரிய தண்புனல்சூழ் பெருநிலம் எடுத்த பேராளா!

kāṇumāṟuaruḷāy eṉṟueṉṟē kalaṅki kaṇṇanīr alamara viṉaiyēṉ  
pēṇumāṟuellām pēṇi niṉpeyarē pitaṟṟumāṟu aruḷ eṉakku antō  
kāṇumāṟu aruḷāy kākuttā! kaṇṇā! toṇṭaṉēṉ kaṟpakakkaṉiyē  
pēṇuvār amutē! periya taṇpuṉalcūḻ perunilam eṭutta pērāḷā!

**English translation of verse 8.1.2:**

Agitated stands this sinner, tears flooding the eyes,  
(For, many a time did I call you, eager to behold  
Your Form exquisite), many a method did I adopt (which success defied)  
Your grace rests merely on my prattling Your names (bad luck) alas!  
Oh, Lord, You did, as Kākuttaṉ and Kaṇṇan, incarnate,  
You are unto this vassal the fruit of the wish-yielding tree.  
Nectar of the devout, You did redeem, oh, Benefactor great.  
The big Earth from deep waters, cool, may You be visible unto me.

**Notes:**

No doubt, it is the Lord’s grace that makes the Āḻvār cry out for it all the time, till it actually descends on him, without indulging in any kind of aberration, egging him on to self-effort to induce His grace. An irrepressible longing for quick consummation, resulting from inordinate God-love, made an impatient Āḻvār attempt quite a few methods, aimed at acceleration of his union with the Lord but all these proved ineffective. And now, he does nothing more than mentioning the Lord’s names which again is, of course, due tot he Lord’s grace and stamps him out as one apart from the worldlings. But this is not enough and the Āḻvār pines for beholding the Lord’s bewitching Form and he invites Him to appear before him, even as He had come down as Rāma and Kṛṣṇa, in His incarnate Forms, making Himself visible to sages and shepherdesses and the inhabitants of the remote forests. Actually, the Lord has never been apart from Himself nor is He aware of those separated from Him; while the ‘Nitya Sūrīs’ (Ever-free angles) in Heaven, His proximate attendants know no separation from the Lord, the ‘Nitya Samsarīs’, wallowing in worldly life, are totally oblivious of Him and are, therefore, not conscious of their separation from Him. The Āḻvār is the solitary soul, at this end pining for the Lord, unable to bear the pangs of separation from Him.
