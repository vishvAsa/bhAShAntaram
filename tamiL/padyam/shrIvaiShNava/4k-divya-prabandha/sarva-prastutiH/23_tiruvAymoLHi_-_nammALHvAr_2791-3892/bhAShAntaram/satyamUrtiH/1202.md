**Tamil text and transliteration:**

துடைத்த கோவிந்தனாரே உலகுஉயிர் தேவும்மற்றும்  
படைத்த எம்பரமமூர்த்தி பாம்பணைப் பள்ளிகொண்டான்  
மடைத்தலை வாளைபாயும் வயல்அணிஅனந்தபுரம்  
கடைத்தலை சீய்க்கப்பெற்றால் கடுவினை களையலாமே

tuṭaitta kōvintaṉārē ulakuuyir tēvummaṟṟum  
paṭaitta emparamamūrtti pāmpaṇaip paḷḷikoṇṭāṉ  
maṭaittalai vāḷaipāyum vayalaṇiaṉantapuram  
kaṭaittalai cīykkappeṟṟāl kaṭuviṉai kaḷaiyalāmē

**English translation of verse 10.2.7:**

Your deadly sins will get dissolved if you’d resort  
To Aṉantapuram. which fields fertile do adorn,  
And clean up the door-step of the temple where reclines  
On serpent-bed, the Lord Supreme who dissolved the worlds  
And then put them back into the respective folds.

**Notes:**

\(i\) The Āḻvār affirms that those, who render service unto the Lord reclining at Tiru-Aṉantapuram, will get rid of their age-long sins, however deadly they might be. Of the several kinds of service, prominence is given to cleaning up the temple gates and keeping the temple front, bright and tidy.

\(ii\) The wiping off of the worlds, that is, the Lord’s act of dissolution or destruction of the Sportive Universe, ‘Līlā Vibhūti’ is mentioned first and then the creation. This is because Vedāntas speak of dissolution first. As a matter of fact, the ‘Saṃsāra’ or the cycle of birth and rebirth is much-too-old and its beginning is just not known. The dissolution is but eating up all the worlds, with their contents and sustaining them all, inside the Lord’s stomach, from being swept off by the whirling waters of the Deluge. Creation is but spitting them out, at the end of the Deluge and putting things back in their respective folds.
