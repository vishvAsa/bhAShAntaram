**Tamil text and transliteration:**

மனிசரும் மற்றும் முற்றும் ஆய் மாயப் பிறவி பிறந்த,  
தனியன் பிறப்பிலி தன்னை தடங்கடல் சேர்ந்த பிரானை,  
கனியை கரும்பின் இன் சாற்றை கட்டியை தேனை அமுதை,  
முனிவு இன்றி ஏத்திக் குனிப்பார் முழுது உணர் நீர்மையினார.

maṉicarum maṟṟum muṟṟum āy māyap piṟavi piṟanta,  
taṉiyaṉ piṟappili taṉṉai taṭaṅkaṭal cērnta pirāṉai,  
kaṉiyai karumpiṉ iṉ cāṟṟai kaṭṭiyai tēṉai amutai,  
muṉivu iṉṟi ēttik kuṉippār muḻutu uṇar nīrmaiyiṉāra.

**English translation of verse 3.5.6:**

Perfect knowledge vests in those that dance  
And sing with great joy the glory of the Lord,  
The delicious fruit, candy, honey and Cane-juice,  
The nectar grand, reclining on the milk-ocean broad,  
Who, birthless though, did come down in many ways,  
Now as man, then as Deva and so on, wondrous and peerless.

**Notes**

\(i\) The Lord is birthless in the sense that He is not, by any means, involved like us, in the inevitable cycle of birth and rebirth, eking out the results of our good and bad actions. And yet, He incarnates many times and in many ways out of His own free will, assuming the form most appropriate to the particular occasion and purpose. Those who go into raptures in contemplation of these beneficent Avatāra of the highly delicious Lord, could indeed be deemed to have assimilated the quintessence of all learning.

\(ii\) *Reclining on the milk-ocean*: This refers to the ‘Vyūha’ aspect of the Lord reclining on the milky ocean, the centre of creative activity, where the Lord contem-plates the ways and means of reclaiming us all from the ocean of Saṃsāra—birth and bondage.

\(iii\) With all their massive learning, if people are not visibly moved by the Lord’s auspicious traits and do not take a deep plunge into them, they should indeed be deemed ignorant. On the other hand, those that are not conversant with any of the Śāstras but get into the region of ecstasy, entranced mentally, orally and physically, by the Lord’s auspicious traits and wondrous deeds, are virtually all-knowing.
