Easy worshippability apart, the Lord should also be adorable.. We see around quite a few persons whom it is easy to please but we don’t like to court as there is nothing attractive or prepossessing in them. This decad shows that the Lord is highly adorable because of His extraordinary sweetness. As Nampiḷḷai would have it, the Lord is adorable to such an extent that He grows envious of His devotees and wants to adore them, in turn, having Himself tasted the sweetness of adoration. In śloka ‘manujatva tiroitena.........’ of Pādukā Sahaśram, Śrī Vedānta Deśika observes that, unlike the previous Avatāras when the Lord came all alone, He assumed four forms when He came down as Śrī Rāma and the three younger brothers. The purpose behind this was to adore His own pair of sandals which have a high reputation of their own. This He did in His other form as Bharata. Had Rāma come alone, He couldn’t have achieved this purpose.
