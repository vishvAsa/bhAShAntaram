மேய்நிரை கீழ்புக மாபுரள, சுனை  
வாய்நிறை நீர் பிளிறிச்சொரிய, இன  
ஆநிரை பாடி அங்கேஒடுங்க, அப்பன்  
தீமழை காத்து குன்றம் எடுத்தானே

**English translation of verse 7.4.10:**

When ([Kṛṣṇa](/definition/krishna#vaishnavism "show Kṛṣṇa definitions")) my Sire, held the umbrella of a mountain  
And warded off ([Indra](/definition/indra#vaishnavism "show Indra definitions")’s) rain of destruction,  
The whole of [Āyppāṭi](/definition/ayppati#vaishnavism "show Āyppāṭi definitions"), the town fertile, remained under its protection,  
The grazing cattle just moved aside and carried on,  
The [beasts](/definition/beast#history "show beasts definitions") tumbled as the mount was held upside down  
And water from tankṣ, full to the brim, came gushing down.

**Notes:**

Here is a short and sweet picture, graphic enough, of Lord Kṛṣṇa’s mountain-lifting to protect a whole [township](/definition/township#history "show township definitions") and its cattle from the fury of Indra, which visited on them through a heavy down-pour of revengeful rains for a whole week. While the cattle grazed on undisturbed, moving a little down on the mountain slopes, the wild [animals](/definition/animal#history "show animals definitions"), caught unawares, tumbled down, as Śrī Kṛṣṇa held Mount Govardan upside down, like holding an umbrella. Again, the [tanks](/definition/tank#history "show tanks definitions") on the mountain slopes, full to the brim, got inverted and the waters discharged therefrom came down with roaring [noise](/definition/noise#history "show noise definitions"), like unto rain-fall from numerous belts, the phenomenon of a multiplicity of rains raised in the process of shielding the township from a single rain visited by the irate Indra. How magnanimous indeed of the Lord to have patiently held aloft a mountain for a whole week and spared Indra, a votary of His (unlike the inimical Asuras), despite the wrong done by him!
