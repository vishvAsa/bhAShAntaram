**Tamil text and transliteration:**

மேய்நிரை கீழ்புக மாபுரள, சுனை  
வாய்நிறை நீர் பிளிறிச்சொரிய, இன  
ஆநிரை பாடி அங்கேஒடுங்க, அப்பன்  
தீமழை காத்து குன்றம் எடுத்தானே

mēynirai kīḻpuka māpuraḷa, cuṉai  
vāyniṟai nīr piḷiṟiccoriya, iṉa  
ānirai pāṭi aṅkēoṭuṅka, appaṉ  
tīmaḻai kāttu kuṉṟam eṭuttāṉē

**English translation of verse 7.4.10:**

When (Kṛṣṇa) my Sire, held the umbrella of a mountain  
And warded off (Indra’s) rain of destruction,  
The whole of Āyppāṭi, the town fertile, remained under its protection,  
The grazing cattle just moved aside and carried on,  
The beasts tumbled as the mount was held upside down  
And water from tankṣ, full to the brim, came gushing down.

**Notes:**

Here is a short and sweet picture, graphic enough, of Lord Kṛṣṇa’s mountain-lifting to protect a whole township and its cattle from the fury of Indra, which visited on them through a heavy down-pour of revengeful rains for a whole week. While the cattle grazed on undisturbed, moving a little down on the mountain slopes, the wild animals, caught unawares, tumbled down, as Śrī Kṛṣṇa held Mount Govardan upside down, like holding an umbrella. Again, the tanks on the mountain slopes, full to the brim, got inverted and the waters discharged therefrom came down with roaring noise, like unto rain-fall from numerous belts, the phenomenon of a multiplicity of rains raised in the process of shielding the township from a single rain visited by the irate Indra. How magnanimous indeed of the Lord to have patiently held aloft a mountain for a whole week and spared Indra, a votary of His (unlike the inimical Asuras), despite the wrong done by him!
