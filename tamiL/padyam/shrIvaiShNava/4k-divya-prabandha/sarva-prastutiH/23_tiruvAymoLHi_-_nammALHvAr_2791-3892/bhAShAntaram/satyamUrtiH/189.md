The [sufferings](/definition/suffering#history "show sufferings definitions") undergone by the [Āḻvār](/definition/aḻvar#vaishnavism "show Āḻvār definitions"), as set out in the last decad, are comparable to the titanic struggle of [Gajendra](/definition/gajendra#vaishnavism "show Gajendra definitions"), the [elephant](/definition/elephant#history "show elephant definitions"), with the [crocodile](/definition/crocodile#history "show crocodile definitions"). Even as the Lord rushed, with an aching heart, to the pond post-haste on hearing the alarum raised by the elephant the Lord felt exceedingly remorseful that He did not rush to meet the Āḻvār as soon as the latter became critical of His nonchalance, that is, His not rushing to his aid despite His having the mighty [Garuḍa](/definition/garuda#vaishnavism "show Garuḍa definitions") to carry Him anywhere at supersonic speed. See II-4-4. By way of making amends for this remissness, the Lord has now come to the Āḻvār, in all His splendour and paraphernalia and is at the height of His joy in the blessed [company](/definition/company#history "show company definitions") of the Saint. Beholding the joyous Lord, the Saint feels immensely delighted and relates, in this decad, his ecstatic experience.
