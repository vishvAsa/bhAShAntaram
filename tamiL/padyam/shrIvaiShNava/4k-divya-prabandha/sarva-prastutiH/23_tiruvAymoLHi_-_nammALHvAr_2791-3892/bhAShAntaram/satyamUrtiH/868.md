**[Tamil](/definition/tamil#history "show Tamil definitions") text and transliteration:**

என்றும் நின்றேதிகழும் செய்ய ஈன்சுடர் வெண்மின்னுக்கொல்,  
அன்றி என்ஆவிஅடும் அணி முத்தம்கொலோ? அறியேன்,  
குன்றம் எடுத்தபிரான் முறுவல் எனதுஆவிஅடும்  
ஒன்றும் அறிகின்றிலேன் அன்னைமீர்! எனக்கு உய்வுஇடமே

eṉṟum niṉṟētikaḻum ceyya īṉcuṭar veṇmiṉṉukkol,  
aṉṟi eṉāviaṭum aṇi muttamkolō? aṟiyēṉ,  
kuṉṟam eṭuttapirāṉ muṟuval eṉatuāviaṭum  
oṉṟum aṟikiṉṟilēṉ aṉṉaimīr! eṉakku uyvuiṭamē

**English translation of verse 7.7.5:**

I just don’t know whether it is the lightning white  
That stays and reveals the radiance red or [pearls](/definition/pearl#history "show pearls definitions") white,  
In a cluster that does my [life](/definition/life#history "show life definitions") [torment](/definition/torment#history "show torment definitions"); well, these smiles  
Of the Lord, Who lifted mount (Govardhan [[Govardhana](/definition/govardhana#vaishnavism "show Govardhana definitions")]) aloft, do scorch my soul,  
Oh, Elders, see I can’t how I can survive at all.

**Notes:**

The Lord’s smiles are likened to the lightning, with this difference that unlike lightning which is seem during a split second, the lightning smiles of the lord stay on and reveal the radiance of His red lips on which they keep [dancing](/definition/dancing#history "show dancing definitions"). The smiles are also likened to white pearls. The [Āḻvār](/definition/aḻvar#vaishnavism "show Āḻvār definitions") seems to have currently on view the smiles on Lord [Kṛṣṇa](/definition/krishna#vaishnavism "show Kṛṣṇa definitions")’s lips when He was holding Mount Govardhana aloft. But then, there a whole [township](/definition/township#history "show township definitions") took shelter but poor Nāyakī cannot find a single spot where she can take shelter and escape from the current oppression. Speaking about the Lord’s smiles, Śrī Nampiḷḷai admirably elucidates that they [dance](/definition/dance#history "show dance definitions") on His lips and are thus virtually at the entrance of the lips; they should, as such, have been dealt with first and the lips thereafter. The smiles, therefore, oppress the Nāyakī, now, resenting, as it were, their relegation from the natural order.
