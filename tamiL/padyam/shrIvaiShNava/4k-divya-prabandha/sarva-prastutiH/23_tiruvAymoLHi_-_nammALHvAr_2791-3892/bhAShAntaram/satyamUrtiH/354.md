**Tamil text and transliteration:**

பெருமக்கள் உள்ளவர் தம் பெருமானை, அமரர்கட்கு  
அருமை ஒழிய அன்று ஆர் அமுது ஊட்டிய அப்பனை,  
பெருமை பிதற்ற வல்லாரைப் பிதற்றும் அவர் கண்டீர்,  
வருமையும் இம்மையும் நம்மை அளிக்கும் பிராக்களே.

perumakkaḷ uḷḷavar tam perumāṉai, amararkaṭku  
arumai oḻiya aṉṟu ār amutu ūṭṭiya appaṉai,  
perumai pitaṟṟa vallāraip pitaṟṟum avar kaṇṭīr,  
varumaiyum immaiyum nammai aḷikkum pirākkaḷē.

**English translation of verse 3.7.5:**

They that do with ecstatic incoherence utter  
The glory great of the Sire who once fed in full  
The Devas with ambrosia, Chief of the exalted Celestials.  
Are indeed our saviours grand, both here and hereafter.

**Notes**

\(i\) *Chief of the exaḻted Celestials*: The *Nityasūris* (ever free angels in heaven) stand on a high pedestal of their own and the Lord, as their Chief, is higher than the highest.

\(ii\) The Devas sought from the Lord the ambrosia in order to become deathless. No doubt, the Lord felt very much that the Devas should have been so short-sighted and under-evolved as to seek from Him a mere extract from the ocean instead of straightaway coveting Him, the insatiable Nectar, the inexhaustible fountain of bliss. And yet, it was some consolation for Him that they didn’t seek this favour, inferior though, from any one else. How generous of Him indeed that He took all the trouble to churn the ocean and get them what they wanted! Those that are lost in admiration of the great souls who recognise and adore this act of grace on the part of the Lord, are deemed by the Āḻvār as his benefactors, the masters, who alone can salve him, here and hereafter in this land by keeping him aloof from the Ungodly and, in the yonder heaven, by putting him on to the eternal service of Lord Śrīman Nārāyaṇa.
