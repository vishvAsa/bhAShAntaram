**Tamil text and transliteration:**

நின்றனர் இருந்தனர் கிடந்தனர் திரிந்தனர்  
நின்றிலர் இருந்திலர் கிடந்திலர் திரிந்திலர்  
என்றும் ஓர் இயல்வினர் என நினைவு அரியவர்  
என்றும் ஓர் இயல்வொடு நின்ற எம் திடரே.

niṉṟaṉar iruntaṉar kiṭantaṉar tirintaṉar  
niṉṟilar iruntilar kiṭantilar tirintilar  
eṉṟum ōr iyalviṉar eṉa niṉaivu ariyavar  
eṉṟum ōr iyalvoṭu niṉṟa em tiṭarē.

**English translation of verse 1.1.6:**

We have it on the firm authority of the Vedas, that it is our Supreme Lord, who controls and sustains the different postures of standing, sitting, lying and wandering about, of one and all, as well as their abstinance therefrom, Himself being immutable (undergoing no change whatsoever) and yet beyond specific scrutiny and comprehension.

**Notes**

\(i\) In stanzas 4 and 5, the Supreme Lord was shown to be the Sole Architect and Sustainer of the created world of differences (*līlā vibhūti*) and now, in this stanza, He is declared to be the cause of motion as well as rest—‘*pravṛtti*’ as well as ‘*nivṛtti*’.

\(ii\) To a poser whether God, on Whom all our actions or motions are said to be dependent, is again required to bring our activity to rest, Empār replied in the affirmative and brought home the point by citing the example of sage Viśvāmitra, who had pushed King ‘Triśaṅku’, bodily, on to *Svarga*, arresting his fall therefrom and making him stay mid-way in the process.
