**Tamil text and transliteration:**

போரவிட்டிட்டு என்னை நீபுறம்போக்கலுற்றால் பின்னையான்-  
ஆரைக்கொண்டு எத்தைஅந்தோ! எனதுஎன்பதுஎன்? யான்என்பதுஎன்?  
தீர இரும்புஉண்ட நீரதுபோல என்ஆர்உயிரை-  
ஆரப்பருக எனக்கு ஆராஅமுதுஆனாயே.

pōraviṭṭiṭṭu eṉṉai nīpuṟampōkkaluṟṟāl piṉṉaiyāṉ-  
āraikkoṇṭu ettaiantō! eṉatueṉpatueṉ? yāṉeṉpatueṉ?  
tīra irumpuuṇṭa nīratupōla eṉāruyirai-  
ārapparuka eṉakku ārāamutuāṉāyē.

**English translation of verse 10.10.5:**

You are unto me the nectar insatiable,  
That does fully quench my God-thirst abnormal,  
Like the red-hot iron having its fill, jolly well,  
When dipped in water and yet if You, my Lord,  
Gave me up and kept me aside, [in sensual pleasures buried,]  
What can this frail being achieve and by what means?  
Alas! what am I and what is mine?

**Notes:**

\(i\) The Āḻvār deplores his sad plight; he feels that he has been woefully despised by the Lord, despite His role as the great Universal Protector and His omnipotence, reducing him to the unenviable predicament in which he finds himself nowhere. Neglected by the Lord, the Āḻvār betrays his utter helplessness, neither he nor any one else can help him. And so, he feels done up.

\(ii\) Even as the red-hot iron, dipped in water, drinks all that water, needed to cool it down effectively, the Lord exhibited His exquisite charm to the Āḻvār, so as to entice his soul and consume it, in full.
