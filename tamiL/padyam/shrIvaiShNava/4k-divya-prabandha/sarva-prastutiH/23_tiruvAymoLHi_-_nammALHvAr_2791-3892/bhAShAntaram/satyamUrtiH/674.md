பிணக்கி யாவையும் யாவரும் பிழையாமல் பேதித்தும் பேதியாதது ஓர்  
கணக்கு இல் கீர்த்தி வெள்ளக் கதிர் ஞான மூர்த்தியினாய்,  
இணக்கி எம்மை எம் தோழிமார் விளையாடப் போதுமின் என்னப் போந்தோமை  
உணக்கி நீ வளைத்தால் என் சொல்லார் உகவாதவரே?

**English translation of verse 6.2.8:**

Oh, Sire. You are the embodiment of all that knowledge radiant,  
You keep without name and form all things sentient and non-sentient  
At the time of dissolution and at creation You do sort them out  
And put the [species](/definition/species#history "show species definitions") back in their spheres, clear and cogent;  
(We knew not You’d be here) our mates brought us for play,  
If You hugged us close, what would the unfriendly say?

#### Note

When the [Gopīs](/definition/gopi#vaishnavism "show Gopīs definitions") threatened to get Śrī [Kṛṣṇa](/definition/krishna#vaishnavism "show Kṛṣṇa definitions") beaten, He took up the challenge and shouted at them. The Gopīs coolly told Him, they had known all about Him and there was no need for Him to make all that fuss. When called upon by Him to cite what exactly they had known about Him, they stated, as in the first four [lines](/definition/line#history "show lines definitions") of this stanza. Śrī Kṛṣṇa then questioned them how, despite all that knowledge they dared to get Him belaboured and elicited the reply that one so great, should not meddle with those frail little girls who had come there to play, not knowing that He would also be there. There was a vast gulf of difference between His play and theirs. His was the creation, sustentation and dissolution of the Sportive Universe ([Līlā](/definition/lila#vaishnavism "show Līlā definitions") [Vibhūti](/definition/vibhuti#vaishnavism "show Vibhūti definitions")) whereas they were engaged in simple games, with balls and dolls. Śrī Kṛṣṇa was asked to go His own way, leaving them alone, free to go on with their play. So saying, the Gopīs were about to withdraw themselves but Śrī Kṛṣṇa intercepted them and would not allow them to retreat. The Gopīs remonstrated that, if He encircled and hugged them, personally they had nothing to say, but it was likely to be criticised by the unfriendly spectators around, not aware of the intimate, indissoluble bond that subsists between the individual souls and the Super-Soul. It is here, the Gopīs gave out their real mind, hitherto concealed by their rough exterior.
