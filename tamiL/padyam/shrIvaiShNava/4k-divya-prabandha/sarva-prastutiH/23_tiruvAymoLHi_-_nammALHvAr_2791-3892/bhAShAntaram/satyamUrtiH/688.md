**Tamil text and transliteration:**

என் அப்பன் எனக்கு ஆய் இகுள் ஆய் என்னைப் பெற்றவள் ஆய்  
பொன் அப்பன் மணி அப்பன் முத்து அப்பன் அன் அப்பனும் ஆய்  
மின்னப் பொன் மதிள் சூழ் திருவிண்ணகர் சேர்ந்த அப்பன்  
தன் ஒப்பார் இல் அப்பன் தந்தனன் தன தாள் நிழலே. (2)

eṉ appaṉ eṉakku āy ikuḷ āy eṉṉaip peṟṟavaḷ āy  
poṉ appaṉ maṇi appaṉ muttu appaṉ aṉ appaṉum āy  
miṉṉap poṉ matiḷ cūḻ tiruviṇṇakar cērnta appaṉ  
taṉ oppār il appaṉ tantaṉaṉ taṉa tāḷ niḻalē. (2)

**English translation of verse 6.3.9:**

The peerless Lord Who unto me is Father, Mate and Mother,  
All combined, my Sire, like gold, ruby and pearl put together,  
Stays in Tiruviṇṇakar with its golden ramparts all around,  
Me, He has under the cool shade of His feet grounded.

#### Notes

\(i\) The great Sages have proclaimed: “Vāsudeva tharucchāyā nāthi śīthā na gharmadhā...,” that is, the shade of Vāsudeva, the gigantic tree, is most soothing and refreshing, it prevents entry into hell and is, therefore, worth getting into. Such a shade has been granted to Saint Nammāḻvār by the Lord of His own accord in His spontaneous Grace. This great benefaction of the Lord is being extolled by the Saint in this song. By the shade of the Lord is actually meant service unto Him in His immediate presence.

\(ii\) In the world around, the Father is distinct from the Mother and the Mother is distinct from the Mate. The combination of all these different functionaries in one and the same person, is not possible except in God Who is unique in all respects. So also, Gold serves a certain purpose, the ruby serves yet another purpose and the peari, a third, but one can secure all these benefits from the Lord alone, who is ‘All in one’.
