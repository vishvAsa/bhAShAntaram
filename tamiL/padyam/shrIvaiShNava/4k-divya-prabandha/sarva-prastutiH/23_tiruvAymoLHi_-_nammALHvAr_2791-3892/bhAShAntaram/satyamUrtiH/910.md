**Tamil text and transliteration:**

அன்றி மற்று ஒன்று இலம் நின்சரணே! என்று அகல் இரும் பொய்கையின்வாய்,  
நின்று தன் நீள் கழல் ஏத்திய ஆனையின் நெஞ்சு இடர் தீர்த்த பிரான்,  
சென்று அங்கு இனிது உறைகின்ற செழும் பொழில் சூழ் திருவாறன்விளை,  
ஒன்றி வலஞ்செய்ய ஒன்றுமோ? தீவினை உள்ளத்தின் சார்வு அல்லவே.

aṉṟi maṟṟu oṉṟu ilam niṉcaraṇē! eṉṟu akal irum poykaiyiṉvāy,  
niṉṟu taṉ nīḷ kaḻal ēttiya āṉaiyiṉ neñcu iṭar tīrtta pirāṉ,  
ceṉṟu aṅku iṉitu uṟaikiṉṟa ceḻum poḻil cūḻ tiruvāṟaṉviḷai,  
oṉṟi valañceyya oṉṟumō? tīviṉai uḷḷattiṉ cārvu allavē.

**English translation of verse 7.10.8:**

Were it possible to visit and go round  
Tiruvāṟaṇviḷai, by lovely gardens surrounded.  
Where lovingly resides the Lord, Who the deep distress relieved  
Of the Elephant in the pond huge, who his faith did pin  
On His lovely feet, squeeze we can from our hearts all sins.

**Notes:**

The Lord, who rid Gajendra, the pious elephant, of dire distress, and now stays in Tiruvāṟaṉviḷai, will certainly cure us of all ills and evils. With its leg right in the jaws of the tough crocodile, the elephant was engaged in a titanic struggle for years, trying to extricate himself from the monster. When this self-effort, grim and long, proved not only abortive but turned out to be a hindrance to the influx of the Lord’s grace, the great devotee that the elephant was, he looked upon the Lord as the Sole Saviour and deliverance followed. The elephant was not in the least bothered about its own emaciation and eventual dissolution but its sole concern was to offer the lotus flower plucked by it, at such a heavy cost and still held in its trunk, at the feet of the Supreme Lord. What distressed the elephant even more, was his deep concern that the Lord’s reputation as the Sole Saviour should not get tarnished by His not coming down to his rescue. It is precisely this, that has been referred to in this song, as the deep distress of the elephant. And so, the Lord feels benefited by the elephant, helping Him to redeem His reputation as the Sole Saviour of His subjects. This great trait of Lord Mahāviṣṇu of identifying Himself as the recipient of a favour when He is actually conferring one on His devotees and feeling distressed over the miseries of His subjects even more than they do, is inherited by His devotees. A true Vaiṣṇava (a votary of Lord Viṣṇu) is, therefore, one who possessed this remarkable trait.
