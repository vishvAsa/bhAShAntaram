**Tamil text and transliteration:**

வேயின் மலிபுரை தோளி பின்னைக்கு மணாளனை,  
ஆய பெரும்புகழ் எல்லை இலாதன பாடிப்போய்,  
காயம் கழித்து அவன் தாள் இணைக்கீழ்ப் புகும் காதலன்,  
மாய மனிசரை என் சொல்ல வல்லேன் என் வாய்கொண்டே?

vēyiṉ malipurai tōḷi piṉṉaikku maṇāḷaṉai,  
āya perumpukaḻ ellai ilātaṉa pāṭippōy,  
kāyam kaḻittu avaṉ tāḷ iṇaikkīḻp pukum kātalaṉ,  
māya maṉicarai eṉ colla vallēṉ eṉ vāykoṇṭē?

**English translation of verse 3.9.8:**

With passion deep to sing the limitless glory of the consort  
Of Piṉṉai with shoulders pretty, for a long, long time  
And then discard my body and attain His lovely feet,  
Shall my tongue praise, at all, men in mundane moorings?

**Notes**

\(i\) Even as the Lord cut out the impediments in the way of attaining the charming Nappiṉṉai, He destroyed all the obstacles confronting the Āḻvār in attaining Him. When, at last, the material body is shaken off, the Āḻvār will acquire non-physical (*ultra*-mundane) body and serve the Lord, staying at His feet all the time. How could such a one ever think of singing the praise of the miserable mortals caught up in the mesh of mundane life?

\(ii\) The Lord's glory is unlimited and it can bear any amount of lauding for any length of time. Such being the case, there is hardly any scope for turning one’s attention on others. Even if the Āḻvār be inclined to sing the praise of others, his tongue would not be a party to it.
