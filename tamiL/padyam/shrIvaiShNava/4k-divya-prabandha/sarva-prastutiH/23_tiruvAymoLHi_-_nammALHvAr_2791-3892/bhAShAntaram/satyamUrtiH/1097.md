**Tamil text and transliteration:**

உருவாகிய ஆறுசமயங்கட்குஎல்லாம்  
பொருவாகி நின்றான் அவன் எல்லாப்பொருட்கும்  
அருவாகிய ஆதியை தேவர்கட்குஎல்லாம்  
கருவாகிய கண்ணனை கண்டுகொண்டேனே.

uruvākiya āṟucamayaṅkaṭkuellām  
poruvāki niṉṟāṉ avaṉ ellāpporuṭkum  
aruvākiya ātiyai tēvarkaṭkuellām  
karuvākiya kaṇṇaṉai kaṇṭukoṇṭēṉē.

**English translation of verse 9.4.8:**

Perceive and enjoy do I Kaṇṇaṉ, the Primate,  
The sole Sustainer of all lives, the Progenitor great,  
Of the Devas, well beyond the mischief of the heresies  
Of the six alien systems of philosophy.

**Notes:**

\(i\) The omnipotent Lord can surely preserve Himself from the onslaught of the heretical doctrines like those of Cārvākas, Jains, Buddhists, Vaiśeṣikas, Śāṅkhyas and Pāśupadhas, denying His very existence. These systems do not admit the authority of the Vedas.

\(ii\) The Lord is the great Ordainer, being the first Cause of all things and the sole Sustainer of all souls, as their Internal Controller, residing in all things and beings.

\(iii\) The love-intoxicated Āḻvār could envisage Lord Kṛṣṇa, a by-gone Avatāra, as if he was a contemporary of His. The impious like Śiśupāla could not, however, perceive the Lord in His true Form, even though the Lord, in His incarnate Form, was in their midst.
