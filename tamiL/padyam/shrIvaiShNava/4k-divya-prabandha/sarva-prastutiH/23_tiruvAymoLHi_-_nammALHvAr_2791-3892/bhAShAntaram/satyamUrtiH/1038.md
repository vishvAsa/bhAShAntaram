**Tamil text and transliteration:**

இங்கே திரிந்தேற்கு இழுக்குஉற்றுஎன்! இருமாநிலம் முன்உண்டுஉமிழ்ந்த  
செங்கோலத்த பவளவாய்ச் செந்தாமரைக்கண் என்அம்மான்  
பொங்குஏழ் புகழ்கள் வாயவாய் புலன்கொள் வடிவு என்மனத்ததாய்  
அங்குஏய் மலர்கள் கையவாய் வழிபட்டுஓட அருளிலே?

iṅkē tirintēṟku iḻukkuuṟṟueṉ! irumānilam muṉuṇṭuumiḻnta  
ceṅkōlatta pavaḷavāyc centāmaraikkaṇ eṉammāṉ  
poṅkuēḻ pukaḻkaḷ vāyavāy pulaṉkoḷ vaṭivu eṉmaṉattatāy  
aṅkuēy malarkaḷ kaiyavāy vaḻipaṭṭuōṭa aruḷilē?

**English translation of verse 8.10.4:**

What would be wrong indeed, if I abjured heaven  
And stayed on, in this abode, my tongue spelt out  
The radiant glory of the lotus-eyed Lord with lovely lips, who gulped down  
All the worlds once and then spat them out,  
I did in my heart implant His form exquisite  
And my hands worshipped Him with choice flowers,  
In the foot-steps of His devotees of great fervour?

**Notes:**

It is but meet that the ‘carama parva niṣṭā’, that is, one who adores the Lord’s devotees much to the delight of the Lord, should adore Him also for the gratification of the devotees. Matura Kavi Āḻvār, who knew no God other than Parāṅkuśa (Nammāḻvār), said, in the third stanza of ‘Kaṇṇiṇuṇ Ciṟuttāmpu,’, that there was nothing wrong in his adoring the cloud-hued Lord, for the delectation of Nammāḻvār, His staunch devotee. That song of his would appear to have been inspired only by this song of his master. The Āḻvār’s tongue, which should sing the glory of the Lord’s devotees, now sings His praise; his mind, where the devotees are to be enshrined, now holds the Lord and his hands which should offer flowers at the feet of the great apostles of the Lord, now place those flowers at His lovely feet. This does not, however, constitute any deviation from his arrowed stance of being the vassal of His devotees (Bhāgavata śeṣatva). Verily, it. is but an extension of that, directed towards the pleasure of those devotees themselves, c.f. Śatrugna’s devotion to Śrī Rāma, as but a corollary to the former’s devotion to Bharata, by-on-means detracting from it. See also the elucidation in aphorism 127 of ‘Acārya Hṛdayam’.
