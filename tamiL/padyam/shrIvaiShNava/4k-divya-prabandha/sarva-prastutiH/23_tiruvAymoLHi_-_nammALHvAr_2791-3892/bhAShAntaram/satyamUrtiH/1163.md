**Tamil text and transliteration:**

ஊதும் அத்தீம்குழற்கே உய்யேன்நான்! அதுமொழிந்துஇடை இடைதன் செய்கோலத்  
தூதுசெய் கண்கள் கொண்டுஒன்று பேசி தூமொழி இசைகள் கொண்டு ஒன்றுநோக்கி  
பேதுறு முகம்செய்து நொந்துநொந்து பேதைநெஞ்சுஅறவுஅறப் பாடும்பாட்டை  
யாதும்ஒன்று அறிகிலம் அம்மஅம்ம! மாலையும்வந்தது மாயன்வாரான்.

ūtum attīmkuḻaṟkē uyyēṉnāṉ! atumoḻintuiṭai iṭaitaṉ ceykōlat  
tūtucey kaṇkaḷ koṇṭuoṉṟu pēci tūmoḻi icaikaḷ koṇṭu oṉṟunōkki  
pētuṟu mukamceytu nontunontu pētaineñcuaṟavuaṟap pāṭumpāṭṭai  
yātumoṉṟu aṟikilam ammaamma! mālaiyumvantatu māyaṉvārāṉ.

**English translation of verse 9.9.9:**

I can’t but succumb to the haunting melody of that pipe  
That does His amorous advances convey, now and then;  
His tell-tale eyes do His message speak with unique get-up,  
His tuneful songs do glances throw and His deep concern  
For girls with aching heart, His face reveals,  
The songs He sings, anxious to put them at ease,  
We hardly know; alas! evening has come  
But the wondrous one is yet to come.

**Notes:**

It is the enchanting melody of Kṛṣṇa’s flute, interspersed with significant statements, now and then, that disarms the Gopīs and makes them resile from the determined stand previously taken by them, not to mix with Him any longer. The Lord speaks through His eyes and sees through His tuneful songs. He is wondrous, in the sense, that even those, who were averse to Him, while in a state of desolation due to separation from Him, would feel remorseful for their erstwhile unrelenting attitude towards Him, when He eventually comes and mingles with them. So freely does He mingle with His devotees and, in the process, exhibit amazing simplicity.
