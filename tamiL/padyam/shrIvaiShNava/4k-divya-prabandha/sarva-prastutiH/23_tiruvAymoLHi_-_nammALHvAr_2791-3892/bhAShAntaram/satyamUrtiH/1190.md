**Tamil text and transliteration:**

துயர்கெடும் கடிதுஅடைந்து வந்து அடியவர் தொழுமின்  
உயர்கொள் சோலை ஒண்தடம் மணிஒளி திருமோகூர்  
பெயர்கள் ஆயிரம்உடைய வல்லரக்கர் புக்குஅழுந்த  
தயரதன் பெற்ற மரகத மணித் தடத்தினையே.

tuyarkeṭum kaṭituaṭaintu vantu aṭiyavar toḻumiṉ  
uyarkoḷ cōlai oṇtaṭam maṇioḷi tirumōkūr  
peyarkaḷ āyiramuṭaiya vallarakkar pukkuaḻunta  
tayarataṉ peṟṟa marakata maṇit taṭattiṉaiyē.

**English translation of verse 10.1.8:**

Ye, devotees, all your miseries shall, in no time, disappear  
If you’d come and worship the Tank, studded with sapphire.  
King Tayarataṉ did yield, where the fell Rakṣasas, who bore  
A thousand names, met their inglorious end,  
Our Sire Who dwells in Tirumōkūr, with stately gardens and lovely ponds.

**Notes:**

\(i\) Pond inside the temple at Tirumōkūr as well as outside! The ponds, outside the temple precincts, are studded with lotus while the Lord, enshrined within, looks like yet another such lotus pond, what with His complexion resembling the lotus leaf, His eyes and lips, hands and

feet, looking like the red lotus in fresh bloom. Śrī Rāma, the valiant son of King Daśaratha, is figuratively likened to a tank studded with blue gems (sapphire), the hot bed of destruction of the dastardly Rākṣasas. Tanks are beneficial to those who seek to bathe therein or slake their thirst. There are, however, some who fall into them and commit suicide. It is significant that the Lord did not, on His own, destroy the Asuras and Rākṣasas but they courted disaster and met their ignominious end at the hands of the Lord, like unto the winged caterpillars rushing to the burning lamps and getting roasted to death, in large numbers.

\(ii\) If the Lord earned a thousand names by. virtue of His benevolence, so did the Rākṣasas too, by dint of their cruelty, such as “Yajña Śatru”, “Brahma Śatru” etc.
