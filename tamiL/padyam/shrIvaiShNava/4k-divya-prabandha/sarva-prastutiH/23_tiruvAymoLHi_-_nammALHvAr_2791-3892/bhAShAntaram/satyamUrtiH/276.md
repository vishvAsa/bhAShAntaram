**[Tamil](/definition/tamil#history "show Tamil definitions") text and transliteration:**

வருந்தாத அரும்தவத்த மலர் கதிரின் சுடர் உடம்பு ஆய்,  
வருந்தாத ஞானம் ஆய் வரம்பு இன்றி முழுது இயன்றாய்,  
வரும் காலம் நிகழ் காலம் கழி காலம் ஆய், உலகை  
ஒருங்காக அளிப்பாய் சீர் எங்கு உலக்க ஓதுவனே?

varuntāta arumtavatta malar katiriṉ cuṭar uṭampu āy,  
varuntāta ñāṉam āy varampu iṉṟi muḻutu iyaṉṟāy,  
varum [kālam](/definition/kalam#history "show kālam definitions") nikaḻ kālam [kaḻi](/definition/kali#history "show kaḻi definitions") kālam āy, ulakai  
oruṅkāka aḷippāy cīr eṅku ulakka ōtuvaṉē?

**English translation of verse 3.1.5:**

Your resplendent form you assume at your volition sweet,  
The result perhaps of your devotees’ penance great;  
Knowledge supreme is yours with no effort,  
Pervading without limits, the worlds you duly protect,  
Time is at your beck and call, past, present  
And future, how can I, your attributes fully relate?

**Note**

The preceding stanza (3-1-4) stands in isolation; in the midst of his enjoyment of Lord Aḻakar, the [Āḻvār](/definition/aḻvar#vaishnavism "show Āḻvār definitions")’s heart leapt towards the straying humanity and deplored their failure, rather their inability to feast on the exquisite charm of Aḻakar. This song has, therefore, to be studied in continuation of the third stanza where the Āḻvār had said” Oh, Kovindā, how can I describe your attributes?” The Lord rebuts the Āḻvār’s plea of inability, despite his supreme knowledge. Here then is the Āḻvār’s elucidation of his limitations, despite all that massive knowledge, dowered on him by the Lord whose glory, however, knows no bounds and cannot, therefore, be fully comprehended and expressed by any one. As a matter of fact, complete enumeration of the Lord’s glory, His auspicious traits etc, would be possible, only if they remained encompassed by known limits.
