நாயகன் முழு ஏழ் உலகுக்கும் ஆய் முழு ஏழ் உலகும், தன்  
வாயகம் புக வைத்து உமிழ்ந்து அவை ஆய் அவை அல்லனும் ஆம்,  
கேசவன் அடி இணைமிசைக் குருகூர்ச் சடகோபன் சொன்ன  
தூய ஆயிரத்து இப்பத்தால் பத்தர் ஆவர் துவள் இன்றியே.

nāyakaṉ muḻu ēḻ ulakukkum āy muḻu ēḻ ulakum, taṉ  
vāyakam puka vaittu umiḻntu avai āy avai allaṉum ām,  
kēcavaṉ aṭi iṇaimicaik kurukūrc [caṭakōpaṉ](/definition/catakopan#vaishnavism "show caṭakōpaṉ definitions") coṉṉa  
tūya āyirattu ippattāl pattar āvar tuvaḷ iṉṟiyē.

**English translation of verse 6.4.11:**

Those that learn these songs ten, out of the immaculate thousand  
Composed by Caṭakōpaṉ of [Kurukūr](/definition/kurukur#vaishnavism "show Kurukūr definitions"), adoring the lovely pair of feet  
Of Kēcavaṉ, the Lord Supreme of the entire Universe Who sustained  
All the worlds in His stomach and then spat them out,  
Who pervades them all and would all the same  
From them remain apart, will blemishless devotees become.

#### Notes

\(i\) *Blemishless devotees*: Those that learn these songs will be exclusively devoted to Lord [Kṛṣṇa](/definition/krishna#vaishnavism "show Kṛṣṇa definitions"), like Saint [Nammāḻvār](/definition/nammalvar#vaishnavism "show Nammāḻvār definitions"). It is this exclusive devotion like unto that of Toṇṭaraṭippoṭi [Āḻvār](/definition/aḻvar#vaishnavism "show Āḻvār definitions") for the holy [Śrīraṅgam](/definition/shrirangam#vaishnavism "show Śrīraṅgam definitions"), that the word ‘blemishless’ connotes.

\(ii\) *The immaculate thousand*: Contrary to his prefatory resolve to write out [Śrī Rāma](/definition/shrirama#history "show Śrī Rāma definitions")’s [life](/definition/life#history "show life definitions") story, Śrī [Vālmīki](/definition/valmiki#vaishnavism "show Vālmīki definitions") introduced quite a few extraneous anecdotes, such as the genesis of Gangā, [birth](/definition/birth#history "show birth definitions") of Kārthikeya and so on. Likewise, Sage [Vyāsa](/definition/vyasa#vaishnavism "show Vyāsa definitions") made no secret of his intention to tell the story of Lord [Nārāyaṇa](/definition/narayana#vaishnavism "show Nārāyaṇa definitions") but got terribly discursive and literally turned his [Mahābhārata](/definition/mahabharata#vaishnavism "show Mahābhārata definitions") into a war-memoir, with a bewildering maze of episodes, inter-twined and inter-locked. On the other hand, true to his resolve in ‘[Tiruviruttam](/definition/tiruviruttam#vaishnavism "show Tiruviruttam definitions")’, the first of his four works, that he would sing the praise of ‘Tirumāl’ ([Mahā Viṣṇu](/definition/mahavishnu#vaishnavism "show Mahā Viṣṇu definitions")) and nothing but that, *Nammāḻvār kept up the tempo throughout, uninterrupted by anything else* and thus his works became the cream of the whole compendium of ‘[Divya](/definition/divya#vaishnavism "show Divya definitions") Prabhandham’, even as ‘[Puruṣa Sūktaṃ](/definition/purusha-sukta#vaishnavism "show Puruṣa Sūktaṃ definitions")’ gets the [pride](/definition/pride#history "show pride definitions") of place among the Vedas, ‘[Manu](/definition/manu#vaishnavism "show Manu definitions") [Smṛti](/definition/smriti#vaishnavism "show Smṛti definitions")’, among the [Dharma Śāstras](/definition/dharmashastra#history "show Dharma Śāstras definitions"), ‘[Bhagavad Gītā](/definition/bhagavad-gita#vaishnavism "show Bhagavad Gītā definitions")’ in Mahābhārata and ‘[Viṣṇu](/definition/vishnu#vaishnavism "show Viṣṇu definitions") [Purāṇa](/definition/purana#vaishnavism "show Purāṇa definitions")’, among the [Purāṇas](/definition/purana#vaishnavism "show Purāṇas definitions"). Thus ‘[Tiruvāymoḻi](/definition/tiruvaymoli#vaishnavism "show Tiruvāymoḻi definitions")’ is *pure and unalloyed*.
