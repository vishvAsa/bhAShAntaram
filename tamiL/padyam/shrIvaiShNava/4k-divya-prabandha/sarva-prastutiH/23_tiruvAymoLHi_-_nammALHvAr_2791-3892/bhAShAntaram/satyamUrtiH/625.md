A frustrated Āḻvār turns his attention on yet another pilgrim centre, named Tiruvallavāḻ (in Kerala), the coveted communion with the Lord at Tirukkuṭantai not having materialised. Even so, he couldn’t get there, being obsessed with the fragrance wafted across from there along with the breeze, the musical drone of the bees humming in the orchards over there, the vedic chantings etc. Thus stranded, *en route*, the Āḻvār assumes the state of Nāyakī who speaks out her infatuation to her mates. Of course, it is all mental experience and no physical movement, as such, is involved.
