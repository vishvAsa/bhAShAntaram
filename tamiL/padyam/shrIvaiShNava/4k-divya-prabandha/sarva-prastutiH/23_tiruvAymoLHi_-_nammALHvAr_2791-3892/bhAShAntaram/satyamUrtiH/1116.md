**Tamil text and transliteration:**

உருகுமால் நெஞ்சம் உயிரின் பரமன்றி  
பெருகுமால் வேட்கையும் என்செய்கேன் தொண்டனேன்  
தெருவுஎல்லாம் காவிகமழ் திருக்காட்கரை  
மருவிய மாயன்தன் மாயம் நினைதொறே. (2)

urukumāl neñcam uyiriṉ paramaṉṟi  
perukumāl vēṭkaiyum eṉceykēṉ toṇṭaṉēṉ  
teruvuellām kāvikamaḻ tirukkāṭkarai  
maruviya māyaṉtaṉ māyam niṉaitoṟē. (2)

**English translation of verse 9.6.1:**

What can this doting vassal do, whose love knows no bounds  
Unto the mystic Lord, Who in Tirukkāṭkarai resides lovingly,  
Whose streets are perfumed with scarlet lily?  
As I do His wondrous traits contemplate, my heart thaws down

**Notes:**

The Āḻvār wants to know how to stem the on-rush of his Godlove and the resultant melting down of his heart, so as to remain steady and stable and enjoy the Lord at Tirukkāṭkarai. But this is next to impossible because he is overwhelmed by the Deity’s extra-ordinary love and condescension. The heart is the principal functionary for enjoyment and if it gives way, no enjoyment would be possible, like unto the predicament of a man, launched into a river in spate, whose rubber raft starts leaking, right at the commencement. How can the poor little thing, the Āḻvār’s soul, smaller than a spec, contain his God-love, full and flooding? The streets of the pilgrim centre are full of fragrance all over, without distinction of main roads and by-roads and lanes and if this is the case with the exterior, what to say of the interior, the Sanctum where the Deity, the very embodiment of fragrance, ‘Sarva gandaḥ’ as the scriptures put it, stays!
