**[Tamil](/definition/tamil#history "show Tamil definitions") text and transliteration:**

சார்வே தவநெறிக்குத் தாமோதரன் தாள்கள்  
கார்மேக வண்ணன் கமல நயனத்தன்  
நீர்வானம் மண்எரி கால்ஆய் நின்ற நேமியான்  
பேர் வானவர்கள் பிதற்றும் பெருமையனே. (2)

cārvē tavaneṟikkut tāmōtaraṉ tāḷkaḷ  
kārmēka vaṇṇaṉ [kamala](/definition/kamala#history "show kamala definitions") nayaṉattaṉ  
nīrvāṉam maṇeri kālāy niṉṟa nēmiyāṉ  
pēr vāṉavarkaḷ pitaṟṟum perumaiyaṉē. (2)

**English translation of verse 10.4.1:**

Unto those that tread the loving path of devotion,  
Facile indeed are the lovely feet of [cloud](/definition/cloud#history "show cloud definitions")-hued Tāmōtaraṉ  
Of red lotus eyes, who does as the five elements stand,  
Who sports the discus, whose glory grand,  
The pre-eminent ones in [Heaven](/definition/heaven#history "show Heaven definitions") for ever chant.

**Notes:**

The [Āḻvār](/definition/aḻvar#vaishnavism "show Āḻvār definitions") affirms that the lovely feet of Tāmōtaraṉ ([Dāmodara](/definition/damodara#history "show Dāmodara definitions"), that is, Lord [Kṛṣṇa](/definition/krishna#vaishnavism "show Kṛṣṇa definitions"), Who displays His simplicity galore, exhibiting, on His tummy, the scar caused by the [rope](/definition/rope#history "show rope definitions") tied round it by Mother Yaśodhā) render the pursuit of the path of loving surrender, quite facile—see also I-3-5, where the Āḻvār exhorted the worldlings to stick to the path of loving surrender, imbibing the quintessence of the Lord’s own [teachings](/definition/teaching#history "show teachings definitions"), in His “Song Celestial”, When we talk of the Lord having been tied by a rope round the tummy, during His [Avatāra](/definition/avatara#vaishnavism "show Avatāra definitions") as Kṛṣṇa, the cow-herd boy, our [bondage](/definition/bondage#history "show bondage definitions") of [Saṃsāra](/definition/samsara#history "show Saṃsāra definitions") goes off. There is a happy blending of supremacy and simplicity in the Lord and He is, therefore, easily worshippable. The Āḻvār sets out, in this song, the Lord’s great qualities of head and heart as well as His exquisite charm. The Lord pervades all things and beings and not merely the five elements of fire, air, water, space and earth, as such.
