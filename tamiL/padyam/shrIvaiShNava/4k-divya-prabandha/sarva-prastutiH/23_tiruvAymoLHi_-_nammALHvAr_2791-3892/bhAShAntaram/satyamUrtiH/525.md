**Tamil text and transliteration:**

போற்றி மற்று ஓர் தெய்வம் பேணப் புறத்திட்டு உம்மை இன்னே  
தேற்றி வைத்தது எல்லீரும் வீடு பெற்றால் உலகு இல்லை என்றே,  
சேற்றில் செந்நெல் கமலம் ஓங்கு திருக்குருகூர் அதனுள்,  
ஆற்ற வல்லவன் மாயம் கண்டீர் அது அறிந்து அறிந்து ஓடுமினே.

pōṟṟi maṟṟu ōr teyvam pēṇap puṟattiṭṭu ummai iṉṉē  
tēṟṟi vaittatu ellīrum vīṭu peṟṟāl ulaku illai eṉṟē,  
cēṟṟil cennel kamalam ōṅku tirukkurukūr ataṉuḷ,  
āṟṟa vallavaṉ māyam kaṇṭīr atu aṟintu aṟintu ōṭumiṉē.

**English translation of verse 4.10.6:**

Know, ye, men adoring the lesser deities,  
‘Tis your past *Karma* that has kept you in this state,  
Away from the goal of emancipation, under śāstraic restraint;  
Better realise you can this ocean of *māya* ford  
Only if you can get hold of the Almighty Lord  
Who resides in Tirukkurukūr with fields fertile and lotus ponds fine,  
And knowing this, do unto His feet hasten.

**Note**

To a question supposed to have been put to the Āḻvār by the votaries of minor deities, as to why Śrīman Nārāyaṇa, declared by him, in so many ways as the Supreme Lord, did not bend them towards Him, instead of allowing them to drift in the manner they were doing, adoring the lesser gods, this song provides the answer. It is because of the heavy sins committed by them in the past that they have been tied down to their present lot of worshipping lesser deities, with the result that their emancipation from the dreadful cycle of birth and death and attaining Heaven have also been put off. Their hopes of redemption, therefore lie only in taking refuge at the feet of the Supreme Lord in His worshippable Form in Kurukūr. c.f. the Lord’s statement in Bhagavad Gītā, (7-14) that only those who take refuge in Him, cross beyond this ‘māyā’, [?] which helps their liberation instead of hindering it by concealing His real nature, as it does, in the case of the non-seekers of His grace.
