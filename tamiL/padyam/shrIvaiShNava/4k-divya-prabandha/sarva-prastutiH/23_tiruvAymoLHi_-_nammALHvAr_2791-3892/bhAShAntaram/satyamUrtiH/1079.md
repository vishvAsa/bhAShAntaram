**Tamil text and transliteration:**

அறிந்தனவேத அரும்பொருள்நூல்கள்  
அறிந்தனகொள்க அரும்பொருள்ஆதல்  
அறிந்தனர்எல்லாம் அரியைவணங்கி  
அறிந்தனர் நோய்கள்அறுக்கும்மருந்தே.

aṟintaṉavēta arumporuḷnūlkaḷ  
aṟintaṉakoḷka arumporuḷātal  
aṟintaṉarellām ariyaivaṇaṅki  
aṟintaṉar nōykaḷaṟukkummaruntē.

**English translation of verse 9.3.3:**

The texts, that reveal the Vedic truths abstruse, apprehend,  
The Lord as no more than One difficult to comprehend;  
The learned ones who propitiate Him do no better fare,  
They look upon Him as no more than the certain cure  
For their ills and evils; (they perceive Him not  
As the fountain source of bliss supreme and on Him dote not.)

**Notes:**

The Vedas proclaimed, “Vedāha metaṃ Puruṣaṃ Mahāntaṃ....”, that is, the Supreme Lord has been comprehended by them. But what indeed did they know except that the Lord is not easy of comprehension? The ‘Itihāsas’ (Rāmāyaṇa and Mahā-Bhārata) and the ‘Purāṇas’, which serve as the key to the study of the Vedas, fare no better. And what about the great sages like Vyāsa, Parāśara and Vālmīki? They could see in the Lord, no more than the cure for all their ills and evils—“Haraṇā Deva dukkānāṃ [Haṛṛtyabhidīyate][?]”, It is a pity, they could not delve deeper than this and revel in His exquisite Form and nectarean sweetness, as the Āḻvār Saints did.
