அறிந்தனவேத அரும்பொருள்நூல்கள்  
அறிந்தனகொள்க அரும்பொருள்ஆதல்  
அறிந்தனர்எல்லாம் அரியைவணங்கி  
அறிந்தனர் நோய்கள்அறுக்கும்மருந்தே.

aṟintaṉavēta arumporuḷnūlkaḷ  
aṟintaṉakoḷka arumporuḷātal  
aṟintaṉarellām ariyaivaṇaṅki  
aṟintaṉar nōykaḷaṟukkummaruntē.

**English translation of verse 9.3.3:**

The texts, that reveal the [Vedic](/definition/veda#vaishnavism "show Vedic definitions") truths abstruse, apprehend,  
The Lord as no more than One difficult to comprehend;  
The learned ones who propitiate Him do no better fare,  
They look upon Him as no more than the certain cure  
For their ills and evils; (they perceive Him not  
As the fountain source of bliss supreme and on Him dote not.)

**Notes:**

The [Vedas](/definition/veda#vaishnavism "show Vedas definitions") proclaimed, “Vedāha metaṃ [Puruṣaṃ](/definition/purusha#vaishnavism "show Puruṣaṃ definitions") [Mahāntaṃ](/definition/mahanta#history "show Mahāntaṃ definitions")....”, that is, the Supreme Lord has been comprehended by them. But what indeed did they know except that the Lord is not easy of comprehension? The ‘[Itihāsas](/definition/itihasa#vaishnavism "show Itihāsas definitions")’ ([Rāmāyaṇa](/definition/ramayana#vaishnavism "show Rāmāyaṇa definitions") and [Mahā-Bhārata](/definition/mahabharata#vaishnavism "show Mahā-Bhārata definitions")) and the ‘[Purāṇas](/definition/purana#vaishnavism "show Purāṇas definitions")’, which serve as the key to the [study](/definition/study#history "show study definitions") of the Vedas, fare no better. And what about the great sages like [Vyāsa](/definition/vyasa#vaishnavism "show Vyāsa definitions"), [Parāśara](/definition/parashara#history "show Parāśara definitions") and [Vālmīki](/definition/valmiki#vaishnavism "show Vālmīki definitions")? They could see in the Lord, no more than the cure for all their ills and evils—“Haraṇā [Deva](/definition/deva#vaishnavism "show Deva definitions") dukkānāṃ [Haṛṛtyabhidīyate][?]”, It is a pity, they could not delve deeper than this and revel in His exquisite Form and nectarean sweetness, as the [Āḻvār](/definition/aḻvar#vaishnavism "show Āḻvār definitions") Saints did.
