**Tamil text and transliteration:**

மாய்ந்துஅறும் வினைகள்தாமே மாதவா என்ன நாளும்-  
ஏய்ந்தபொன் மதிள் அனந்தபுர நகர்எந்தைக்குஎன்று  
சாந்தொடு விளக்கம்தூபம் தாமரை மலர்கள்நல்ல  
ஆய்ந்துகொண்டு ஏத்தவல்லார் அந்தம்இல் புகழினாரே.

māyntuaṟum viṉaikaḷtāmē mātavā eṉṉa nāḷum-  
ēyntapoṉ matiḷ aṉantapura nakarentaikkueṉṟu  
cāntoṭu viḷakkamtūpam tāmarai malarkaḷnalla  
āyntukoṇṭu ēttavallār antamil pukaḻiṉārē.

**English translation of verse 10.2.10:**

All your sins will go off, on their own, when you utter  
The name ‘Mātavaṉ’; undying fame shall in them vest that offer  
With ardour great, fine sandal paste, lamp and incense and gather  
Lotus flowers nice, for the diurnal worship of the Lord  
At holy Aṉantapuram, the city bounded by walls of solid gold.

**Notes:**

\(i\) The name, ‘Mātavaṉ’, (Mādhava) denotes the Lord, in conjunction with Mahālakṣmī, the Divine Mother and it is but natural that all our miseries die off, when we ejaculate the Lord’s name, betokening this highly benevolent combination of our eternal Father and Mother.

\(ii\) Serving the Lord with due ceremonies and worshipping Him uninterruptedly, free from distractions, in the High Heavens, is by-no-means a matter of surprise, because that is the land of unalloyed bliss and beatitude, rid of all impediments to the continual meditation and worship of the Lord. Unlike the denizens of the High Heavens, who hold an unbroken rapport with the Lord, the inexhaustible fountain of bliss, here, in this land of darkness and nescience, with its numerous distractions, if there are at least some who procure, with great care and devotion, choice materials with which to worship the Lord in His worshippable Form, it is indeed a matter for great surprise; surely, these are men of undying fame, indeed.
