**Tamil text and transliteration:**

கடிவார் தீய வினைகள் நொடியாரும் அளவைக்கண்  
கொடியா அடு புள் உயர்த்த வடிவு ஆர் மாதவனாரே.

kaṭivār tīya viṉaikaḷ noṭiyārum aḷavaikkaṇ  
koṭiyā aṭu puḷ uyartta vaṭivu ār mātavaṉārē.

**English translation of verse 1.6.10:**

Mātavaṉ, of exquisite Form,  
On whose banner is Garuḍa the bird,  
Destroyer of enemies, will, in no time,  
Root out the fell sins (we dread).

**Note**

What is emphasised here is the utmost speed with which Mādhava, the Lord, in conjunction with the Divine Mother, roots out all the evils in us. And what more? The Lord extends to the Soul, reclaimed just then, the same affinity as He holds for the pre-eminent Garuḍa, the ‘Ever-free angel—Nitya Sūri’. The reclamation is put through in a trice through the instrumentality of Śrī Mahālakṣmī, who urges: “My Lord, here is the supplicant at your door-step, tossed between birth on one side, and death on the other, and smitten, in between, by maladies, both mental and physical; please bestow your grace and redeem him, turning a blind eye to all his sins; else, you may have to write off the entire ‘*Līlā Vibhūti*’ (Sportive universe)”,
