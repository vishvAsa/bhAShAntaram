**[Tamil](/definition/tamil#history "show Tamil definitions") text and transliteration:**

கடிவார் தீய வினைகள் நொடியாரும் அளவைக்கண்  
கொடியா அடு புள் உயர்த்த வடிவு ஆர் மாதவனாரே.

kaṭivār tīya viṉaikaḷ noṭiyārum aḷavaikkaṇ  
koṭiyā aṭu puḷ uyartta vaṭivu ār mātavaṉārē.

**English translation of verse 1.6.10:**

Mātavaṉ, of exquisite Form,  
On whose banner is [Garuḍa](/definition/garuda#vaishnavism "show Garuḍa definitions") the [bird](/definition/bird#history "show bird definitions"),  
Destroyer of enemies, will, in no time,  
Root out the fell sins (we dread).

**Note**

What is emphasised here is the utmost speed with which [Mādhava](/definition/madhava#vaishnavism "show Mādhava definitions"), the Lord, in conjunction with the Divine Mother, roots out all the evils in us. And what more? The Lord extends to the Soul, reclaimed just then, the same affinity as He holds for the pre-eminent Garuḍa, the ‘Ever-free angel—[Nitya](/definition/nitya#vaishnavism "show Nitya definitions") [Sūri](/definition/suri#history "show Sūri definitions")’. The reclamation is put through in a trice through the instrumentality of Śrī [Mahālakṣmī](/definition/mahalakshmi#vaishnavism "show Mahālakṣmī definitions"), who urges: “My Lord, here is the supplicant at your door-step, tossed between [birth](/definition/birth#history "show birth definitions") on one side, and [death](/definition/death#history "show death definitions") on the other, and smitten, in between, by maladies, both mental and physical; please bestow your grace and redeem him, turning a blind eye to all his sins; else, you may have to write off the entire ‘*[Līlā](/definition/lila#vaishnavism "show Līlā definitions") [Vibhūti](/definition/vibhuti#vaishnavism "show Vibhūti definitions")*’ (Sportive universe)”,
