**Tamil text and transliteration:**

ஊழி முதல்வன் ஒருவனேஎன்னும் ஒருவன் உலகுஎல்லாம்  
ஊழி தோறும் தன்னுள்ளே படைத்து காத்து கெடுத்துஉழலும்  
ஆழி வண்ணன் என்அம்மான் அம்தண் திருமாலிருஞ்சோலை  
வாழி மனமே! கைவிடேல் உடலும் உயிரும் மங்கஒட்டே.

ūḻi mutalvaṉ oruvaṉēeṉṉum oruvaṉ ulakuellām  
ūḻi tōṟum taṉṉuḷḷē paṭaittu kāttu keṭuttuuḻalum  
āḻi vaṇṇaṉ eṉammāṉ amtaṇ tirumāliruñcōlai  
vāḻi maṉamē! kaiviṭēl uṭalum uyirum maṅkaoṭṭē.

**English translation of verse 10.7.9:**

Lose not your hold, my mind, on Mount Tirumāliruñcōlai, Cool and lovely,  
The seat of my majestic Sire, the One and One only,  
Who did all things create, at the appropriate times,  
In sole exercise of His will, sustained and dissolved them,  
Persevering thus, may you, my mind, prosper;  
And may it please You, my Lord, to give up Your glamour  
For my body and life and see that quickly they do wither.

**Notes:**

In the seventh song of this decad, the Āḻvār adored Mount Māliruñcōlai itself, as the one from which all that bliss, currently experienced by him, flows. For that very reason, the Āḻvār now advises his mind not to relax its grip on this mascot of a mountain. On hearing the Āḻvār’s address to his mind, the Lord would appear to have addressed Himself not to give up the Āḻvār’s body, as it was in this body, out of the vast succession of bodies occupied by him, down the ages, He was able to get hold of the Āḻvār. This naturally frightens the Āḻvār who is terribly keen on the quick dissipation and disseverence of his material body. The Āḻvār, therefore, prays unto the Lord that He should no longer desire his foul body but despise it, so as to bring about the early extinction of his body and the current span of life over here. One thing is quite clear from this, namely, the Āḻvār’s prolonged existence in this abode is not due to his sins (Prārabda Karma) but due to the Lord’s overwhelming love for the Āḻvār’s physical frame, making the Āḻvār plead, as above.
