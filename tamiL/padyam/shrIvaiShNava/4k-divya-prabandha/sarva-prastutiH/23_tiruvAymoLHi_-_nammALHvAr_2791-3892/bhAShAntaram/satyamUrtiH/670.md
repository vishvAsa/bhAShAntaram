**Tamil text and transliteration:**

ஆலின் நீள் இலை ஏழ் உலகும் உண்டு அன்று நீ கிடந்தாய் உன் மாயங்கள்-  
மேலை வானவரும் அறியார் இனி எம் பரமே?  
வேலின் நேர் தடம் கண்ணினார் விளையாடு சூழலைச் சூழவே நின்று  
காலி மேய்க்க வல்லாய்! எம்மை நீ கழறேலே.

āliṉ nīḷ ilai ēḻ ulakum uṇṭu aṉṟu nī kiṭantāy uṉ māyaṅkaḷ-  
mēlai vāṉavarum aṟiyār iṉi em paramē?  
vēliṉ nēr taṭam kaṇṇiṉār viḷaiyāṭu cūḻalaic cūḻavē niṉṟu  
kāli mēykka vallāy! emmai nī kaḻaṟēlē.

**English translation of verse 6.2.4:**

Aren’t You the One who once reposed on a fig-leaf tender,  
Holding all the worlds in Your stomach? Your wondrous deeds.  
How can we know when even the Celestials can’t comprehend?  
Oh, Lord, tending cows near about damsels with eyes like [spear,][?]  
Don’t tantalise us with white lies any more.

#### Note

The Lord refuted the Nāyakī’s allegation of hollowness and insincerity and put it back on her and her mates, saying that He was absolutely forthright and straightforward and it was only they that were full of viles. The Nāyakī was, however, quick to point out the incompatibility of His reposing on a tender fig-leaf afloat, holding, as a tender babe, all the worlds inside His tummy and added that His mysterious deeds baffled even the exalted Celestials. The Lord then explained, rather apologetically, that He got detained by His Mother, who had asked Him to grace the cows, giving Him the stick and that the Nāyakī should not frown at Him to such an extent for this delay, beyond His control. The Nāyakī was, however, in no mood to swallow this fabrication and scorned that, in the name of grazing the cows, He would have been after girls of His special preference. The bubble having been pricked, the Lord kept on shilly-shallying. The Nāyakī cut Him short, saying that He need not tarry any longer and tantalise her with all lies and that He would rather ply His trade with those damsels with fine bamboolike shoulders, with whom all His pretensions might pass muster.
