**[Tamil](/definition/tamil#history "show Tamil definitions") text and transliteration:**

'இதுவோ பொருத்தம்? மின்ஆழிப் படையாய்! ஏறும் இரும்சிறைப்புள்  
அதுவே கொடியா உயர்த்தானே!' என்றுஎன்று ஏங்கி அழுதக்கால்  
எதுவேயாகக் கருதுங்கொல் இம்மாஞாலம் பொறைதீர்ப்பான்  
மதுவார் சோலை உத்தர மதுரைப் பிறந்த மாயனே?

'ituvō poruttam? miṉāḻip paṭaiyāy! ēṟum irumciṟaippuḷ  
atuvē koṭiyā uyarttāṉē!' eṉṟueṉṟu ēṅki aḻutakkāl  
etuvēyākak karutuṅkol immāñālam poṟaitīrppāṉ  
matuvār cōlai [uttara](/definition/uttara#vaishnavism "show uttara definitions") maturaip piṟanta māyaṉē?

**English translation of verse 8.5.9:**

Oh, wielder of the effulgent discus, that mighty [weapon](/definition/weapon#history "show weapon definitions")!  
On Your banner is that [bird](/definition/bird#history "show bird definitions"), Your carrier with large plumes.  
How indeed your callousness can unto Your fame conform,  
Often do 1 ask myself and keep sobbing; what is at all the intention,  
I can hardly guess, of the wondrous Lord, Who was born  
In Uttaramaturai ([Mathurā](/definition/mathura#vaishnavism "show Mathurā definitions")), abounding in orchards fine.

**Notes:**

The [Āḻvār](/definition/aḻvar#vaishnavism "show Āḻvār definitions") is now revolving within his mind, what the Lord of wondrous deeds and auspicious traits, who, during His incarnation as [Kṛṣṇa](/definition/krishna#vaishnavism "show Kṛṣṇa definitions"), took [birth](/definition/birth#history "show birth definitions") at Mathurā (in Uttara Pradesh) might be intending to do with him. Let alone what He did for the [Pāṇḍavas](/definition/pandava#vaishnavism "show Pāṇḍavas definitions"), as against the [Kauravas](/definition/kauravas#vaishnavism "show Kauravas definitions"), how indeed does He mingle with [Garuḍa](/definition/garuda#vaishnavism "show Garuḍa definitions"), who (as [Āḷavantār](/definition/alavantar#vaishnavism "show Āḷavantār definitions") puts it, in [Śloka](/definition/sloka#vaishnavism "show Śloka definitions") 41 of his Stotra [Ratna](/definition/ratna#history "show Ratna definitions")) is said to fulfil several rolas, as [servant](/definition/servant#history "show servant definitions"), friend, vehicle (carrier), [seat](/definition/seat#history "show seat definitions"), banner, [canopy](/definition/canopy#history "show canopy definitions") and fan! Does the Lord really take all this service from Garuḍa or does He keep him also at a distance, as is the case with the Āḻvār? If the Lord so wills, He could come down to the Āḻvār, mounted on Garuḍa. Perhaps, even Garuḍa is not pressed into service, by the Lord, these days! And then, the discus could have jolly well been commissioned by the Lord, to cut out all those impediments, which operate as a bar to the Āḻvār’s union with Him and yet, if He has not done so, that only means. His relationship with the discus is no better than that which subsists between Him and the Āḻvār.

The Āḻvār is now left a-guessing what precisely the Lord’s intentions might be, with regard to him.
