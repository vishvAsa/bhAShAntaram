**Tamil text and transliteration:**

சோலைத் திருக்கடித்தானத்து உறைதிரு  
மாலை மதிள்குருகூர்ச் சடகோபன் சொல்  
பாலோடு அமுதுஅன்ன ஆயிரத்து இப்பத்தும்  
மேலை வைகுந்தத்து இருத்தும் வியந்தே. (2)

cōlait tirukkaṭittāṉattu uṟaitiru  
mālai matiḷkurukūrc caṭakōpaṉ col  
pālōṭu amutuaṉṉa āyirattu ippattum  
mēlai vaikuntattu iruttum viyantē. (2)

**English translation of verse 8.6.11:**

These songs ten, out of the thousand delicious songs,  
Gracefully composed by Kurukūr Caṭakōpaṉ, adoring  
The Lord Who resides in Tirukkaṭittāṉam, abounding  
In orchards many, will the chanters thereof elevate  
Unto the exalted Heaven with delight great.

**Notes:**

\(i\) These ten songs will, by themselves, elevate their chanters to the high Heavens, on the ground that the Lord shall not brook separation from them even for a trice. This, of course, means that the Lord will be greatly delighted to hear these songs and, in the exuberance of His joy, instantly lift the chanters up to His heavenly abode.

\(ii\) The songs relate the glory of the great Lord and their author is no less than His most beloved Saint Nam-māḻvār. The text, in the original, says that these songs are delicious like the milk porridge (rice boiled in milk and neatly spiced); the Lord constitutes the milk and the Āḻvār’s songs, the other ingredients, put together—a delightful combination of diction and subject-matter and manner of expression.
