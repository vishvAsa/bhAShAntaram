**Tamil text and transliteration:**

தாள் பரப்பி மண் தாவிய ஈசனை,  
நீள் பொழில் குருகூர்ச் சடகோபன் சொல்,  
கேழ் இல் ஆயிரத்து இப் பத்தும் வல்லவர்  
வாழ்வர் வாழ்வு எய்தி ஞாலம் புகழவே. (2)

tāḷ parappi maṇ tāviya īcaṉai,  
nīḷ poḻil kurukūrc caṭakōpaṉ col,  
kēḻ il āyirattu ip pattum vallavar  
vāḻvar vāḻvu eyti ñālam pukaḻavē. (2)

**English translation of verse 3.3.11:**

Those that recite these songs ten of peerless excellence,  
Out of the thousand sung by Caṭakōpaṉ of lovely Kurukūr,  
Adoring Īcaṉ (Lord), who spanned the universe, shall acquire  
World-wide fame and (everlasting) opulence.

**Notes**

\(i\) This decad sings the glory of the Lord at Tiruvēṅkaṭam and yet, it has been made out, in this end-stanza, that the decad extols the greatness of the Lord, Who, in His incarnate form as Trivikrama, spanned the entire universe. Our great Ācāryas hold that there is perfect identity between these two forms of the Lord. The Lord keeps standing at Tiruvēṅkaṭam to secure all His subjects under His patronising feet and so did Trivikrama, setting His feet on all and sundry, without distinction of high and low, rich and poor, Saint and debauchee. The Lord at Tiruvēṅkaṭam is also quite at home with the hunters and monkeys.

\(ii\) *Everlasting opulence*: This denotes the eternal service in Heaven, both body and mind being lovingly attuned to it.
