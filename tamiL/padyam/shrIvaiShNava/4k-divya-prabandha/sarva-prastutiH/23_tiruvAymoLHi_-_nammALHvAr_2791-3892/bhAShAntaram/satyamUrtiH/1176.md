**Tamil text and transliteration:**

பாதம்நாளும் பணிய தணியும்பிணி  
ஏதம்சாரா எனக்கேல் இனிஎன்குறை?  
வேதநாவர் விரும்பும் திருக்கண்ணபுரத்து  
ஆதியானை அடைந்தார்க்கு அல்லல் இல்லையே.

pātamnāḷum paṇiya taṇiyumpiṇi  
ētamcārā eṉakkēl iṉieṉkuṟai?  
vētanāvar virumpum tirukkaṇṇapurattu  
ātiyāṉai aṭaintārkku allal illaiyē.

**English translation of verse 9.10.9:**

Sorrow there’s none unto those that adore  
The Primate, the Lord Supreme Who dwells  
At Tirukkaṇṇapuram, the Vedic Scholars’ favourite abode;  
My mind with love unto Him does always swell,  
Him that does His feet for ever truly worship,  
Ills and evils shall no longer clasp;  
Is there now indeed anything I lack?

**Notes:**

The Saint preaches unto the world, voicing forth his own experience which they can very well share, if only they would adore, likewise, the feet of the Supreme Lord. The age-long accumulation of sins has been wiped off, in full, and the dreadful contingency of sins accruing hereafter has also been ruled out. If this is the case with the Āḻvār, there’s no reason why others should not achieve what he did, if only they would likewise pin all their faith in the Supreme Lord, the first and foremost, and lovingly adore His feet. Is there indeed any care or anxiety for the young one that reposes on the complacent lap of the Mother?
