**Tamil text and transliteration:**

வட்குஇலள் இறையும் மணிவண்ணா! என்னும் வானமே நோக்கும் மையாக்கும்,  
உட்குஉடை அசுரர் உயிர்எல்லாம் உண்ட ஒருவனே! என்னும் உள்உருகும்,  
கட்கிலீ! உன்னைக் காணுமாறு அருளாய் காகுத்தா! கண்ணனே! என்னும்,  
திண்கொடி மதிள்சூழ் திருவரங்கத்தாய்! இவள்திறத்து என் செய்திட்டாயே?

vaṭkuilaḷ iṟaiyum maṇivaṇṇā! eṉṉum vāṉamē nōkkum maiyākkum,  
uṭkuuṭai acurar uyirellām uṇṭa oruvaṉē! eṉṉum uḷurukum,  
kaṭkilī! uṉṉaik kāṇumāṟu aruḷāy kākuttā! kaṇṇaṉē! eṉṉum,  
tiṇkoṭi matiḷcūḻ tiruvaraṅkattāy! ivaḷtiṟattu eṉ ceytiṭṭāyē?

**English translation of verse 7.2.3:**

Shaking off all reserve, this lady calls out, “Oh, Lord of sapphire hue,”  
And at the sky gazes, pining for Him unique, Who slew  
The Asuras formidable, thawing down, she prays, “Oh, Lord invisible,  
You did incarnate as Kākuttā (Rama) and Kaṇṇaṉ, make yourself visible  
Unto me now”; Oh, Lord, who in Tiruvaraṅkam does recline,  
The walled city strong, what’s it you have unto this girl done?

**Notes:**

\(i\) The mother is amazed at the complete lack of the innate modesty on the part of her love-intoxicated daughter, her calling out loudly the name of her spouse and that too, the one indicative of His bewitching Form which she ought to enjoy secretly at heart.

\(ii\) The Lord, who slew the Asuras and relieved the distress of the Devas, notoriously selfish, should certainly rush to the aid of the weaker sex, particularly those who cling to His feet under all circumstances.

\(iii\) The upaniṣads state that the Lord will exhibit His exquisite Form and splendour to the subjects of His choice. It is this that emboldens the Nāyakī to call upon Him to appear before her. The Incarnate Forms like Rāma and Kṛṣṇa could, of course, not be seen at all times, they having already gone back to the Celestium. So then, the Āḻvār wants the Lord at Tiruvaraṅkam to appear before him in His iconic Form. Actually, the tough walls of the holy place would seem to extend an invitataion to the devout to come and enjoy the Lord reclining there in His worshippable form all the time, unlike the Lord’s incarnations, the irretrievable past.

\(iv\) The mother wants to know what exactly the Lord had done to bring about this kind of infatuation in her daughter.
