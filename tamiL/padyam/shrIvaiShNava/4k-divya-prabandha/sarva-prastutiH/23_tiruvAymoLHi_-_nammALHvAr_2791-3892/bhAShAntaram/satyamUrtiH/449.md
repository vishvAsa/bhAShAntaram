திரு உடை மன்னரைக் காணில், திருமாலைக் கண்டேனே என்னும்,  
உரு உடை வண்ணங்கள் காணில் 'உலகு அளந்தான்' என்று துள்ளும்,  
கரு உடைத் தேவு இல்கள் எல்லாம் 'கடல்வண்ணன் கோயிலே' என்னும்  
வெருவிலும் வீழ்விலும் ஓவாள் கண்ணன் கழல்கள் விரும்புமே.

**English translation of verse 4.4.8:**

On seeing the wealthy [Kings](/definition/king#history "show Kings definitions") (of the Earth), says my daughter,  
She has seen ‘Tirumāl’; nice things with gay colours,  
She jumps at, seeing in them her Lord, who did measure  
The worlds; any [temple](/definition/temple#history "show temple definitions") she sees, with [idol](/definition/idol#history "show idol definitions") inside, she adores  
As the temple of her [cloud](/definition/cloud#history "show cloud definitions")-hued Lord; [pines](/definition/pine#history "show pines definitions") she for ever,  
Kaṇṇaṉ’s feet, be she amorous or in a state of [fear](/definition/fear#history "show fear definitions").

**Notes**

\(i\) Beholding the earthly kings, the Nāyakī says she has seen her Lord. As the [Śāstras](/definition/shastra#vaishnavism "show Śāstras definitions") put it down, none can become a [King](/definition/king#history "show King definitions") without the grace of Lord [Viṣṇu](/definition/vishnu#vaishnavism "show Viṣṇu definitions"). The king is, therefore, said to contain an element of Lord Viṣṇu.

\(ii\) The Nāyakī visualises Lord [Trivikrama](/definition/trivikrama#vaishnavism "show Trivikrama definitions") in all things gay and colourful, and any stone-image in any templelike structure, she looks upon as the Iconic Form of Lord Viṣṇu and His temple respectively. As a matter of fact, salutation made to minor deities also reaches Him, as the Internal Controller of one and all. Indeed, the divine consciousness in her has developed to such an extent that she perceives Divinity in all external objects.

It is said that Saint [Nāthamuni](/definition/nathamuni#vaishnavism "show Nāthamuni definitions") once saw a King mounting an [elephant](/definition/elephant#history "show elephant definitions"), by planting one foot on the head of a subordinate prince standing nearby, and exclaimed: “Well, this is how my universal Lord mounts His vehicle, [Garuḍa](/definition/garuda#vaishnavism "show Garuḍa definitions"), stepping on the heads of [Brahmā](/definition/brahma#vaishnavism "show Brahmā definitions"), the demi urge and others”.

During those periods when she is steeped in God-love, the Nāyakī is said to be in an amorous state while, at other times, she is seized with fright, at the sight of the earthly relations around.
