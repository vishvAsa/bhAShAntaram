**Tamil text and transliteration:**

திரு உடை மன்னரைக் காணில், திருமாலைக் கண்டேனே என்னும்,  
உரு உடை வண்ணங்கள் காணில் 'உலகு அளந்தான்' என்று துள்ளும்,  
கரு உடைத் தேவு இல்கள் எல்லாம் 'கடல்வண்ணன் கோயிலே' என்னும்  
வெருவிலும் வீழ்விலும் ஓவாள் கண்ணன் கழல்கள் விரும்புமே.

tiru uṭai maṉṉaraik kāṇil, tirumālaik kaṇṭēṉē eṉṉum,  
uru uṭai vaṇṇaṅkaḷ kāṇil 'ulaku aḷantāṉ' eṉṟu tuḷḷum,  
karu uṭait tēvu ilkaḷ ellām 'kaṭalvaṇṇaṉ kōyilē' eṉṉum  
veruvilum vīḻvilum ōvāḷ kaṇṇaṉ kaḻalkaḷ virumpumē.

**English translation of verse 4.4.8:**

On seeing the wealthy Kings (of the Earth), says my daughter,  
She has seen ‘Tirumāl’; nice things with gay colours,  
She jumps at, seeing in them her Lord, who did measure  
The worlds; any temple she sees, with idol inside, she adores  
As the temple of her cloud-hued Lord; pines she for ever,  
Kaṇṇaṉ’s feet, be she amorous or in a state of fear.

**Notes**

\(i\) Beholding the earthly kings, the Nāyakī says she has seen her Lord. As the Śāstras put it down, none can become a King without the grace of Lord Viṣṇu. The king is, therefore, said to contain an element of Lord Viṣṇu.

\(ii\) The Nāyakī visualises Lord Trivikrama in all things gay and colourful, and any stone-image in any templelike structure, she looks upon as the Iconic Form of Lord Viṣṇu and His temple respectively. As a matter of fact, salutation made to minor deities also reaches Him, as the Internal Controller of one and all. Indeed, the divine consciousness in her has developed to such an extent that she perceives Divinity in all external objects.

It is said that Saint Nāthamuni once saw a King mounting an elephant, by planting one foot on the head of a subordinate prince standing nearby, and exclaimed: “Well, this is how my universal Lord mounts His vehicle, Garuḍa, stepping on the heads of Brahmā, the demi urge and others”.

During those periods when she is steeped in God-love, the Nāyakī is said to be in an amorous state while, at other times, she is seized with fright, at the sight of the earthly relations around.
