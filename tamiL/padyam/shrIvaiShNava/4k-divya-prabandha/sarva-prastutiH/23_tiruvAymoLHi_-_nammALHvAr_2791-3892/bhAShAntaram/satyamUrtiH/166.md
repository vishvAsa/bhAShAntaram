**[Tamil](/definition/tamil#history "show Tamil definitions") text and transliteration:**

அறியாக் காலத்துள்ளே அடிமைக்கண் அன்பு செய்வித்து,  
அறியா மா மாயத்து அடியேனை வைத்தாயால்,  
அறியாமைக் குறள் ஆய் நிலம் மாவலி மூவடி என்று,  
அறியாமை வஞ்சித்தாய் எனது ஆவியுள் கலந்தே.

aṟiyāk kālattuḷḷē aṭimaikkaṇ aṉpu ceyvittu,  
aṟiyā mā māyattu aṭiyēṉai vaittāyāl,  
aṟiyāmaik kuṟaḷ āy [nilam](/definition/nilam#history "show nilam definitions") māvali mūvaṭi eṉṟu,  
aṟiyāmai vañcittāy eṉatu āviyuḷ kalantē.

**English translation of verse 2.3.3:**

Wonderful ‘tis, you got into my mind,  
And in me, in (the clutches of) this mystic land,  
Still immature, did instil the desire to serve you around,  
Even as you did on the sly, obtain the land  
Of three strides from Māvali (Mahābali), as Vāmaṉa, the little lad.

**Note**

The present versification conforms to the interpretation given by Śrī Rāmānuja, duly changing the prose order of the text, as in the original, quite in keeping with the current milieu. Śrī Rāmānuja was taught the meaning of this song by his spiritual Instructor (Tirumālai Āṇṭāṉ), as follows, without any change in the prose order of the [poem](/definition/poem#history "show poem definitions") (as in the original text).

> “You instilled in me the desire to serve you at a time when I was > hardly evolved and yet, you have kept me wallowing in worldly > [life](/definition/life#history "show life definitions"), the hot-bed > for ignorance, instead of promoting my God-love and providing the > necessary incentives therefor”.

Śrī Rāmānuja had, however, no hesitation in pointing out to the learned Instructor that, put that way, it would be a reproach against the Lord and would, therefore, be a misfit in this decad, where the [Āḻvār](/definition/aḻvar#vaishnavism "show Āḻvār definitions") gives vent to the joy of Union with the Lord and sings His glory.
