**Tamil text and transliteration:**

விதியினால் பெடை மணக்கும் மென்நடைய அன்னங்காள்!  
மதியினால் குறள் மாணாய் உலகு இரந்த கள்வர்க்கு  
மதியிலேன் வல் வினையே மாளாதோ? என்று ஒருத்தி  
மதி எல்லாம் உள் கலங்கி மயங்குமால் என்னீரே!

vitiyiṉāl peṭai maṇakkum meṉnaṭaiya aṉṉaṅkāḷ!  
matiyiṉāl kuṟaḷ māṇāy ulaku iranta kaḷvarkku  
matiyilēṉ val viṉaiyē māḷātō? eṉṟu orutti  
mati ellām uḷ kalaṅki mayaṅkumāl eṉṉīrē!

Although Śrī Rāma was bemoaning his separation from Sītā, he felt greatly relieved after he got Sugrīva restored to his wife and Kingdom. Even so, the Āḻvār deems himself lucky to see the swans in a happy state.

\(ii\) The swans are briefed by the Āḻvār to tell the Lord that the sins of the Āḻvār are inexhaustible and that His redemptive grace alone can deliver the goods, in case the Lord insisted that the Āḻvār should first liquidate his sins and then only join Him.

\(iii\) *Third line*: ‘*here lies one*’: It is hardly necessary to disclose the name of this one by way of identification for the Lord jolly well knew His victim as none other than poor Parāṅkuśa Nāyakī, reduced to this critical state by their erstwhile union—
