ஆம் முதல்வன் இவன் என்று தன் தேற்றி, என்  
நா முதல் வந்து புகுந்து நல் இன் கவி,  
தூ முதல் பத்தர்க்குத் தான் தன்னைச் சொன்ன, என்  
வாய் முதல் அப்பனை என்று மறப்பனோ?

**English translation of verse 7.9.3:**

Shall I ever forget my Lord Who desired, I would better  
Become Chief of Prapannas’ clan and on me clarity bestowed,  
Entered my tongue to sing songs delicious which unto the pious cater,  
The Benefactor great, Who unto me the gift of speech endowed?

**Notes:**

\(i\) The [Āḻvār](/definition/aḻvar#vaishnavism "show Āḻvār definitions") gratefully acknowledges the Lord’s assignment to him of the role of redeeming the worldlings, sunk in sorrow and despair, by instilling in him, as a preparatory measure, clarity of knowledge and understanding that He is the Supreme Lord of the Universe, the Sole Refuge of all His subjects. Bent upon redeeming the subjects in the ‘[Līlā](/definition/lila#vaishnavism "show Līlā definitions") [Vibhūti](/definition/vibhuti#vaishnavism "show Vibhūti definitions")’ (Sportive Universe) and bringing them on a par with the denizens of [Heaven](/definition/heaven#history "show Heaven definitions"), the Lord inspires His chosen few, His messengers. Tradition has it that, during his sojourn at Śrī [Kāñci](/definition/kanci#vaishnavism "show Kāñci definitions"), the great Āḷavandār (Saint [Yāmunācārya](/definition/yamunacarya#vaishnavism "show Yāmunācārya definitions")) spotted out, by mere insight, young Rāmānuja, seen in the [company](/definition/company#history "show company definitions") of Yādavaprakāśa, at the holy [shrine](/definition/shrine#history "show shrine definitions") of Lord [Varadarāja](/definition/varadaraja#history "show Varadarāja definitions"), as the great religious reformer, the Chief Personage, who would, in the coming days, spread the gospel of [Viśiṣṭādvaita](/definition/vishishta-advaita#vaishnavism "show Viśiṣṭādvaita definitions") actually known as ‘Emperumāṉār [Darśana](/definition/darshana#vaishnavism "show Darśana definitions")’. Āḷavandār had no acquaintance with Rāmānuja nor did the latter know the former.

\(ii\) In the very manner of its [birth](/definition/birth#history "show birth definitions"), this hymnal ([Tiruvāymoḻi](/definition/tiruvaymoli#vaishnavism "show Tiruvāymoḻi definitions")) scores over [Rāmāyaṇa](/definition/ramayana#vaishnavism "show Rāmāyaṇa definitions"). While the Lord stepped on to the Āḻvār’s tongue and straightaway produced this great hymnal, Rāmāyaṇa had to pass through a number of intermediaries in succession, namely, Lord to [Brahmā](/definition/brahma#vaishnavism "show Brahmā definitions") Brahmā to [Sarasvatī](/definition/sarasvati#history "show Sarasvatī definitions") and from her to [Vālmīki](/definition/valmiki#vaishnavism "show Vālmīki definitions"), in the sense that she entered Vālmīki’s tongue to enable the latter to sing the great epic.
