**Tamil text and transliteration:**

மற்றொன்றுஇல்லை சுருங்கச்சொன்னோம் மாநிலத்துஎவ்உயிர்க்கும்  
சிற்றவேண்டா சிந்திப்பேஅமையும் கண்டீர்கள்அந்தோ!  
குற்றம்அன்றுஎங்கள் பெற்றத்தாயன் வடமதுரைப்பிறந்தான்  
குற்றம்இல்சீர் கற்றுவைகல் வாழ்தல்கண்டீர்குணமே.

maṟṟoṉṟuillai curuṅkaccoṉṉōm mānilattuevuyirkkum  
ciṟṟavēṇṭā cintippēamaiyum kaṇṭīrkaḷantō!  
kuṟṟamaṉṟueṅkaḷ peṟṟattāyaṉ vaṭamaturaippiṟantāṉ  
kuṟṟamilcīr kaṟṟuvaikal vāḻtalkaṇṭīrkuṇamē.

**English translation of verse 9.1.7:**

Let me, in brief, tell ye, men of this sprawling world!  
There’s no means for your salvation except to learn and abide  
In contemplation of the flawless traits of Kṛṣṇa, our Lord,  
Who, in North Maturai, was born;’tis indeed meritorious  
And would suffice, no need there is for practices, tiresome and tedious.

**Notes:**

The Āḻvār now expounds the easy worshippabiḷity of the Lord and the sweetness that flows from worshipping Him. All those, in this abode of ours, surrounded by the oceanic waters, are eligible to partake of the Āḻvār’s advice and reap the rich reward. The importance of looking upon the Lord as the ‘Ready Means’ (siddhopāya), the Means and the End combined, is being emphasised here, when the Āḻvār asks the people to desist from any other path of discipline, entailing tedious ritualistic observances. As true knowledge of the inter-relation between Man and God will, by itself, lead to salvation (Jñānān Mokṣaḥ), mere mental awareness of the Lord’s role as our sole Benefactor, with an inherent obligation to protect His feeble subjects at this end, will suffice. But then, it might be asked whether it would be faulty, rather superfluous, to sing the Lord’s glory, as enjoined in this song. No, it is not at all faulty insofar as this laudation is an end in itself and not done as a means for attaining Him, in a spirit of bargaining.

The Saint exhorts the temporal beings to do nothing more than recite the Lord’s names, which calls for no special effort, entailing fatigue. It may be recalled, in this context, how that great God-lover, Prahlāda invited his school-mates to ejaculate God’s names effortlessly, as follows:

> “Oh, Lord Supreme,” by morn, “Oh, Kṛṣṇa,”, at noon and “Oh, Govindā,”, > in the evening.
