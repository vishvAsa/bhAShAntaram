மற்றொன்றுஇல்லை சுருங்கச்சொன்னோம் மாநிலத்துஎவ்உயிர்க்கும்  
சிற்றவேண்டா சிந்திப்பேஅமையும் கண்டீர்கள்அந்தோ!

குற்றம்இல்சீர் கற்றுவைகல் வாழ்தல்கண்டீர்குணமே.

**English translation of verse 9.1.7:**

Let me, in brief, tell ye, men of this sprawling world!  
There’s no means for your [salvation](/definition/salvation#history "show salvation definitions") except to learn and abide  
In contemplation of the flawless traits of [Kṛṣṇa](/definition/krishna#vaishnavism "show Kṛṣṇa definitions"), our Lord,  
Who, in North [Maturai](/definition/maturai#vaishnavism "show Maturai definitions"), was born;’tis indeed meritorious  
And would suffice, no need there is for practices, tiresome and tedious.

**Notes:**

The [Āḻvār](/definition/aḻvar#vaishnavism "show Āḻvār definitions") now expounds the easy worshippabiḷity of the Lord and the sweetness that flows from [worshipping](/definition/worshipping#history "show worshipping definitions") Him. All those, in this abode of ours, surrounded by the oceanic waters, are eligible to partake of the Āḻvār’s advice and reap the [rich](/definition/rich#history "show rich definitions") reward. The importance of looking upon the Lord as the ‘Ready Means’ (siddhopāya), the Means and the End combined, is being emphasised here, when the Āḻvār asks the people to desist from any other path of discipline, entailing tedious ritualistic observances. As true knowledge of the inter-relation between Man and God will, by itself, lead to salvation (Jñānān [Mokṣaḥ](/definition/moksha#vaishnavism "show Mokṣaḥ definitions")), mere mental awareness of the Lord’s role as our sole Benefactor, with an inherent obligation to protect His feeble subjects at this end, will suffice. But then, it might be asked whether it would be faulty, rather superfluous, to sing the Lord’s glory, as enjoined in this song. No, it is not at all faulty insofar as this laudation is an end in itself and not done as a means for attaining Him, in a spirit of bargaining.

The Saint exhorts the temporal beings to do nothing more than recite the Lord’s names, which calls for no special effort, entailing fatigue. It may be recalled, in this context, how that great God-[lover](/definition/lover#history "show lover definitions"), [Prahlāda](/definition/prahlada#vaishnavism "show Prahlāda definitions") invited his school-mates to ejaculate God’s names effortlessly, as follows:

> “Oh, Lord Supreme,” by morn, “Oh, Kṛṣṇa,”, at noon and “Oh, Govindā,”, > in the evening.
