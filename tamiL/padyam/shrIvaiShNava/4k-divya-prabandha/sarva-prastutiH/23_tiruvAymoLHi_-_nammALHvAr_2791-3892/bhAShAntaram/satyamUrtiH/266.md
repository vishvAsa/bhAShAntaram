**[Tamil](/definition/tamil#history "show Tamil definitions") text and transliteration:**

சூது என்று களவும் சூதும் செய்யாதே,  
வேதம் முன் விரித்தான் விரும்பிய கோயில்,  
மாது உறு மயில் சேர் மாலிருஞ்சோலைப்,  
போது அவிழ் மலையே புகுவது பொருளே.

cūtu eṉṟu kaḷavum cūtum ceyyātē,  
vētam muṉ virittāṉ virumpiya [kōyil](/definition/koyil#history "show kōyil definitions"),  
mātu uṟu mayil cēr māliruñcōlaip,  
pōtu aviḻ malaiyē pukuvatu poruḷē.

**English translation of verse 2.10.10:**

Giving up gambling and thieving as means of subsistence,  
Get into Mount [Māliruñcōlai](/definition/maliruncolai#vaishnavism "show Māliruñcōlai definitions"), your final goal  
Where flowers are in full bloom and lovely [peacocks](/definition/peacock#history "show peacocks definitions"), in pairs, revel  
And there is the [temple](/definition/temple#history "show temple definitions") where the Lord lovingly stays,  
Who did elaborate the contents of the Scriptures, long back.

**Notes**

\(i\) ‘Thieving’ refers to ‘*[Ātma](/definition/atman#vaishnavism "show Ātma definitions") apahāra*’, the [stealing](/definition/stealing#history "show stealing definitions") of the Soul, looking upon ourselves as our own Masters ignoring the fundamental fact that we belong to the Lord.

\(ii\) *Gambling*: indulging in quibblings to put people on the wrong track and dissuade them from believing in the existence of God, good and bad, and things of that sort.

\(iii\) Long, long ago, the Lord disseminated the [Vedas](/definition/veda#vaishnavism "show Vedas definitions"), unseen, and later on, as Lord [Kṛṣṇa](/definition/krishna#vaishnavism "show Kṛṣṇa definitions"), He expounded their inner meanings, right from the chariot on the [battlefield](/definition/battle-field#history "show battlefield definitions"); [Bhagavad Gītā](/definition/bhagavad-gita#vaishnavism "show Bhagavad Gītā definitions") is but a restatement of the central [teachings](/definition/teaching#history "show teachings definitions") of the [Upaniṣads](/definition/upanishad#vaishnavism "show Upaniṣads definitions").

\(iv\) The Lord loves to stay in this pilgrim centre, just to attract, by His exquisite charm, those not amenable to His advice (upadeśa).

\(v\) *Final Goal*: Going to Māliruñcōlai is an end in itself.
