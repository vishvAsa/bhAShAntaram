**Tamil text and transliteration:**

சூது என்று களவும் சூதும் செய்யாதே,  
வேதம் முன் விரித்தான் விரும்பிய கோயில்,  
மாது உறு மயில் சேர் மாலிருஞ்சோலைப்,  
போது அவிழ் மலையே புகுவது பொருளே.

cūtu eṉṟu kaḷavum cūtum ceyyātē,  
vētam muṉ virittāṉ virumpiya kōyil,  
mātu uṟu mayil cēr māliruñcōlaip,  
pōtu aviḻ malaiyē pukuvatu poruḷē.

**English translation of verse 2.10.10:**

Giving up gambling and thieving as means of subsistence,  
Get into Mount Māliruñcōlai, your final goal  
Where flowers are in full bloom and lovely peacocks, in pairs, revel  
And there is the temple where the Lord lovingly stays,  
Who did elaborate the contents of the Scriptures, long back.

**Notes**

\(i\) ‘Thieving’ refers to ‘*Ātma apahāra*’, the stealing of the Soul, looking upon ourselves as our own Masters ignoring the fundamental fact that we belong to the Lord.

\(ii\) *Gambling*: indulging in quibblings to put people on the wrong track and dissuade them from believing in the existence of God, good and bad, and things of that sort.

\(iii\) Long, long ago, the Lord disseminated the Vedas, unseen, and later on, as Lord Kṛṣṇa, He expounded their inner meanings, right from the chariot on the battlefield; Bhagavad Gītā is but a restatement of the central teachings of the Upaniṣads.

\(iv\) The Lord loves to stay in this pilgrim centre, just to attract, by His exquisite charm, those not amenable to His advice (upadeśa).

\(v\) *Final Goal*: Going to Māliruñcōlai is an end in itself.
