**[Tamil](/definition/tamil#history "show Tamil definitions") text and transliteration:**

உதவிக் கைம்மாறு என் உயிர் என்ன உற்று எண்ணில்,  
அதுவும் மற்று ஆங்கவன் தன்னது என்னால் தன்னைப்,  
பதவிய இன்கவி பாடிய அப்பனுக்கு,  
எதுவும் ஒன்றும் இல்லை செய்வது இங்கும் அங்கே.

utavik kaimmāṟu eṉ uyir eṉṉa uṟṟu eṇṇil,  
atuvum maṟṟu āṅkavaṉ taṉṉatu eṉṉāl taṉṉaip,  
pataviya iṉkavi pāṭiya appaṉukku,  
etuvum oṉṟum illai ceyvatu iṅkum aṅkē.

**English translation of verse 7.9.10:**

There’s nothing in all the worlds, here, there and everywhere  
With which to recompense the Lord Who made me hymn  
Songs sweet, this grand Hymnal adoring Him;  
Methought I could unto Him my soul offer  
But then even that is but His own.

**Notes:**

There’s no question of repaying the Lord’s extraordinary kindness; even otherwise, there is nothing the [Āḻvār](/definition/aḻvar#vaishnavism "show Āḻvār definitions") could call his own, which unto the Lord be could offer. Even the soul is not his but belongs to Him as His vassal from time immemorial. At least, in this land of dark nescience, people with their erronerous notions of ‘I’ and ‘Mine’ might commit the mistake of offering something to the Lord as their own and realise their mistake later on with the dawn of true knowledge regarding their essential [nature](/definition/nature#history "show nature definitions"). Surely, there is hardly any scope for the commission of a similar mistake in the yonder [heaven](/definition/heaven#history "show heaven definitions") populated by the ‘Nityās’ and ‘Muktās’, duly enlightened.
