**Tamil text and transliteration:**

அணியன்ஆகும் தனதாள் அடைந்தார்க்குஎல்லாம்  
பிணியும்சாரா பிறவிகெடுத்துஆளும்  
மணிபொன் ஏய்ந்தமதிள்சூழ் திருக்கண்ணரம்  
பணிமின் நாளும் பரமேட்டிதன் பாதமே

aṇiyaṉākum taṉatāḷ aṭaintārkkuellām  
piṇiyumcārā piṟavikeṭuttuāḷum  
maṇipoṉ ēyntamatiḷcūḻ tirukkaṇṇaram  
paṇimiṉ nāḷum paramēṭṭitaṉ pātamē

**English translation of verse 9.10.8:**

May You for ever adore the lovely feet of the Supreme Lord  
At holy Tirukkaṇṇapuram, enclosed by walls, with gold and ruby laid,  
Him that is near at hand to those that lovingly worship  
His pair of feet and thus the dreadful cycle of birth escape,  
Rid of all ills and evils that dare not clasp you any more.

**Notes:**

The loving worship, referred to here, is the disinterested love of God, with no personal ends in view, which culminates in the highest reward, namely, possession of God Himself. Unto such votaries, the Lord is ever close and easily accessible and the natural corollary to this state is the riddance of their ills and evils, one and all, including the dreadful cycle of birth and death. Tirukkaṇṇapuram, the holy centre on Earth, looms like a Heavenly spot, set with gold, gems and rubies, in the eyes of the Saint.
