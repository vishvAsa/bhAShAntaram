**Tamil text and transliteration:**

நலம் என நினைமின் நரகு அழுந்தாதே,  
நிலம் முனம் இடந்தான் நீடு உறை கோயில்,  
மலம் அறு மதி சேர் மாலிருஞ்சோலை,  
வலம் முறை எய்தி, மருவுதல் வலமே.

nalam eṉa niṉaimiṉ naraku aḻuntātē,  
nilam muṉam iṭantāṉ nīṭu uṟai kōyil,  
malam aṟu mati cēr māliruñcōlai,  
valam muṟai eyti, maruvutal valamē.

**English translation of verse 2.10.7:**

It would be best if you got yourself attached,  
With due reverence, to Māliruñ Cōlai where shines  
The Moon clear and dwells the Lord Who once  
Redeemed the Earth (as the Boar unique); better teach  
Your mind this advice good, let it not dredge in hell.

**Notes**

\(i\) Going to hell does not mean that those who somehow fail to visit this pilgrim centre will go to hell. To be in conjunction with the Lord, as Sītā put it to Śrī Rāma before setting out for exile, is Swarga while being away from Him is hell. The emphasis here is, therefore, on not getting parted from the Lord.

\(ii\) The Moon’s blemishes having been removed by his rubbing against the hill-top of this station, he is shining quite clear.

\(iii\) “*With due reverence*”: duly realising the inter-relationship between Man and God.
