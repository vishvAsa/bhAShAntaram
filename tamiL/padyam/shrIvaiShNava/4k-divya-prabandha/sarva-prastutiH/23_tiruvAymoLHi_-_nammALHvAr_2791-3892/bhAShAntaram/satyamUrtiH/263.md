**[Tamil](/definition/tamil#history "show Tamil definitions") text and transliteration:**

நலம் என நினைமின் நரகு அழுந்தாதே,  
நிலம் முனம் இடந்தான் நீடு உறை கோயில்,  
மலம் அறு மதி சேர் மாலிருஞ்சோலை,  
வலம் முறை எய்தி, மருவுதல் வலமே.

nalam eṉa niṉaimiṉ naraku aḻuntātē,  
[nilam](/definition/nilam#history "show nilam definitions") muṉam iṭantāṉ nīṭu uṟai [kōyil](/definition/koyil#history "show kōyil definitions"),  
malam aṟu mati cēr [māliruñcōlai](/definition/maliruncolai#vaishnavism "show māliruñcōlai definitions"),  
valam muṟai eyti, maruvutal valamē.

**English translation of verse 2.10.7:**

It would be best if you got yourself attached,  
With due reverence, to Māliruñ Cōlai where shines  
The Moon clear and dwells the Lord Who once  
Redeemed the Earth (as the [Boar](/definition/boar#history "show Boar definitions") unique); better teach  
Your mind this advice good, let it not dredge in [hell](/definition/hell#history "show hell definitions").

**Notes**

\(i\) Going to hell does not mean that those who somehow fail to [visit](/definition/visit#history "show visit definitions") this pilgrim centre will go to hell. To be in conjunction with the Lord, as [Sītā](/definition/sita#vaishnavism "show Sītā definitions") put it to [Śrī Rāma](/definition/shrirama#history "show Śrī Rāma definitions") before setting out for exile, is [Swarga](/definition/svarga#vaishnavism "show Swarga definitions") while being away from Him is hell. The emphasis here is, therefore, on not getting parted from the Lord.

\(ii\) The Moon’s blemishes having been removed by his rubbing against the hill-top of this station, he is shining quite clear.

\(iii\) “*With due reverence*”: duly [realising](/definition/realising#history "show realising definitions") the inter-relationship between Man and God.
