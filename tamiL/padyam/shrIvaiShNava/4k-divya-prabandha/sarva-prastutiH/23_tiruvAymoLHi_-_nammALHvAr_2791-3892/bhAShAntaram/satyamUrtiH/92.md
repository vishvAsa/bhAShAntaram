**Tamil text and transliteration:**

அமரர் முழுமுதல் ஆகிய ஆதியை,  
அமரர்க்கு அமுது ஈந்த ஆயர் கொழுந்தை,  
அமர அழும்பத் துழாவி என் ஆவி,  
அமரத் தழுவிற்று இனி அகலும்மோ.

amarar muḻumutal ākiya ātiyai,  
amararkku amutu īnta āyar koḻuntai,  
amara aḻumpat tuḻāvi eṉ āvi,  
amarat taḻuviṟṟu iṉi akalummō.

**English translation of verse 1.7.9:**

The Primate Who unto Celestials is the fountain source  
Of all felicities, Who unto *Amarar* (Devas) delivered ambrosia,  
The Chief of the cowherds got into my soul, in tight embrace,  
With pleasure immense; Could He from me be apart anymore?

**Note**

Unto the Devas, who wanted ‘Amṛt’ (ambrosia), the mere extract from the ocean and not the Lord Himself, He gave the Amṛt; He, however, gave Himself to the Cowherds in whose midst He was born, because they wanted Him, the real ‘Amṛt’ and not that artificial stuff. The Āḻvār’s soul got steeped in Him to such an extent and in such a manner that the one couldn’t be told from the other and hence there was no question of separation, as if they were two different entities,
