சுடர்ப்பாம்பணை நம்பரனை திருமாலை  
அடிச்சேர்வகை வண்குருகூர்ச் சடகோபன்  
முடிப்பான் சொன்னஆயிரத்து இப்பத்தும் சன்மம்  
விடத் தேய்ந்தற நோக்கும் தன்கண்கள் சிவந்தே (2)

cuṭarppāmpaṇai namparaṉai tirumālai  
aṭiccērvakai vaṇkurukūrc [caṭakōpaṉ](/definition/catakopan#vaishnavism "show caṭakōpaṉ definitions")  
muṭippāṉ coṉṉaāyirattu ippattum caṉmam  
viṭat tēyntaṟa nōkkum taṉkaṇkaḷ civantē (2)

**English translation of verse 8.7.11:**

These songs ten, out of the thousand of [Kurukur](/definition/kurukur#vaishnavism "show Kurukur definitions") Caṭakōpaṉ,  
Whose natural bent it is to adore, ever and anon,  
The feet of Tirumāl, Who does on the radiant [serpent](/definition/serpent#history "show serpent definitions") recline,  
Aimed at the complete severence of his moorings earthly,  
Will grind to a halt the chanṭers’cycle of [birth](/definition/birth#history "show birth definitions") and rebirth,  
Looking on it [as it were] with red eyes [spitting deadly poison].

**Notes**

\(i\) As stated in what is known as ‘Paryaṅka [Vidyā](/definition/vidya#vaishnavism "show Vidyā definitions")’, in the [Upaniṣad](/definition/upanishad#vaishnavism "show Upaniṣad definitions"), the Lord, [seated](/definition/seat#history "show seated definitions") on the serpent cushion, along with Mahāḻakṣmī in that glorious setting, grants audience to the ‘[Muktas](/definition/mukta#vaishnavism "show Muktas definitions")’ (Released Souls) on their reaching [Heaven](/definition/heaven#history "show Heaven definitions"). This very setting is alluded to in the opening [line](/definition/line#history "show line definitions") of this song as in the original, in keeping with the benefit accruing to the chanters of this decad as set out in this song, namely, release from the [bondage](/definition/bondage#history "show bondage definitions") of [Saṃsāra](/definition/samsara#history "show Saṃsāra definitions") and the terrific cycle of birth and rebirth. These ten songs, by themselves, deliver the goods, looking as it were, at the worldly ties of the chanters of these songs, with red eyes, spitting poison, so as to effectively destroy these ties and put the chanters in Heaven.

\(ii\) The [Āḻvār](/definition/aḻvar#vaishnavism "show Āḻvār definitions")’s ultimate goal is the Lord’s pair of feet where he longs to render incessant service, rather than the heavenly bliss, as such.
