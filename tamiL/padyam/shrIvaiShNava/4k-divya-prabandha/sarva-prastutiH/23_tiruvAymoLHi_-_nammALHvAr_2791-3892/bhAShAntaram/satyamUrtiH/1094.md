**Tamil text and transliteration:**

அரியாய அம்மானை அமரர் பிரானை  
பெரியானை பிரமனை முன்படைத்தானை  
வரிவாள் அரவின்அணைப் பள்ளிகொள்கின்ற  
கரியான்கழல் காணக் கருதும் கருத்தே.

ariyāya ammāṉai amarar pirāṉai  
periyāṉai piramaṉai muṉpaṭaittāṉai  
varivāḷ araviṉaṇaip paḷḷikoḷkiṉṟa  
kariyāṉkaḻal kāṇak karutum karuttē.

**English translation of verse 9.4.5:**

Long do I, in my thoughts, to behold the feet of the dark-hued Lord,  
Who does on the somnolent serpent-bed lovely repose, the benevolent Overlord  
Of the Celestials, the Lord Supreme, the Sire great,  
Who does His devotees’ opponents quell, Who did create  
Piramaṉ (Brahmā, the four-headed), first and foremost.

**Notes:**

That the Lord is most easily accessible to the devout and much beyond the reach of others has been highlighted by the Āḻvār himself, in I-3. This has now been pointed out to the Āḻvār by the Lord, who confesses to His easy-accessibility and enquires of the Āḻvār what precisely he wanted from Him. The Āḻvār wants nothing more than beholding the Lord’s lovely pair of feet, against the exquisite background of His serpent-bed and his enticing Form, like unto a dark emerald in sweet repose.
