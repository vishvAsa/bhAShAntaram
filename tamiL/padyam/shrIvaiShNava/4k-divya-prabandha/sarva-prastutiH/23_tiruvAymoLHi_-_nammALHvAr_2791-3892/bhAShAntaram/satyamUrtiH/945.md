சரணமாகிய நான்மறை நூல்களும் சாராதே  
மரணம் தோற்றம் வான்பிணி மூப்புஎன்றுஇவை மாய்த்தோம்  
கரணப்பல்படை பற்றறஓடும் கனல்ஆழி  
அரணத்திண் படைஏந்திய ஈசற்கு ஆளாயே.

caraṇamākiya nāṉmaṟai nūlkaḷum cārātē  
maraṇam tōṟṟam vāṉpiṇi mūppueṉṟuivai māyttōm  
karaṇappalpaṭai paṟṟaṟaōṭum kaṉalāḻi  
araṇattiṇ paṭaiēntiya īcaṟku āḷāyē.

**English translation of verse 8.3.2:**

Alas! even those, who abjure the path the [Vedas](/definition/veda#vaishnavism "show Vedas definitions") four prescribe  
For acquiring riches, have their final goal circumscribed  
By mere freedom from [birth](/definition/birth#history "show birth definitions") and [death](/definition/death#history "show death definitions"), pestilence and old age  
And do not get themselves in service engaged  
Of the Lord who the grand galaxy of protective [weapons](/definition/weapon#history "show weapons definitions") wields.

**Notes:**

In the preceding song, the Saint condemned those who hanker after the transient riches, instead of getting soley absorbed in God-love. And now, he speaks disparagingly of the ‘Kevalas’, those whose final goal is limited to mere emancipation from the terrific cycle of birth and death and remain-ling thereafter in disembodied state, lost for ever in that stupid self-enjoyment, thereby denying themselves the Supreme bliss of serving the Lord in [Heaven](/definition/heaven#history "show Heaven definitions") in that glorious setting. It is a great pity, these persons are not alive to their essential [nature](/definition/nature#history "show nature definitions") ([Svarūpa](/definition/svarupa#vaishnavism "show Svarūpa definitions")), as the exclusive vassals of the Lord, bound to serve Him exclusively. And so, the [Āḻvār](/definition/aḻvar#vaishnavism "show Āḻvār definitions") can hardly muster strength for the service of the Lord either from the ranks of the seekers of the so-called ‘riches’ or those of the ‘Kevalas’.
