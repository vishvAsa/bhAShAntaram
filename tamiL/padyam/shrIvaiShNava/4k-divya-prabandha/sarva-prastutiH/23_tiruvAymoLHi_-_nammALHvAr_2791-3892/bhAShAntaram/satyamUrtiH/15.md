பரந்த தண் பரவையுள் நீர்தொறும் பரந்துளன்  
பரந்த அண்டம் இது என: நிலம் விசும்பு ஒழிவு அறக்  
கரந்த சில் இடந்தொறும் இடம் திகழ் பொருள்தொறும்  
கரந்து எங்கும் பரந்துளன்: இவை உண்ட கரனே.

**English translation of verse 1.1.10:**

The Lord pervades every little bit of the oceanic waters, cool and sprawling (and yet does not feel cramped but, on the other hand), He feels as easy there as in the expansive world outside. Either on earth or the upper regions (in the whole universe) there is no place where He is not immanent, dwelling, as He does secretly, in the heart of all things and being however minute, and in all places (imperceptible to the things and beings pervaded by Him ever firm and eternal). He is the Lord, who contains them all within Himself, during the period of [deluge](/definition/deluge#history "show deluge definitions") (in the state of dissolution).

**Notes**

\(i\) The Individual Soul, of the size of a minute speck, pervades the body it gets into, only by dint of its attributive consciousness; in the very [nature](/definition/nature#history "show nature definitions") of things, it cannot be co-extensive and co-expansive with the body it occupies, like God, who is omnipresent, not being conditioned by any limiting adjuncts of the other two entities, namely, spirit ([Jiva](/definition/jiva#vaishnavism "show Jiva definitions")) and matter.

\(ii\) The [doubt](/definition/doubt#history "show doubt definitions") as to how the Lord can pervade the inside out of the Individual Soul, of the size of a mere speck (subatomic) gets automatically resolved, seeing that the Lord, in but a juvenile form, contains all the worlds during the period of deluge—if the [golden](/definition/gold#history "show golden definitions") stomach, which devoured all the butter stored up by the damsels in the pastoral [village](/definition/village#history "show village definitions") of Gokul, could contain within it all the worlds as well, why should one doubt the Lord’s power of pervasion of the minutest of things, both in and out?
