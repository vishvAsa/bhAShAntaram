**Tamil text and transliteration:**

நீராய் நிலனாய் தீயாய் காலாய் நெடுவானாய்,  
சீரார் சுடர்கள் இரண்டாய் சிவனாய் அயனானாய்,  
கூரார் ஆழி வெண்சங்கு ஏந்தி கொடியேன்பால்  
வாராய், ஒருநாள் மண்ணும் விண்ணும் மகிழவே.

nīrāy nilaṉāy tīyāy kālāy neṭuvāṉāy,  
cīrār cuṭarkaḷ iraṇṭāy civaṉāy ayaṉāṉāy,  
kūrār āḻi veṇcaṅku ēnti koṭiyēṉpāl  
vārāy, orunāḷ maṇṇum viṇṇum makiḻavē.

**English translation of verse 6.9.1:**

Oh, Lord, You pervade the elements, one and all,  
The Sun, the Moon, Civaṉ and Ayaṉ, as Internal Controller of them all;  
Please appear before this sinner, for a day at least, holding the discus sharp  
And the white conch so that Heaven and Earth do rejoice.

**Note**

The Āḻvār could certainly cognise the Universal Form of the Lord, in the created world of multifarious things and creatures, even as Prahlāda did. There was obviously no need, in that case, for him to send emissaries to the Lord, here and there, as he has been doing. And now, the Āḻvār clarifies his stand; he pines for the Lord’s extraordinary Form of exquisite charm, wielding the sharp discus and the white conch, the Lord’s ‘Divya maṅgala vigraha’, the Supernal Form. It is for beholding this enthralling Form of the Lord, even if it be but once, that the Āḻvār is pouring out his heart. Did not Arjuna insist, after beholding the Lord’s Viśvarūpa’ (the breath taking Cosmic Form of formidable dimensions) that He be seen as the lovely Kṛṣṇa, as before, with just four arms, as against the thousands shown to him?
