**Tamil text and transliteration:**

வீடுமின் முற்றவும் வீடு செய்து உம் உயிர்  
வீடு உடையானிடை வீடு செய்ம்மினே.

vīṭumiṉ muṟṟavum vīṭu ceytu um uyir  
vīṭu uṭaiyāṉiṭai vīṭu ceymmiṉē.

**English translation of verse 1.2.1:**

Give up, *in toto*, [all that militates against holding a rapport with God] and giving up thus, surrender yourself unto (Him) the Custodian [the great Ordainer and Granter] of Heaven.

**Notes**

\(i\) Śrīman Nārāyaṇa is the Granter of Heaven, and yet the Āḻvār has not straightaway revealed that Holy Name, just to set the mind (of the listener) on to enquire, that is, stimulate spiritual investigation. Actually, the revelation comes in the tenth stanza.

\(ii\) What is emphasised in this stanza is the sacrifice of the worldly appetites to the surpassing love and beauty of God, the supreme preference to God, as against the adulteration of the senses towards earthly disposition-

If giving up has been mentioned first and surrender to the Lord next, one has to appreciate this sequence in the context of a child holding by the hand a live snake, and the elders around crying out: “*Drop it* down, *drop it* down, it is a snake!” Another example would be a passer-by, seeing a house on fire, exhorts the inmates of the house, “*Come out, come out*, your house is on fire”. The emphasis thus rests on that which is to be eschewed, it being obnoxious, the very antithesis of the Lord to whom we owe undivided allegiance.
