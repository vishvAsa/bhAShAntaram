**Tamil text and transliteration:**

உகவையால் நெஞ்சம் உள் உருகி உன் தாமரைத் தடம் கண் விழிகளின்  
அக வலைப் படுப்பான் அழித்தாய் உன் திருவடியால்  
தகவு செய்திலை எங்கள் சிற்றிலும் யாம் அடு சிறு சோறும் கண்டு நின்-  
முக ஒளி திகழ முறுவல் செய்து நின்றிலையே.

ukavaiyāl neñcam uḷ uruki uṉ tāmarait taṭam kaṇ viḻikaḷiṉ  
aka valaip paṭuppāṉ aḻittāy uṉ tiruvaṭiyāl  
takavu ceytilai eṅkaḷ ciṟṟilum yām aṭu ciṟu cōṟum kaṇṭu niṉ-  
muka oḷi tikaḻa muṟuval ceytu niṉṟilaiyē.

**English translation of verse 6.2.9:**

Smile You could and watch with Your face bright,  
The castles we built in our play and the food we cooked.  
But You kicked them all, You have indeed no heart.  
Just to trap us into the sweet looks  
From Your large, lotus eyes, with our hearts melting down.

#### Note

In spite of His intercepting the Gopīs, they went their own way, playing games like building houses and cooking food. Śrī Kṛṣṇa, literally pining for their sweet glances, albeit by way of quarrelling with Him, kicked all those things out. Knowing His mind quite well, the Gopīs looked at Him squarely and addressed Him, as above. The inner (esoteric) meaning of this is:

Those engaged in God-love quite often undergo the pangs of separation, when He does not oblige them with His sweet presence and the communion gets snapped. To avoid this painful contingency, these very people switch on to worldly affairs. But the Lord would not give them up and His lovely feet drag them back into His fold, kicking out their erstwhile aberration, the tendency to drift away from Him.
