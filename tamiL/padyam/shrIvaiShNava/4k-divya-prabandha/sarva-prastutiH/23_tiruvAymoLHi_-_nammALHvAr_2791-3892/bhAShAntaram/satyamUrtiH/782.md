title = "782 Sixth Centum, in retrospect (Decad-wise Summary)"

+++
(6-1): *In the opening decad of this centum*, the Lord seeks out the Lord, in His worshippable Form at Tiruvaṇvaṇṭūr (in [Kerala](/definition/kerala#history "show Kerala definitions") State). Being too feeble to reach that place, the [Āḻvār](/definition/aḻvar#vaishnavism "show Āḻvār definitions"), once again transformed as the Nāyakī, in a forlorn state, sends some [birds](/definition/bird#history "show birds definitions") and bees to convey her message to the Lord, in His Incarnate Form (a gathered from the tenth song of this decad), invoking His pledge to extend protection to His devotees;

(This is the second of the four decads in the whole work, where the Āḻvār (*transformed as Nāyakī*) sends emissaries to the Lord at various destinations, to convey her message to Him; the earlier one is I-4 and the later ones are VI-8 and IX-7).

(6-2): In response to the message sent, as in the opening decad, the Lord eventually presents Himself before the Nāyakī who is, however, seen, *in the second decad*, resenting His delayed appearance. With the characteristic feminine jealousy and rancour, the Nāyakī arraigns the Lord for having apparently strayed elsewhere, making love to the damsels of His special preference, and asks Him to go back to them. This is virtually a re-enactment of [Kṛṣṇa](/definition/krishna#vaishnavism "show Kṛṣṇa definitions")-[Gopīs](/definition/gopi#vaishnavism "show Gopīs definitions") episode of [Śrīmad Bhāgavatam](/definition/shrimad-bhagavatam#vaishnavism "show Śrīmad Bhāgavatam definitions"); the rancour of the overzealous Gopīs would obviously not last long, being but an interim facet of connubial relationship, culminating in the reunion of the all-conquering [Lover](/definition/lover#history "show Lover definitions") and His beloveds;

(6-3): The Saint keeps musing over the superior might of the Lord, in having got him round, despite his stout resolve not to have anything to do with that malingering defaulter, any more. The Lord reveals to the Āḻvār His extraordinary capacity for achieving the impossible and reconciling the incompatibles besides the glorious Iconic Form in which He stays in Tiruviṇṇakar (in [Tamil Nadu](/definition/tamilnadu#history "show Tamil Nadu definitions"), near Tirukkuṭantai, already covered in V-8). The Āḻvār recounts his current experience, *in the third decad*;

(6-4): His erstwhile emotional break-down and exhaustion having yielded place to exhilaration, we see the Āḻvār recounting, *in the fourth decad*, the Lord’s glorious deeds and activities besides giving vent to his extraordinary joy, resulting from such recital *cum* contemplation. The Āḻvār concludes each song, in this decad, by showering on himself praises like “There is none equal to me in all the land”, “There is none above me” etc., expressions of an ecstatic mind, dissolved in God-love;

(6-5): *In the fifth decad*, the Nāyakī’s (Āḻvār’s) mates tell the elderly women around about the profusion of the Nāyakī’s love unto the Lord, enshrined in [Tolaivillimaṅkalam](/definition/tolaivillimankalam#vaishnavism "show Tolaivillimaṅkalam definitions") (deep south in [Tamil](/definition/tamil#history "show Tamil definitions") [Nadu](/definition/nadu#history "show Nadu definitions")). The mates keep guessing whether the Nāyakī could be but Nappiṇṇai (Lord Kṛṣṇa’s favourite Consort) reborn or an Incarnation of Mother Earth, full of grace or [Mahālakṣmī](/definition/mahalakshmi#vaishnavism "show Mahālakṣmī definitions") Herself;

(6-6): The gnostic mother speaks out, *in the sixth decad*, the desperate condition of her love-lorn daughter (Āḻvār); the manner in which the latter is dwindling down, losing, one by one, her feminine charms and embellishments. As the Nāyakī meditates on the wondrous deeds performed by the Lord in each of His various incarnations and the special traits, then exhibited by Him, she goes into raptures and her body thaws down and dwindles;

(6-7); The mother continues her narration—*in the seventh decad* also, voicing forth the Nāyakī’s extraordinary devotion to the Lord at Tirukkōḷūr (a pilgrim centre, also deep south, in Tamil Nadu), her inordinate longing for incessant communion with Him;

(6-8): The Nāyakī, who set out for the coveted Tirukkōḷūr, could not reach the place, bogged down, *en route*, due to her intense God-love; stranded half-way through, she sends messages through birds etc., *as in the eighth decad*, to the Lord in His ‘Para’ (transcendent) and ‘[Antaryāmi](/definition/antaryamin#vaishnavism "show Antaryāmi definitions")’ (hidden form as Internal Controller of all beings), invoking His trait of ‘aikarasya’ (feeling of oneness with His devotees);

(This is the third decad of this pattern, the earlier ones being I-4 and VI-1; one more, namely, IX-7 will follow).

(6-9): His errands, as in the eighth decad, not having evoked the desired response, the Āḻvār raises, *in the ninth decad*, his own clarion call of deep yearning, reaching the very [heaven](/definition/heaven#history "show heaven definitions"), with robust faith in the fruition of his full-throated call for deliverance;

(6-10): In the ninth decad, the Āḻvār voiced forth, in deep anguish, his inordinate longing for communion with the Lord, so as to be audible to Him, right in the high Heaven. And yet, there has been no response from the Lord, reducing the Āḻvār to a state of extreme mental distress and physical debility. Heis, however, quick to realise that the Lord stays, in His worshippable Form, in holy Tiruvēṅkaṭam ([Andhra](/definition/andhra#history "show Andhra definitions") Pradesh), the common [meeting](/definition/meeting#history "show meeting definitions") ground of ‘[Nitya](/definition/nitya#vaishnavism "show Nitya definitions") [Sūrīs](/definition/suri#history "show Sūrīs definitions")’ (ever-free angels in Heaven), the ‘Samsārīs’ (worldlings) on Earth, birds and [beasts](/definition/beast#history "show beasts definitions"). *In the first nine songs of the concluding centum of this decad*, the Āḻvār dwells upon the glory and grandeur of the Lord, the great Saviour and, *in the tenth*, he seeks refuge at the feet of the Lord, through the good offices of [Lakṣmī](/definition/lakshmi#vaishnavism "show Lakṣmī definitions"), the Divine Mother, inseparably poised on His winsome chest, voicing forth his sole dependence on Him.
