**Tamil text and transliteration:**

அல்லதோர் அரணும் அவனில் வேறுஇல்லை அது பொருள்ஆகிலும் அவனை  
அல்லது என்ஆவி அமர்ந்துஅணைகில்லாது ஆதலால் அவன் உறைகின்ற  
நல்ல நான்மறையோர் வேள்வியுள்மடுத்த நறும்புகை விசும்புஒளி மறைக்கும்  
நல்ல நீள்மாடத் திருச்செங்குன்றூரில் திருச்சிற்றாறு எனக்கு நல்அரணே.

allatōr araṇum avaṉil vēṟuillai atu poruḷākilum avaṉai  
allatu eṉāvi amarntuaṇaikillātu ātalāl avaṉ uṟaikiṉṟa  
nalla nāṉmaṟaiyōr vēḷviyuḷmaṭutta naṟumpukai vicumpuoḷi maṟaikkum  
nalla nīḷmāṭat tirucceṅkuṉṟūril tirucciṟṟāṟu eṉakku nalaraṇē.

**English translation of verse 8.4.5:**

True’tis, the Lord enshrined in temples elsewhere isn’t different  
From the One in Tirucceṅkuṉṟūr Tirucciṟṟāṟu enshrined and yet  
My mind abides not, in any other;’tis indeed my haven safe,  
Where there are castles, tall and elegant and the fumes fragrant  
Shoot from the ritual fire and darken the firmament.

**Notes:**

\(i\) While conceding the fact that the Lord, enshrined in Tirucciṟṟāṟu, also graces many other pilgrim centres, the Āḻvār says that his mind stands rivetted to this particular centre. This is like Hanumān having abjured even the Heaven and preferred to stay in this abode itself, saying, “Bhāvo nānyatra gacchati”.

\(ii\) The rituals performed by the Brahmins of this sacred place were not for securing any selfish ends and thus ‘niṣkāmya’ done, not with an eye on results, but as an end in itself. Even if there was a motive behind, it could be only by way of warding off the evil forces, the ungodly, so that no harm shall befall the Deity. This is, by-no-means, objectionable, as Nampiḷḷai would say. Even the great Rāmānuja had recourse to special rituals, using spells and incantations invoking Lord Veṅkaṭeśvara of Holy Tirupati, for cutting out the seemingly interminable life of that felon, the cruel Cola king, Kṛmikaṇṭha (worm-necked) whose religious persecution had forced that Saint to stay away from Sri-raṅgam for eleven long years. After a lapse of two or three days, a stinking smell, like that of singed hair, emanated from the sacrificial fire, whereupon Saint Rāmānuja stopped the ceremony, guessing that the heretical Cōḷa must be dead. The same day, a doorkeeper of Cōḷa poked the king in the neck with a staff, causing a loathsome stinking sore, full of vermin and the King gave up his ghost.
