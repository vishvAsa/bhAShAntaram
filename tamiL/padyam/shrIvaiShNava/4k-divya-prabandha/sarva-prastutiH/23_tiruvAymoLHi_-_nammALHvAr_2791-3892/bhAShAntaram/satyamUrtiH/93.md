**Tamil text and transliteration:**

அகலில் அகலும் அணுகில் அணுகும்,  
புகலும் அரியன் பொரு அல்லன் எம்மான்,  
நிகர் இல் அவன் புகழ் பாடி இளைப்பு இலம்,  
பகலும் இரவும் படிந்து குடைந்தே.

akalil akalum aṇukil aṇukum,  
pukalum ariyaṉ poru allaṉ emmāṉ,  
nikar il avaṉ pukaḻ pāṭi iḷaippu ilam,  
pakalum iravum paṭintu kuṭaintē.

**English translation of verse 1.7.10:**

Apart from them who from Him keep apart,  
Close to them who unto Him get close,  
Beyond approach (to the ungodly) but easy of access  
(To devotees); entranced do I sing His glory peerless,  
Day and night and never feel satiate.

**Note**

In the immense struggle between the Lord on the one side and the worldlings on the other, the latter, swayed by the stronger pull of earthly pleasures, stray away from Him. Indeed, the Lord grieves over this state of affairs. Unto those who seek Him exclusively, He responds so well that it is said, when man walks towards God, He runs towards him. When man ascends to the foot-stool of God, He enters the soul of man. Inexhaustible are His auspicious qualities and therefore it is that we can never reach the end and feel satiated in singing His praise.
