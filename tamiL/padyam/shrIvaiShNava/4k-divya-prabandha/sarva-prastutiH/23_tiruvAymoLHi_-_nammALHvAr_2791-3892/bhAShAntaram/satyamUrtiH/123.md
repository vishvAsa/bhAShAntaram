**Tamil text and transliteration:**

பொருமா நீள் படை ஆழி சங்கத்தொடு,  
திருமா நீள் கழல் ஏழ் உலகும் தொழ,  
ஒரு மாணிக் குறள் ஆகி, நிமிர்ந்த, அக்  
கரு மாணிக்கம் என் கண்ணுளது ஆகுமே.

porumā nīḷ paṭai āḻi caṅkattoṭu,  
tirumā nīḷ kaḻal ēḻ ulakum toḻa,  
oru māṇik kuṟaḷ āki, nimirnta, ak  
karu māṇikkam eṉ kaṇṇuḷatu ākumē.

**English translation of verse 1.10.1:**

The peerless Vamāna bearing the martial conch and discus,  
The majestic weapons, Whose feet, long and lovely,  
All the seven worlds worshipped, as He grew into space,  
That blue-gem of a Lord is unto me visible!

**Note**

Even in his dreams, Mahābali had not conjured up the vision of the charming Lord presenting Himself before him, in all His grandeur and asking for a gift. Likewise, the Āḻvār had not the remotest idea that the Lord would ever come to him and reveal His exquisite charm to his naked eyes. No wonder then, he goes into raptures over the Lord’s spontaneous grace. This is indeed the key stanza for this decad.
