**[Tamil](/definition/tamil#history "show Tamil definitions") text and transliteration:**

நுமரோடும் பிரியாதே நீரும் நும் சேவலுமாய்  
அமர்காதல் குருகுஇனங்காள்! அணி மூழிக்களத்து உறையும்  
எமராலும் பழிப்புண்டு இங்கு என்தம்மால் இழிப்புண்டு  
தமரோடுஅங்கு உறைவார்க்குத் தக்கிலமே! கேளீரே.

numarōṭum piriyātē nīrum num cēvalumāy  
amarkātal kurukuiṉaṅkāḷ! aṇi mūḻikkaḷattu uṟaiyum  
emarālum paḻippuṇṭu iṅku eṉtammāl iḻippuṇṭu  
tamarōṭuaṅku uṟaivārkkut takkilamē! kēḷīrē.

**English translation of verse 9.7.2:**

Ye, herds of herons, moving with your mates inseparable,  
Better go and enquire of the Lord who dwells  
In Tirumūḻikkajam, whether I, by Him despised,  
And for that reason, by my kith and kin accused,  
Won’t be good [company](/definition/company#history "show company definitions") for those that on Him attend;  
‘Tis no use prolonging my agony, let me my [life](/definition/life#history "show life definitions") end.

**Notes:**

\(i\) The Lord stays in Tirumūḻikkaḷam, attended upon by a large number of devotees and it is but natural that the Nāyakī also longs to be in such good company. Her emissaries, the [birds](/definition/bird#history "show birds definitions"), are also merry, [enjoying](/definition/enjoying#history "show enjoying definitions") connubial bliss, and moving about in their flocks and it is only appropriate that the Nāyakī invokes their aid to cure her of her solitude and restore her to the Lord’s company in that glorious setting. Indeed, it behoves the affluent, far above wants, to feed the hungry and lift them from the pangs of hunger!

\(ii\) The Nāyakī feels that she is in an unenviable predicament and it would indeed be just as well that she ceased to exist. The Lord and she had been locked up, in union, only to be deserted by Him. This gave her kith and kin the handle to give her up and so, she is neither here nor there. There is, of course, no reason why the Lord should give her up and she suspects that the Lord has just forgotten her, absorbed that He is in the sweet company of His devotees, gathered in that holy centre. The birds in question are now required to remind Him of the lonely existence of the Nāyakī, at this end and the imperative need for His admitting her also into His fold over there.
