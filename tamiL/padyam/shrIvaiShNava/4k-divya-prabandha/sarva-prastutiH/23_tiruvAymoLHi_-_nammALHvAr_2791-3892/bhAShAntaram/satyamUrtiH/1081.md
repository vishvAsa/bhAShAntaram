**Tamil text and transliteration:**

மனமே! உன்னை வல்வினையேன்இரந்து  
கனமேசொல்லினேன் இதுசோரேல்கண்டாய்  
புனம்மேவிய பூந்தண்துழாய் அலங்கல்  
இனம்ஏதும்இலானை அடைவதுமே.

maṉamē! uṉṉai valviṉaiyēṉirantu  
kaṉamēcolliṉēṉ itucōrēlkaṇṭāy  
puṉammēviya pūntaṇtuḻāy alaṅkal  
iṉamētumilāṉai aṭaivatumē.

**English translation of verse 9.3.5:**

You, my mind, this sinner dire does entreat  
And tell in accent firm that you shall be resolute  
And attain the Lord of peerless charm, Who sports  
The lovely garland of tuḷaci, cool and fine  
That thrives so well on His charming person.

**Notes:**

Apprehending that his mind might treat his advice lightly and even brush it aside, the Āḻvār stresses again, the imperative need of its sticking to the Supreme Lord of exquisite charm, bedecked with tuḷaci garland, cool and fragrant. This is like entreating a person to drink the delicious milk. In Vaiṣṇava symbology, the holy tuḷaci wreath (Vaijayanti) is Lord Viṣṇu’s sovereign insignium, proclaiming His Universal Lordship. The great Nañcīyar would go into raptures on beholding Namperumāḷ, the mobile Deity in Śrīraṅgam. decked with tuḻaci wreaths, during the ceremonial processions. He would then recite this song which sent him into transport of joy.
