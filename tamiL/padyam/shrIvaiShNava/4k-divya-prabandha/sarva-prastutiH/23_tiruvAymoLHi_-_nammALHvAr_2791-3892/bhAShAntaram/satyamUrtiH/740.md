**Tamil text and transliteration:**

காரியம் நல்லனகள் அவை காணில் என் கண்ணனுக்கு என்று,  
ஈரியாய் இருப்பாள் இது எல்லாம் கிடக்க இனிப் போய்,  
சேரி பல் பழி தூஉய் இரைப்ப திருக்கோளூர்க்கே,  
நேரிழை நடந்தாள் எம்மை ஒன்றும் நினைந்திலளே.

kāriyam nallaṉakaḷ avai kāṇil eṉ kaṇṇaṉukku eṉṟu,  
īriyāy iruppāḷ itu ellām kiṭakka iṉip pōy,  
cēri pal paḻi tūuy iraippa tirukkōḷūrkkē,  
nēriḻai naṭantāḷ emmai oṉṟum niṉaintilaḷē.

**English translation of verse 6.7.9:**

My bejewelled daughter with her love-laden heart  
Would all things good, unto her Kaṇṇaṉ set apart;  
Leaving all the wealth over here she has set out  
Towards Tirukkōḷūr; the folks here will come out  
With all sorts of scandals against her but she minds not  
All that and unto her we really matter not.

#### Note

Whereas the worldlings would want all good things for themselves and their sons and daughters, Parāṅkuśa Nāyakī would, in the exuberance of her love for Lord Kṛṣṇa, insist that all good things be earmarked for His use. With such great wealth of God-love in her, where was the need for her to go anywhere else? This is what agitates the mind of the mother; rather, she feels impoverished without the Nāyakī and pines for the latter’s attention. As a matter of fact, one’s own children become worthy of reverence and worship, when they become God’s own. Saint Tirumaṅkai Āḻvār said in Periya Tirumoḻi, VII-2-9, “How can I look upon the (Spiritual) son, who goes to worship the Lord at Tirukaṇṇapuram, as my (bodily) son?”. Indeed, worthiness makes no distinction between father and son, preceptor and disciple. It is said that one Ammuṇiyāḻvār used to prostrate unto his own disciple, being fully conscious of the latter’s spiritual greatness, demanding such reverence. One day, the great Nañcīyar led his disciple, Nampiḷḷai, to the holy assembly, where the former loudly acclaimed the greatness of the latter.
