**[Tamil](/definition/tamil#history "show Tamil definitions") text and transliteration:**

மறை ஆய நால் வேதத்துள் நின்ற மலர்ச் சுடரே,  
முறையால் இவ் உலகு எல்லாம் படைத்து இடந்து உண்டு உமிழ்ந்து அளந்தா,ய்  
பிறை ஏறு சடையானும் நான்முகனும் இந்திரனும்  
இறை ஆதல் அறிந்து ஏத்த வீற்றிருத்தல் இது வியப்பே?

maṟai āya nāl vētattuḷ niṉṟa malarc cuṭarē,  
muṟaiyāl iv ulaku ellām paṭaittu iṭantu uṇṭu umiḻntu aḷantā,y  
piṟai ēṟu caṭaiyāṉum nāṉmukaṉum intiraṉum

**English translation of verse 3.1.10:**

My lustrous Lord, enshrined you are in the [Vedas](/definition/veda#vaishnavism "show Vedas definitions") four  
Which (unto aliens and heretics) reveal you not,  
The worlds you did create, picked them out from deep waters,  
Ate them up (during the [deluge](/definition/deluge#history "show deluge definitions")) and then spat them out,  
You spanned them too; seen thus as the Supreme Master,  
\|If you are worshipped by [Śiva](/definition/shiva#vaishnavism "show Śiva definitions") who does sport  
The crescent Moon on matted locks, Nāṉmukaṉ ([Brahmā](/definition/brahma#vaishnavism "show Brahmā definitions"), the four-headed)  
And Intira, is it really any wonder indeed?

**Note**

Brahmā was created by the Lord and all the rest created by Brahmā. And then, it is the Lord who redeemed the worlds from underneath the Oceanic waters, sustained them inside His stomach during the period of deluge and put them back, in position, later on. He also spanned all the worlds in just three strides. It is, therefore, hardly any matter for wonder that His Supremacy is readily realised by those super-eminent personalities created by the Lord Himself, Brahmā, Śiva and Intira, and He is worshipped by them all. Nor can the Lord feel flattered by such worship by His own creatures, a mockery of worship, like unto a person setting his foot on the head of a doll of his, decorated by him and pompously declaring that the latter worshipped him.
