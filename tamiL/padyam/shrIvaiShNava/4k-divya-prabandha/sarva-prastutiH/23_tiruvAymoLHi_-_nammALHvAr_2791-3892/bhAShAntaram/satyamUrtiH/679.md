In VI-1, the Saint sent messages to Lord [Rāma](/definition/rama#vaishnavism "show Rāma definitions") at Tiruvaṇvaṇṭūr but He responded, rather late. This made the Nāyakī furious and she enacted, in the preceding decad, all that tussle, which ensued between Śrī [Kṛṣṇa](/definition/krishna#vaishnavism "show Kṛṣṇa definitions") and the [Gopīs](/definition/gopi#vaishnavism "show Gopīs definitions"). Ultimately, the Lord proved victorious, as seen in VI-2-10, and the reunion between Him and the Saint materialised. The Saint now keeps musing over the superior might of the Lord, in having weaned him round, despite his stout resolve not to have anything to do with that malingering defaulter any more. The Lord reveals to the [Āḻvār](/definition/aḻvar#vaishnavism "show Āḻvār definitions") His extraordinary capacity for achieving the impossible besides the glorious Iconic Form in which He stays in Tiruviṇṇakar (In [Tamil-nadu](/definition/tamilnadu#history "show Tamil-nadu definitions"), near Tirukkuṭantai, covered by V-8). The Āḻvār recounts this experience, in the current decad.
