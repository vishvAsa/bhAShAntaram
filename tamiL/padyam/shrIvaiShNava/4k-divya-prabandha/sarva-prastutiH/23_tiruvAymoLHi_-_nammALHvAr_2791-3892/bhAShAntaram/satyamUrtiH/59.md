**Tamil text and transliteration:**

நினைந்து நைந்து உள் கரைந்து உருகி இமையோர் பலரும் முனிவரும்  
புனைந்த கண்ணி நீர் சாந்தம் புகையோடு ஏந்தி வணங்கினால்  
நினைந்த எல்லாப் பொருள்கட்கும் வித்துஆய் முதலில் சிதையாமே  
மனம் செய் ஞானத்து உன் பெருமை மாசூணாதோ? மாயோனே!

niṉaintu naintu uḷ karaintu uruki imaiyōr palarum muṉivarum  
puṉainta kaṇṇi nīr cāntam pukaiyōṭu ēnti vaṇaṅkiṉāl  
niṉainta ellāp poruḷkaṭkum vittuāy mutalil citaiyāmē  
maṉam cey ñāṉattu uṉ perumai mācūṇātō? māyōṉē!

**English translation of verse 1.5.2:**

Oh, wonderful Lord, You are the supreme architect  
Of all things conceivable and yet immutable you are!  
Will it not from your glory great detract  
If (Brahmā and other) Devas, Sages and others  
(Your creatures all) meditate on you, thaw down and unto You offer  
Flowers, sandal paste, sacramental water and incense burn?

**Notes**

\(i\) In this stanza, the Āḻvār realises that he is unfit even to say that he has defiled the Lord, What is his title, cither way, to dabble in God-head? It is something like a person, who, by reason of his birth, is precluded from learning the Vedas, saying that he has not learnt the Vedas, as if he has failed to learn a thing he is entitled to learn. This feeling of the Āḻvār could be inferred from his present observation that even the worship offered through their triple faculties of word, deed and thought, by the exalted Devas, like Brahmā, and Sages of the eminence of Sanaka, pales into insignificance and would only detract from His great glory, as the Supreme Architect of all. It is little better than a team of ants worshipping the majestic lion.

\(ii\) Once the seed is sown, what comes up is the tree; cotton disappears, when turned into thread which again disappears, when turned into a fabric. But it redounds to the great glory of the Lord, one of His many marvels, that He remains unchanged despite His being the material cause of the entire universe. Well, What glory is there in His being worshipped by His own creatures? It would make sense only if the Lord is worshipped by persons of comparable stature but alas! there is none falling in this category.
