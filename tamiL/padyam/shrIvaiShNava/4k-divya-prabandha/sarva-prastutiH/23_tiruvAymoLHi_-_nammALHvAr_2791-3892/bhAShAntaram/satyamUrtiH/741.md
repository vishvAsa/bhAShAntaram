**Tamil text and transliteration:**

நினைக்கிலேன் தெய்வங்காள் நெடும் கண் இளமான் இனிப்போய்  
அனைத்து உலகும் உடைய அரவிந்தலோசனனைத்,  
தினைத்தனையும் விடாள் அவன் சேர் திருக்கோளூர்க்கே,  
மனைக்கு வான் பழியும் நினையாள் செல்ல வைத்தனளே.

niṉaikkilēṉ teyvaṅkāḷ neṭum kaṇ iḷamāṉ iṉippōy  
aṉaittu ulakum uṭaiya aravintalōcaṉaṉait,  
tiṉaittaṉaiyum viṭāḷ avaṉ cēr tirukkōḷūrkkē,  
maṉaikku vāṉ paḻiyum niṉaiyāḷ cella vaittaṉaḷē.

**English translation of verse 6.7.10:**

Oh, gods, my broad-eyed daughter, like the doe young, has gone  
To the lotus-eyed Lord Supreme, in Tirukkōḷūr, all of a sudden.  
With no thought of infamy on her family heaped and gazes  
At Him there, all the time, I am indeed in a maze.

#### Note

Unable to brook separation from her daughter, the mother feels that the Nāyakī has been away from her, for quite a long time. It was indeed high time, she had come back but then the mother visualises the possibility of the Nāyakī getting absorbed in the exquisite charm of the lotus-eyed Lord (Aravintalōcaṉa) standing in front of the Deity, all the time, with no intermission. In such a frame of mind, there was no question of her being worried about what others might say about her abnormal behaviour and how it would affect the reputation of the family, as a whole. The mother addressed the Celestials in the upper regions, as if to enlist their sympathy.
