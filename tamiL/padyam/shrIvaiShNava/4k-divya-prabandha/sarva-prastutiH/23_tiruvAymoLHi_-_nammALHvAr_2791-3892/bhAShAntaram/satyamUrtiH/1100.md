**Tamil text and transliteration:**

ஆறாமதயானை அடர்த்தவன்தன்னை  
சேறுஆர்வயல் தென்குருகூர்ச் சடகோபன்  
நூறேசொன்ன ஓர்ஆயிரத்துள் இப்பத்தும்  
ஏறேதரும் வானவர்தம் இன்உயிர்க்கே (2)

āṟāmatayāṉai aṭarttavaṉtaṉṉai  
cēṟuārvayal teṉkurukūrc caṭakōpaṉ  
nūṟēcoṉṉa ōrāyirattuḷ ippattum  
ēṟētarum vāṉavartam iṉuyirkkē (2)

**English translation of verse 9.4.11:**

These songs ten, out of the ten hundreds, sung by Caṭakōpaṉ,  
Of Kurukūr with fields fertile, adoring the great one,  
Who the elephant in perpetual must had slain,  
Will lead the chanters, on to the Lord Supreme,  
The chief of the Celestials, unto them very sweet.

**Notes:**

\(i\) This decad is said to have the power to put the chanters on to the Supreme Lord, the beloved Chief of the ‘Nityas’ (Eternal Heroes in Heaven).

\(ii\) Even as the Lord slew the elephant in interminable must, He will destroy our sins of appalling magnitude.

\(iii\) The fields of Kurukūr provide its inhabitants with copious food while the Āḻvār, the great ṛavant of the place, feeds sumptuously, the ‘Mumukṣus’, the seekers of salvation, all over.

\(iv\) Even as every decad brings into focus a central topic or theme, every Centum stresses a particular aspect of God-head. See aphorism 215 of ‘Ācārya Hṛdayam’.
