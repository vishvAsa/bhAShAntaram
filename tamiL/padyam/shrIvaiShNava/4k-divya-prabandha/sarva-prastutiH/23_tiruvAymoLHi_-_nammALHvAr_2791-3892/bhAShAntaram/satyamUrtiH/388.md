+++
The Lord is most eminently suited for laudation by virtue of His innumerable auspicious traits, wondrous deeds and vast possessions. And yet, the worldlings would not listen to the Āḻvār’s advice, as in the preceding decad, to praise Him exclusively and desist from praising others. The Āḻvār, however, felt happy that he could at least get back from them unscathed without following in their footsteps. That spirit of complacence tuns through this decad also with an extra gusto. The Āḻvār gives expression to the various benefits accrued to him through his total absorption in the Lord, namely, full and complete freedom from (1) want, (2) obstruction in the enjoyment of the Lord, (3) trouble, (4) sorrow, (5) affliction. (6) hindrance, (7) fatigue etc.
