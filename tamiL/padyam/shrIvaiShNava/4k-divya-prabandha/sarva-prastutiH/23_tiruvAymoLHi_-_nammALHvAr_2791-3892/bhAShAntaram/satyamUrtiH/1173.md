**Tamil text and transliteration:**

அன்பன்ஆகும் தனதாள் அடைந்தார்க்குஎல்லாம்  
செம்பொன்ஆகத்து அவுணன்உடல் கீண்டவன்,  
நன்பொன்ஏய்ந்த மதிள்சூழ் திருக்கண்ணபுரத்து  
அன்பன் நாளும் தன மெய்யர்க்கு மெய்யனே

aṉpaṉākum taṉatāḷ aṭaintārkkuellām  
cempoṉākattu avuṇaṉuṭal kīṇṭavaṉ,  
naṉpoṉēynta matiḷcūḻ tirukkaṇṇapurattu  
aṉpaṉ nāḷum taṉa meyyarkku meyyaṉē

**English translation of verse 9.10.6:**

Love He bears unto those that seek refuge at His feet,  
The body of Avuṇaṉ, of the hue of red gold, He split,  
Our Lord, Who loves to stay in Tirukkaṇṇapuram,  
Whose boundary walls, set with pure gold, do gleam,  
Truly loves those that bear true love unto Him.

**Notes:**

\(i\) Whosoever takes refuge at the Lord’s feet is tended by Him with the same loving care, without distinction of high and low.

\(ii\) It was young Prahlādā’s great devotion unto the Lord, that made Him shed His enormous grace on him, despite his belonging to the Rākṣasa clan, and slay his dastardly sire, Avuṇan (Hiraṇya). The Lord loves His devotees even more dearly than they love Him and He has lovingly chosen Tirukkaṇṇapuram, as His abode, wherein He exhibits this great trait. The Āḻvār, therefore, calls upon people to worship Him at this holy centre, with unflinching devotion, devoid of selfish ends.
