இலிங்கத்து இட்ட புராணத்தீரும் சமணரும் சாக்கியரும்  
வலிந்து வாது செய்வீர்களும் மற்றும் நும் தெய்வமும் ஆகிநின்றான்  
மலிந்து செந்நெல் கவரி வீசும் திருக்குருகூர் அதனுள்,  
பொலிந்து நின்ற பிரான் கண்டீர் ஒன்றும் பொய் இல்லை போற்றுமினே. (2)

iliṅkattu iṭṭa purāṇattīrum camaṇarum cākkiyarum  
valintu vātu ceyvīrkaḷum maṟṟum num teyvamum ākiniṉṟāṉ  
malintu cennel kavari vīcum tirukkurukūr ataṉuḷ,  
polintu niṉṟa pirāṉ kaṇṭīr oṉṟum poy illai pōṟṟumiṉē. (2)

**English translation of verse 4.10.5:**

Ye, hardened perverts, led away by stories about Iliṅkam,  
Jains, Buddhists, heretics, one and all! you see, the Lord Supreme,  
Internal Controller of you and your deities, Polintuniṉṟapirāṉ does gleam  
In Tirukkurukūr with [paddy](/definition/paddy#history "show paddy definitions") [fields](/definition/field#history "show fields definitions") [rich](/definition/rich#history "show rich definitions"), better worship Him,  
There isn’t any untruth whatever in what I proclaim.

**Notes**

\(i\) Addressing the aliens and heretics, the [Āḻvār](/definition/aḻvar#vaishnavism "show Āḻvār definitions") sums up beautifully the quintessence of the [vedic](/definition/veda#vaishnavism "show vedic definitions") texts and purāṇik [teachings](/definition/teaching#history "show teachings definitions"), other than those pertaining to the ‘Rājasik’ and ‘tāmasik’ varieties. He affirms that his addressees and the deities they revere ([Agni](/definition/agni#vaishnavism "show Agni definitions"), [Śiva](/definition/shiva#vaishnavism "show Śiva definitions"), [Brahmā](/definition/brahma#vaishnavism "show Brahmā definitions") etc), are all controlled by Lord [Viṣṇu](/definition/vishnu#vaishnavism "show Viṣṇu definitions"), as the Supreme Controller, [seated](/definition/seat#history "show seated definitions") inside one and all. Unlike ‘[Liṅga](/definition/linga#vaishnavism "show Liṅga definitions") [Purāṇa](/definition/purana#vaishnavism "show Purāṇa definitions")’ and other [Purāṇas](/definition/purana#vaishnavism "show Purāṇas definitions"), which treat of the origin and prowess of particular deities and are prone, in the particular context, to exaggerate the importance of those demi-gods, Śri Viṣṇu Purāṇa says, in reply to a general question as to who is the Supreme God who brings into being all things and lives and finally dissolves them, that Viṣṇu controls all the three functions of creation, sustentation and dissolution. And this Supreme Lord, the Āḻvār now points out, is right here in [Kurukūr](/definition/kurukur#vaishnavism "show Kurukūr definitions"), in His Area (iconic) manifestation, wherein all His superlative excellences converge in a perfect measure as His name, ‘Polintu niṉṟa pirāṉ’ connotes. This being the dark land of nescience, His great qualities shine here far better than in [Heaven](/definition/heaven#history "show Heaven definitions"), where it is all day and no night, that is, all light and no darkness.

The Āḻvār avers that what he says is perfectly true, as there is no need for him to import greatness to the Lord Who is greatness itself unlike the demi-gods who need special boosting to prop them up.
