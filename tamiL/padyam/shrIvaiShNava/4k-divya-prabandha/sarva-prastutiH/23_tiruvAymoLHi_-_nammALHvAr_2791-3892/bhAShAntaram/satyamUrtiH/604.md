**Tamil text and transliteration:**

எய்தக் கூவுதல் ஆவதே எனக்கு? எவ்வ தெவ்வத்துள் ஆயுமாய் நின்று  
கைதவங்கள் செய்யும் கரு மேனி அம்மானே  
செய்த வேள்வியர் வையத்தேவர் அறாச் சிரீவரமங்கலநகர்  
கைதொழ இருந்தாய் அது நானும் கண்டேனே.

eytak kūvutal āvatē eṉakku? evva tevvattuḷ āyumāy niṉṟu  
kaitavaṅkaḷ ceyyum karu mēṉi ammāṉē  
ceyta vēḷviyar vaiyattēvar aṟāc cirīvaramaṅkalanakar  
kaitoḻa iruntāy atu nāṉum kaṇṭēṉē.

**English translation of verse 5.7.5:**

Oh, dark-hued Lord, it isn’t proper that I make any effort  
To attain you; you would with the ungodly mingle and pervert  
Their minds and get their brute strength cut out;  
Adored by Brahmins who the vedic rituals have put thro,  
Reside you do in Cirīvaramaṅkalam, well, I have seen it too.

#### Notes

\(i\) *The Lord to the Āḻvār*: “You cry out as if You haven’t received any benefit from me; haven’t You been shown my Iconic Form in Cirīvaramaṅkai?”

*Āḻvār to the Lord*: “Sire, I don’t deny that, but that is hardly enough for me. I do long for perennial service at Your lotus feet”.

Īśvara (God) is the ‘Svāmi’ (Master) while the Cetana (Jīva, the individual Soul) is the ‘Svuṃ’ (Property). It is this fundamental relationship that gives rise to the inescapable obligation of the Master in regard to His property, a matter of personal gain for Him indeed. It is against this back-ground that the Āḻvār points out, in this song, the impropriety of the property trying to get at the Master; it should actually be the other way round.

\(ii\) By sheer eloquence and fallacious arguments, the Lord did, as Buddha, pervert the minds of the ungodly Asuras, bent upon torturing and tormenting others, and beat them back. If these methods did not succeed, He would, in the last resort, mystify them and render them defunct by exhibiting His exquisite charm, vide detailed notes under V-10-4
