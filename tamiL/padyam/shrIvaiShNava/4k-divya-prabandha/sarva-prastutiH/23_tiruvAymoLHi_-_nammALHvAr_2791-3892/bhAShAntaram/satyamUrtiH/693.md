குரவை ஆய்ச்சியரோடு கோத்ததும் குன்றம் ஒன்று ஏந்தியதும்

**English translation of verse 6.4.1:**

Could there be any want for us, who dote, night and day,  
On the many exploits, mighty and marvellous, of the great Benefactor,  
Our Lord, resting on [serpent](/definition/serpent#history "show serpent definitions")-bed. His [dancing](/definition/dancing#history "show dancing definitions") with [Gopīs](/definition/gopi#vaishnavism "show Gopīs definitions"), going gay,  
Lifting up Mount [Govardhana](/definition/govardhana#vaishnavism "show Govardhana definitions") and trouncing the serpent in deep waters?

#### Note

The Lord, who was reposing on His serpent-bed in the Milky-ocean, gave up His bed and came down to [Mathurā](/definition/mathura#vaishnavism "show Mathurā definitions") (Uttar Pradesh). Recounting the many deeds of Lord [Kṛṣṇa](/definition/krishna#vaishnavism "show Kṛṣṇa definitions"), Who thus came down from the Milk-ocean to Mathurā, the [Āḻvār](/definition/aḻvar#vaishnavism "show Āḻvār definitions") begins with the famous ‘[Rāsa Krīḍā](/definition/rasakrida#history "show Rāsa Krīḍā definitions")’ where Kṛṣṇa assumes many forms and holds the hand of each of the half a million Gopīs, moving in a circle. It is but appropriate that the Āḻvār begins with this event, as he feels that his reunion with the Lord, after all that squabble in VI-2, is like the ‘[Rāsa](/definition/rasa#vaishnavism "show Rāsa definitions") Krīḍā’. On His part, the Lord, feels that His union with the Āḻvār gives Him the same amount of pleasure as He had, when in the [company](/definition/company#history "show company definitions") of that vast multitude of Gopīs during that classic [dance](/definition/dance#history "show dance definitions"). And then, the said dance revealed the amazing simplicity of the Lord. Such simplicity can, however, be appreciated in its true light only when it emanates from one who enjoys paramountcy (paratva) as well. Therefore it is, that the Āḻvār recounts the lifting of Mount Govardhana, betokening Śrī Kṛṣṇa’s supremacy, immediately after ‘Rāsa Krīḍā’.
