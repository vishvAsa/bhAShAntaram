**Tamil text and transliteration:**

குரவை ஆய்ச்சியரோடு கோத்ததும் குன்றம் ஒன்று ஏந்தியதும்  
உரவு நீர்ப் பொய்கை நாகம் காய்ந்ததும் உட்பட மற்றும் பல  
அரவில் பள்ளிப் பிரான்தன் மாய வினைகளையே அலற்றி,  
இரவும் நன் பகலும் தவிர்கிலன் என்ன குறை எனக்கே?

kuravai āycciyarōṭu kōttatum kuṉṟam oṉṟu ēntiyatum  
uravu nīrp poykai nākam kāyntatum uṭpaṭa maṟṟum pala  
aravil paḷḷip pirāṉtaṉ māya viṉaikaḷaiyē alaṟṟi,  
iravum naṉ pakalum tavirkilaṉ eṉṉa kuṟai eṉakkē?

**English translation of verse 6.4.1:**

Could there be any want for us, who dote, night and day,  
On the many exploits, mighty and marvellous, of the great Benefactor,  
Our Lord, resting on serpent-bed. His dancing with Gopīs, going gay,  
Lifting up Mount Govardhana and trouncing the serpent in deep waters?

#### Note

The Lord, who was reposing on His serpent-bed in the Milky-ocean, gave up His bed and came down to Mathurā (Uttar Pradesh). Recounting the many deeds of Lord Kṛṣṇa, Who thus came down from the Milk-ocean to Mathurā, the Āḻvār begins with the famous ‘Rāsa Krīḍā’ where Kṛṣṇa assumes many forms and holds the hand of each of the half a million Gopīs, moving in a circle. It is but appropriate that the Āḻvār begins with this event, as he feels that his reunion with the Lord, after all that squabble in VI-2, is like the ‘Rāsa Krīḍā’. On His part, the Lord, feels that His union with the Āḻvār gives Him the same amount of pleasure as He had, when in the company of that vast multitude of Gopīs during that classic dance. And then, the said dance revealed the amazing simplicity of the Lord. Such simplicity can, however, be appreciated in its true light only when it emanates from one who enjoys paramountcy (paratva) as well. Therefore it is, that the Āḻvār recounts the lifting of Mount Govardhana, betokening Śrī Kṛṣṇa’s supremacy, immediately after ‘Rāsa Krīḍā’.
