**Tamil text and transliteration:**

உயிர்கள் எல்லா உலகமும் உடையவனைக்,  
குயில் கொள் சோலைத் தென் குருகூர்ச் சடகோபன்,  
செயிர் இல் சொல் இசை மாலை ஆயிரத்துள் இப் பத்தும்,  
உயிரின்மேல் ஆக்கை ஊனிடை ஒழிவிக்குமே. (2)

uyirkaḷ ellā ulakamum uṭaiyavaṉaik,  
kuyil koḷ cōlait teṉ kurukūrc caṭakōpaṉ,  
ceyir il col icai mālai āyirattuḷ ip pattum,  
uyiriṉmēl ākkai ūṉiṭai oḻivikkumē. (2)

**English translation of verse 3.2.11:**

These songs ten, in the hymnal garland of thousand, Chaste and sweet,  
Knit by Caṭakōpaṉ of Kurukūr in whose orchards Koels go gay,  
In adoration of the Sovereign Master of all the worlds and their beings,  
Will rid (the chanters) of their fleshy shackles.

**Notes**

\(i\) The Āḻvār invests the Lord and the surroundings with his own feelings. Now that he has been put back on his feet, he sees in the Lord a special aura, and His ownership of all things and souls now becomes more pronounced, with the resuscitation of the Āḻvār himself.

\(ii\) Kurukūr is described, in this song, as a lovely place abounding in orchards, where koels sing merrily. When the Āḻvār was sunk in dejection due to separation from the Lord, the Koels had also lapsed into silence. Now that the Āḻvār is happy, these birds also sing sweet strains, as before.
