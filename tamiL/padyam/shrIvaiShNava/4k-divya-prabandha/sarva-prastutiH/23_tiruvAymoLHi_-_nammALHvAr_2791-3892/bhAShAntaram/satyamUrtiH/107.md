**Tamil text and transliteration:**

நீர்புரைவண்ணன், சீர்சடகோபன்,  
நேர்தல் ஆயிரத்து, ஓர்தல்இவையே.

nīrpuraivaṇṇaṉ, cīrcaṭakōpaṉ,  
nērtal āyirattu, ōrtalivaiyē.

**English translation of verse 1.8.11:**

These songs ten, out of the thousand  
Sung by Caṭakōpaṉ reveal his view profound  
That the Lord of water—tint  
Is like water, pliable and transparent.

**Note**

The terminal stanza in each of the preceding decads set forth the good results flowing from the study or recital of the stanzas in that decad. This end-song is, however, silent in this regard; instead, it says that, in this decad, the Āḻvār has expressed his considered view, the one that is crystal-clear to him from the entire hymnal, namely, the Lord is transparent, progressive and pliable like water whose complexion He bears.
