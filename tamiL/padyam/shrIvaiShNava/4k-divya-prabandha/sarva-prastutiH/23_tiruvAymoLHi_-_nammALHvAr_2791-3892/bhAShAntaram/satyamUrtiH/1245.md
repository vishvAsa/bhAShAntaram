**Tamil text and transliteration:**

நெடியான் அருள் சூடும் படியான் சடகோபன்  
நொடி ஆயிரத்துஇப்பத்து அடியார்க்கு அருள்பேறே (2)

neṭiyāṉ aruḷ cūṭum paṭiyāṉ caṭakōpaṉ  
noṭi āyirattuippattu aṭiyārkku aruḷpēṟē (2)

**English translation of verse 10.5.11:**

These songs ten, out of the thousand of Caṭakōpaṉ,  
Who basks in the grand sun-shine  
Of the grace galore of the Lord Supreme,  
Will put the chanters on a par with him.

**Notes:**

\(i\) The Āḻvār ends up this decad by stating that the chanters of these ten songs will be blest, like him, with the Lord’s spontaneous grace, in super-abundance.

\(ii\) Rāmāyaṇa, the great Ithihāsa, took birth in the grace of the four-headed Brahmā who is anything but steady, while ‘Viṣṇu Purāṇa’, the ‘Purāṇa-Rātna is the outcome of the benedictive grace of ‘Puḷasthya  one of the four disciples of Śiva of tāmasik temperament and habits. On the other hand, Tiruvāymoḻi flowed from the loving grace of Lord Mahā Viṣṇu, the Puruṣottama of unalloyed purity. Herein lies the overwhelming superiority of Tiruvāymoḻi over Rāmāyaṇa, the epic of top-ranking excellence and Viṣṇupurāṇa which occupies the pride of place among the Purāṇas.

\(iii\) The Āḻvār could himself declare that he was the recipient of the Lord’s grace galore, because he was quite conscious of its great impact on him.
