நெடியான் அருள் சூடும் படியான் சடகோபன்  
நொடி ஆயிரத்துஇப்பத்து அடியார்க்கு அருள்பேறே (2)

neṭiyāṉ aruḷ cūṭum paṭiyāṉ [caṭakōpaṉ](/definition/catakopan#vaishnavism "show caṭakōpaṉ definitions")  
noṭi āyirattuippattu aṭiyārkku aruḷpēṟē (2)

**English translation of verse 10.5.11:**

These songs ten, out of the thousand of Caṭakōpaṉ,  
Who basks in the grand sun-shine  
Of the grace galore of the Lord Supreme,  
Will put the chanters on a par with him.

**Notes:**

\(i\) The [Āḻvār](/definition/aḻvar#vaishnavism "show Āḻvār definitions") ends up this decad by stating that the chanters of these ten songs will be blest, like him, with the Lord’s spontaneous grace, in super-abundance.

\(ii\) [Rāmāyaṇa](/definition/ramayana#vaishnavism "show Rāmāyaṇa definitions"), the great Ithihāsa, took [birth](/definition/birth#history "show birth definitions") in the grace of the four-headed [Brahmā](/definition/brahma#vaishnavism "show Brahmā definitions") who is anything but steady, while ‘[Viṣṇu](/definition/vishnu#vaishnavism "show Viṣṇu definitions") [Purāṇa](/definition/purana#vaishnavism "show Purāṇa definitions")’, the ‘Purāṇa-[Rātna](/definition/ratna#history "show Rātna definitions") is the outcome of the benedictive grace of ‘Puḷasthya [[Pulastya](/definition/pulastya#vaishnavism "show Pulastya definitions")] one of the four disciples of [Śiva](/definition/shiva#vaishnavism "show Śiva definitions") of tāmasik temperament and habits. On the other hand, [Tiruvāymoḻi](/definition/tiruvaymoli#vaishnavism "show Tiruvāymoḻi definitions") flowed from the loving grace of Lord [Mahā Viṣṇu](/definition/mahavishnu#vaishnavism "show Mahā Viṣṇu definitions"), the [Puruṣottama](/definition/purushottama#vaishnavism "show Puruṣottama definitions") of unalloyed [purity](/definition/purity#history "show purity definitions"). Herein lies the overwhelming superiority of Tiruvāymoḻi over Rāmāyaṇa, the epic of top-ranking excellence and Viṣṇupurāṇa which occupies the [pride](/definition/pride#history "show pride definitions") of place among the [Purāṇas](/definition/purana#vaishnavism "show Purāṇas definitions").

\(iii\) The Āḻvār could himself declare that he was the recipient of the Lord’s grace galore, because he was quite conscious of its great impact on him.
