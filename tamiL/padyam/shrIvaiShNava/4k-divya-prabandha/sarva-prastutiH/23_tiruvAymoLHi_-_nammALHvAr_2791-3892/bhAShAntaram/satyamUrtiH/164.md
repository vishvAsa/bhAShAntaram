**Tamil text and transliteration:**

ஊனில் வாழ் உயிரே நல்லை போ உன்னைப் பெற்று,  
வான் உளார் பெருமான் மதுசூதன் என் அம்மான்,  
தானும் யானும் எல்லாம் தன்னுள்ளே கலந்தொழிந்தோம்,  
தேனும் பாலும் நெய்யும் கன்னலும் அமுதும் ஒத்தே.

ūṉil vāḻ uyirē nallai pō uṉṉaip peṟṟu,  
vāṉ uḷār perumāṉ matucūtaṉ eṉ ammāṉ,  
tāṉum yāṉum ellām taṉṉuḷḷē kalantoḻintōm,  
tēṉum pālum neyyum kaṉṉalum amutum ottē.

**English translation of verse 2.3.1:**

Oh, ye mind, dwelling in the fleshy body,  
You are indeed good; because of you, It (this vassal)  
Could with Matucūtaṉ, my Lord, mingle, chief of Celestials  
And into Him dissolve like honey, milk, nectar and candy.

**Notes**

\(i\) In this decad, where the Āḻvār gives vent to his joy of communion with the Lord, the one he was pining for, praise is first bestowed on his forward mind which had overtaken him in its flight to God, seeking the bliss of union with Him. This is like a prince, restored back to his lost kingdom by some one, thanking that person first. The word ‘Uyir’ (soul) in the original text, by implication, refers to the mind, the principal adjunct, stirring up one’s thoughts either way.

\(ii\) The last line refers to the blend of all that is delicious and it can either be an admixture of all these delicacies or the mixture of like things only, (i.e.) honey with honey, milk with milk, nectar with nectar and so on.
