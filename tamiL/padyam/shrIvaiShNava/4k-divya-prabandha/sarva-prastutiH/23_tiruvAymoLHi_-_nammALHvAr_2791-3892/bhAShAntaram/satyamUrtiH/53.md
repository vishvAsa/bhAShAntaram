**Tamil text and transliteration:**

நாடாத மலர் நாடி நாள்தோறும் நாரணன் தன்  
வாடாத மலர் அடிக்கீழ் வைக்கவே வகுக்கின்று  
வீடாடி வீற்றிருத்தல் வினை அற்றது என் செய்வதோ?  
ஊடாடு பனி வாடாய்! உரைத்து ஈராய் எனது உடலே.

nāṭāta malar nāṭi nāḷtōṟum nāraṇaṉ taṉ  
vāṭāta malar aṭikkīḻ vaikkavē vakukkiṉṟu  
vīṭāṭi vīṟṟiruttal viṉai aṟṟatu eṉ ceyvatō?  
ūṭāṭu paṉi vāṭāy! uraittu īrāy eṉatu uṭalē.

**English translation of verse 1.4.9:**

You biting blast, ever on the move, enquire of Nāraṇaṉ, my Lord,  
Why (my limbs) for diurnal service at His floral feet ordained,  
Are this felicity denied and in melancholy steeped;  
If from Him, no favourable reply you obtain.  
Better (come and) split my body into twain.

**Notes**

\(i\) The chill blast, inflicting severe pain on Parāṅkuśa Nāyakī, like unto the king’s executioners torturing the subjects found guilty of high treason, is addressed by her as follows:

> “You see me deep down in dejection, due to long separation from my > Lord and it is my grievous misfortune that, in such a state, I abstain > from the stipulated daily service, such as > gathering > choice flowers and placing them reverently at the ever-fresh lotus > feet of the Lord, etc. You had better go and ask Him how this has come > to pass. If, however, He feels disinclined to take service from me, I > beg of you, taking your feet in my hands, to finish me off altogether > and thus put an end to this insipid and futile existence”.

\(ii\) The wind is the chief sustainer of life and appropriately symbolises the Ācārya (Preceptor).
