### FOREWORD

It has been long my desire to get an English translation in simple language of the holy Tirukkural, the teachings of which, to Tamilians, are an eternal inspiration and guide. More than 25 years back, I had invoked the aid and assistance of a great Tamil Pandit with whose collaboration I felt I would be in a position to bring out such a translation but, owing to his untimely demise, I had to give up the project. The happy thought struck me a few years back that, if my esteemed friend, Professor V. R. Ramachandra Dikshitar, could under take this task, it would be the consummation of my hope and desire. Professor Ramachandra Dikshitar readily agreed to my request that he might undertake to translate the holy Tirukkural. I could not have entrusted the work to a more distinguished scholar of Tamil literature or a better writer of simple and elegant English. Mr. Dikshitar's contribution in research, particularly of Tamil literature, is well known and needs no emphasis.

Mr. Dikshitar has presented to the public two volumes of the Tirukkural, one containing the text in Tamil with the English translation and the other, the text in Roman transliteration with the same English translation. I hope and trust that these volumes will have a wide circulation both in India and outside and that it will be possible, by donations and subsidy, to issue these volumes at a comparatively small cost. There is a great deal of patriotism in South India for Tamil language and a legitimate pride exhibited in the eternal verities that are enshrined in this holy scripture. This patriotism and pride will have to manifest itself by providing facilities for spreading these great divine truths to as wide a populace as possible, thereby extending that knowledge to races and peoples whose mother tongue is not Tamil. Tamil is one of the most ancient of classics and yet, while other classical literature has been translated into many of the modern languages, Tamil classics have been retained as the sole proud possession of Tamil scholars and have rarely been translated into other languages, Indian or foreign.  
Now that Mr. Dikshitar has completed his task, it behoves all of us who are enthusiastic about the Tamil language and more, about its literature, to do our best to make it available to peoples in foreign countries. I should like to express my very sincere thanks to Mr. Dikshitar for acceding to my request and bringing out these publications.

PREFATORY NOTE

This is the first time that the Adyar Library has included a Tamil text in its Series. The name of Prof. V. R. Ramachandra Dikshitar, the editor and translator of the Tirukkural now published, is already well-known as a great Tamil scholar by his book on The Studies in Tamil Literature and History. He is the well known Translator of that difficult Tamil classic the Silappadikaram. A smaller book of his, The Origin and spread of the Tamils, has already been published in this Series as No. 58 in 1947. It is a matter of gratification to the Library to be able to publish one of the most important Tamil Classics with an English translation by such a great scholar in the Library Series.

There may be many students who would be able to read and to study this text if it could be made available in a script with which they are familiar. And the Roman script is now fairly well spread over in the whole world; that is why the text has been given in the Roman script, with the English translation. But we cannot ignore the big population that knows the Tamil script, and the text in the Roman script may not be known to them to the same extent, if at all they know it. So there is given a parallel volume of the text in Tamil script with the same English translation as No. 68.

The Tirukkural is in three parts, dealing with the three "Aims" in life, namely, Dharma, Artha and Kama, so well-known in Hindu thought. We hear more now-a-days about the Varnasramadharma, as the foundation of Hindu life. But the real basis of Hindu life is the Trivarga, the three-fold objects of life, dealt with in this text. Perhaps the expression Puruşarthacatuştaya, (the four-fold objects of life) is more popular, with Moksa or final release as the fourth. But the truth is that according to the true Hindu view the objects of life are only three, and the fourth comes as a natural sequence. The three objects of life are not mutually exclusive; it is only a question of importance according to the different tendencies of the individuals.

The text and the translation are given one against the other on opposite pages, so that one can very easily make use of the translation while reading the text. The text has been edited before, and a few commentaries too are known. There have been also English translations prior to this. But the value of this new translation will be clear to anyone who reads the book. The text in Roman transliteration is now appearing for the first time. To the scholarship of Prof. Dikshitar is added the fame of the Vasanta Press for neat printing; and such a wealth is now offered at a very moderate price by the Adyar Library which has always sacrificed profit in the interest of service.

PREFACE

MORE than four years ago Sir A. Ramaswami Mudaliar, now Dewan of Mysore, suggested that I might undertake a translation of the Tirukkural as also its transliteration. The present book is the outcome of his suggestion. To serve the needs of a wider public, it is now published in two volumes, one containing the text in Roman transliteration and the other in Tamil script, and both containing English translation. The Tirukkural of Tiruvalluvar is the pride of South India. What the Bhagavad Gita is to the Sanskritist, the Tirukkural is to the lover of Tamil. In this book Tiruvalluvar treats of Muppal, or Trivarga (Dharma, Artha, and Kama). He has divided his book into three parts, the first dealing with Aram, the second with Porul, and the last with Kāma. This Tamil classic deals in extenso with the moral values of life which foster neighbourliness and love among all men and women to whatever race or community they may belong. It is now nearly twenty years since I published my Studies in Tamil Literature and History, where I have assigned the first or second century B. C. as the date of its composition. I find no reason to change that view.

In this endeavour I have largely followed the text and consulted the translation of the Tirukkural published by Sri A. Ranganatha Mudaliar, Triplicane. Mr. R. S. Desikan of the Presidency College and the Rev. W. B. Harris of the Methodist Mission looked into the manuscript of the work and offered me valuable suggestions for which my thanks are due to them. I must also acknowledge the immense help I received from Dr. M. Varadarajan, Senior Lecturer in Tamil, University of Madras, in going through the proofs. I am indebted to the authorities of the Adyar Library, Adyar especially to Captain G. Srinivasa Murti for undertaking this publication and to Dr. C. Kunhan Raja for his co-operation. I further record my thanks to the Syndicate of the Madras University for permitting me to bring out this publication.
