Division I. Virtue

००१
Praise of God
Translators
Notes

Notes:
१. "Bagavan". Scholars differ in their opinion as to what this word stands for. Most traditional and modern scholars, based on the title of the chapter "In praise of God", render the word to mean "Creator God". However Jaina scholars claim that the word "आदि भगवन्" [Ādi bagavan] is a clear reference to the name of the first Jina Thirthankara "ādeenath" or rashabha (Chakravarti, १९५१; Subramanyam, १९८७). It is interesting to note that Valluvar who has used very few words of Sanskrit origin in his whole work, opted for the twin word "आदि भगवन्" here. Moreover, since the simile "ऎऴुत्तॆल्लाम्" is plural, the emphasis "उलगु" should also be taken in plural. The "world" could thus means the "people of the world" (उलगत्तार्क्कु).
३. An alternate 'mystical' translation, but not implied in the original: "The Supreme dwells within the lotus of the heart. Those who reach His Splendid Feet dwell endearingly within unearthly realms" - (Satguru Subramuniyaswami). Other translators who adopted this interpretation Parithiyār and Kālingar (two of the five known ancient commentators of Tirukkural) include (G. Vanmikanathan), (K. Krishnaswamy & Vijaya Ramkumar) and (C. Rajagopalachari).
५. Twin deeds [of dark illusion] are fruits of both good and evil deeds.
६. This cannot be a reference to God, for God is beyond the senses and only mortals will be required to control the five senses. Almost all translators, however, have taken this as a reference to God. Some translators have attempted to get over this difficulty by employing non-committal renderings like this one: "He who has controlled the five senses and is established in the path of righteousness will lead a life of fulfillment" - (K. Krishnaswamy & Vijaya Ramkumar). It is worth noting that the word 'Jina' literally means "conqueror or victorious", i.e. the conqueror of five senses. This couplet could actually be a reference to a Jaina Tirthankara. Buddha also conquered the five senses, but neither Gautama nor the preceding Buddhas were called Adi Bagavan.
८. The word "अऱवाऴि" can be taken to mean, either "sea of virtue" or "wheel of the virtue". Similarly, the word "पिऱ" could either mean "birth" or "other". Depending on the combination of these meanings chosen, the couplet can also be translated in the following ways: (i) "Only those who reach the feet of the lord, the ocean of virtue, can cross those other oceans." - * (Norman Cutler). The other two oceans could be oceans of Wealth and Pleasure. (ii) "Only by clinging to the feet of the Lord of the wheel of virtue, that one can swim the ocean of this life" * - (G. Siromoney, S. Govindaraju & M. Chandrasekaran).
९. This couplet could refer to one of the five Parméstins, the Siddhās (liberated souls) of Jainism, because they only are designated with ८ guñas (qualities) (Malaiya, १९९८). The other four Arhats, Āchāryās, Upādhyāyās and Sādhus (Ashta Pahuda VI:१०४) are identified as Jinas with १२, ३६, २५ and २७ guñas respectively (Malaiya, १९९८). What are the eight qualities or guñas of Siddhās? Ananta jnāna, Ananta darshana, Ananta labdhi, Ananta sukha, Akshaya sthiti, Being vitāraga, Being arupa and Aguruladhutaa. Ancient commentator Parithiyar lists these eight qualities (अनन्द ज्ञानम्, अनन्द वीरियम्, कोत्तिरमिन्मै, अनन्द तरिसनम्, अनन्द कुणम्, अऴिया इयल्बु, नाममिन्मै, अवाविन्मै) as qualities of Lord Shiva!

Glory of rain
Translators
Notes

Notes:
२०. The word "ऒऴुक्कु" could be taken to mean either "conduct/virtue" or "flow/discharge/water". Thus, an alternate, but equally valid translation is: "If life cannot be sustained without water, virtue too depends on rain" - (S.M. Diaz). Using the other meaning, the couplet could also be translated as: "Life cannot exist without water, nor can flowing water without rain" – (N.V.K. Ashraf).

Greatness of ascetics
Translators
Notes

Notes:
२१. Compare with couplet २८ for similarity.
२३. "Both" here refer to the paths of 'householder' and 'ascetic'.
२४. The word "तोट्टि" here mean a "hook", implying the prod or ankush employed by mahouts to restrain elephants.
२५. S.M. Diaz (२०००), citing Manakkudavar's commentary, says it only refers to the insecurity of Indra had whenever a sage effectively controls his five senses and reached the heights of penance, lest he should ultimately endanger his own position - and so Valluvar used him as the witness to the ascetic's prowess.

Domestic life
Translators
Notes

Notes:
४१. The three orders possibly refer to these stages: Student, Elders and Renunciates
४९. There are two different renderings of this couplet. The word "अह्दुम्" is taken to mean "especially or that too" and also as "the other one also". The other one is obviously a reference to monastic or ascetic life. (Satguru Subramuniyaswami), ( Shuddhananda Bharatiar), (G.U. Pope) and (W.H. Drew and J. Lazarus) have followed the latter interpretation. (P.S. Sundaram), (K. Kannan), (K. Krishnaswamy & Vijaya Ramkumar), (J. Narayanaswamy), (V.V.S. Aiyar), (K. Krishnaswamy & Vijaya Ramkumar) and (K.R. Srinivasa Iyengar) have translated the couplet the other way. (Satguru Subramuniyaswami) has translated as: "Domestic life is called virtue, but the other one is also good if lived beyond blame". *

Notes:
५९. An alternate translation: "Where there is no reputation at home, there is no chance for proud leonine gaits outside" - (N.V.K. Ashraf). (J.

Notes:
७१. Compare with १२५: "The axe of love can break open the door of chastity secured by the bolt of modesty." * - (W.H. Drew and J. Lazarus), (J. Narayanaswamy).
७६. Usual translation is: "The naïve say that love aids virtue, but it safeguards against vice as well. – (K.R. Srinivasa Iyengar) [the same way by ( Shuddhananda Bharatiar), (P.S. Sundaram), (V.V.S. Aiyar), (K. Krishnaswamy & Vijaya Ramkumar)]. But there is no evidence in the original to support such an interpretation. Kalingar and Manakkudavar interpret the couplet as (T.K. Chidambaranatha Mudaliar). Interestingly (C. Rajagopalachari), (J. Narayanaswamy) and (K. Kannan) take the word "मऱम्" as "valour/soldier".

८८. By way of interpretation, this translation by (Satguru Subramuniyaswami) would help: "Those who never sacrifice to care for guests will later lament: We hoarded wealth, estranged ourselves, now none will care for us"
९०. Aniccham is a flower known for its fragility. Valluvar uses this flower in four places in Kural. The remaining couplets are in the third book "Love". [see ११११, १११५, ११२०]

Notes: 
१८१. It is Valluvar's style to emphasize on a particular quality by exalting it over other virtues. In २९७ he says: "If one speaks the truth and only truth, he need not seek other virtues" [(S.M. Diaz)]. In १५० he says: "You may trespass the bounds of other virtues, but not the bounds of another's wife" [(N.V.K. Ashraf)]

Notes:
३३८. Most translators render the word "कुडम्बै" as "egg-shell" [(P.S. Sundaram), (J. Narayanaswamy), ( Shuddhananda Bharatiar), (V.V.S. Aiyar), (W.H. Drew and J. Lazarus), (K. Krishnaswamy & Vijaya Ramkumar), (Satguru Subramuniyaswami), (K.R. Srinivasa Iyengar)], while (K. Kannan) and (G.U. Pope) take it as "nest". (V. Ramasamy) discusses the drawback in translating the word as "egg-shell" at length and says this meaning came to be associated with the word only after Parimelazhagar's time [Ramasamy, २००१]. Mamakkudavar and Kalingar, whose commentaries appeared before Parimelazhagar, mention that the meaning of "कुडम्बै" is nest. (V. Ramasamy) adds that no fledging flies when it comes out of the egg-shell and only to an intact nest could be compared to the human body, which remains intact even after the soul has left. Pertinent to bring here a reference to the same from the Semitic world: "Our soul has escaped as a bird out of the snare of the trapper" [Psalm, १२४:७].

Fate

Notes:
३७६. Compare with ६०९ under Avoiding Sloth. "Inherent flaws that are natural can be overcome by getting rid of indolence" – (N.V.K. Ashraf)
३७७. The word "वगुत्तान्" [Disposer] here is invariably taken to mean God. Most translators have obviously followed Parimelalagar's interpretation of the word "वगुत्तान्" as "तॆय्वम्". Chakravarti [१९५३] translates the word as "destiny". Relevant here is the translation of a similar passage from Naladiyar – a Jaina classic beyond doubt. "Though fortune forsake him and fate frown on him॥॥॥" Translator S. Anavaratavinayakam Pillai here has chosen to render the word "तॆय्वम्" as "fate". 
३७८. Valluvar says in couplet १०५०: “The poverty stricken has a chance to renounce, lest he hang around for salt and gruel”. * ((K. Kannan)). Here in couplet ३७८ he cites fate as the reason why the destitute have not renounced in spite of their poverty.
३८०. The same Valluvar says under “Manliness” in couplet ६२०: “Those who never get tired of striving undauntedly shall leave even Fate behind”. (( Shuddhananda Bharatiar), (P.S. Sundaram))

Notes:
४११. It is Valluvar's style to use the same idea to emphasize an important point. Here he emphasizes the wealth of hearing, at other places on the wealth of grace and learning. i.e. २४१. The wealth of wealth is the wealth of grace. Material wealth, even the mean possess. * - ( Shuddhananda Bharatiar), (P.S. Sundaram). ४००. The wealth that never declines is learning. All others are not riches - (P.S. Sundaram), (W.H. Drew and J. Lazarus).

Notes:
४३३. It is simply because, as Valluvar says in couplet ९६५, “Even a hill-like eminence can be brought low by deeds as small as a speck.” Also compare with couplets १०४ & १२८२ for the use of same similes “Millet” and “Palm tree”. “To the discerning even millet of aid is as big as a palm tree.” and “Where love is as large as a palm tree, even millet of sulk is misplaced”.

Even worthy schemes can fail when there is dearth in apportionment of tasks - (N.V.K. Ashraf)
Even good works go wrong if they don't match the recipient's nature - (K.R. Srinivasa Iyengar)
Even a good scheme goes awry when contributions don't come equally from all - (P.S. Sundaram), (N.V.K. Ashraf)

Translators
Notes

Notes:
५१०. If this verse is taken out of this context of "Testing and choosing", and placed under "Realization" [Chapter ३६: मॆय्युणर्दल्], the words "तेरान्" could mean 'muddled', “तॆळिन्दान्" could mean "Clarified/realized" and "ऐयुऱवुम्" could be taken to mean 'doubts'. The couplet then could well mean "The clarity claimed by a muddled-head and the doubts of a Realized, both cause endless trouble". The idea is that the realized souls should have no doubts and the unrealized cannot claim to be free of doubts.

५४५. Relationship between King and Rain has been emphasized by Valluvar in at least three places in Kural. Very similar ideas are conveyed in two couplets of the next chapter on “Misrule”. In ५५७, Valluvar says “How fares the earth without rain? So fares life under a ruthless king” and in ५५९ he says “If a king acts contrary to justice, monsoons fail and clouds shed no rain”.

Notes

Notes:
५५५. The couplet is sometimes shown ending with a question mark. The phrase is "कण्णीरण्ड्रे" and not "कण्णीरण्ड्रो". A good abridgment of the verse is given by (K. Krishnaswamy & Vijaya Ramkumar): "The tears resulting from suffering caused by the king will be the cause of his undoing"
५५७. Relationship between King and Rain has been emphasized by Valluvar in at least three places in Kural. In the very next verse ५५९ Valluvar says “If a king acts contrary to justice, monsoons fail and clouds shed no rain”. Only in the previous chapter on "Just Government" had he stated that "The king who rules according to the law never lacks rain and corn".
५६०. "अऱुदॊऴिलोर्" here has been taken to mean priests. "Brahmins are they who perform the six duties" says Tirumandiram [२२४]. While commenting on this mantra, translator B. Natarajan mentions that the six duties of a Brahmin are: To learn, to instruct, to give alms, to receive gifts, to perform sacrifice and to persuade other to perform sacrifices.

Notes:
६१४. Valluvar has used this simile of “sword in eunuch’s hand” at least thrice in the Kural. In ७२६ he asks “What use is a sword to cowards and books to those who fear assembly?” * ((P.S. Sundaram), (N.V.K. Ashraf)). And in ७२७, he says “As a sword to a eunuch before his foes, is the learning to one who fears assembly.” * ((G.U. Pope), (V.V.S. Aiyar))
६१७. (J. Narayanaswamy) provides an interesting translation, though not close to the original: "Where sloth resides total darkness prevails; where industry thrives, brightness radiates like lotus". The meaning of the couplet is best summed by (K. Krishnaswamy & Vijaya Ramkumar): "Misfortune will befall the indolent, while the goddess of wealth will attend the hardworking".
६१९. The word "तॆय्वम्" has also been translated sometimes as "fate" as in the case of "वगुत्तान्" in couplet ३७७. Relevant here is the translation of a similar passage from Naladiyar – a Jaina classic beyond doubt. "Though fortune forsake him and fate frown on him॥॥॥" Translator S. Anavaratavinayakam Pillai here has chosen to render the word "तॆय्वम्" as "fate".

Folly
Translators
Notes

Notes:
८३२. The interpretation of this couplet could vary depending on how the words in the second line are combined and read. One way is to split as: "कै अल्लदन्गण् सॆयल्". The other way is: "कैअल्ल तन्गण् सॆयल्." The translation given above is based on the second method of word combination. If we are to follow the first, an equally valid translation is "The folly of all follies is to enjoy doing what one is forbidden to do" – (Satguru Subramuniyaswami).
८४०. The word "पळ्ळि" here is usually taken by almost all translators as "bed". If we are to translate "कऴाक् काल् पळ्ळियुळ् वैत्तट्राल्" as "placing a dirty foot on a clean bed" – as it is usually done – then the phrase employed by Valluvar should have been "पळ्ळिमेल्" and not "पळ्ळियुळ्" as is the case here. The monasteries of the Jains and Buddhist monks were called "पळ्ळि" in the ancient Tamil country [Varadarajan, १९८८]. Following the near total disappearance of Buddhism and Jainism from Southern India, this word has now been used to denote the places of worship of Muslims and Christians. Hindu temples were always called by the names कोयिल्, आलयम्, अम्बलम् and never by the word पळ्ळि.

Other interesting translation is: "Fame will escape him who lets escape an easy victory over a fool" – (P.S. Sundaram).

Valluvar could be referring to this custom. Though two of the five traditional commentators of Tirukkural, namely Manakkudavar and Pariperumal, interpret this way [… पिणत्तै कूलिक्कु तऴुवियदु पोलुम्…॥], they do not refer to this as a practice amongst Nambudris.

However Kālingar, one of the five traditional commentators of Kural interpret the phrase “तूण्डिल् पॊन्” as “bait of gold”. On the contrary, the phrase has been invariably taken to mean “metal hook” with the word “पॊन्” once actually being used as a reference to any “metal”. The type of metal implied has to be inferred from the context [Sethu Pillai, १९७४].

९६८. A difficult verse to translate. The word “ऊन्” has been taken by different translators as “life”, “skin”, “body” and the word “मरुन्दो” to mean “nectar” or “medicine”. (V.V.S. Aiyar) provides an interesting but daring translation: “Is the skin forsooth immortality that men desire to save it at the cost of honour?” Another interesting translation, but not close to original: “Does life saved at the cost of honour, put off death for ever?” - (P.S. Sundaram)
९६९. The exact meaning of the word “कवरिमा” has not been established for this context. Since Valluvar is referring to the advantage of a wooly coat for surviving cold climates in high altitudes and polar regions, the word has been translated as “yak” here, as many translators do.

९८९: A difficult couplet to translate. Most translations follow Parimelazhagar’s view of taking ‘आऴि’ as sea shore and ‘ऊऴि पॆयरिनुम्’ as ‘even if a whelming sea breaks its bounds”. (P.S. Sundaram), therefore, translates this verse as “Seas may whelm, but men of character will stand like the shore”. However, the word ‘ऊऴि’ in general refers to ‘fate’ or ‘fortune’ and the word ‘आऴि’ to either ‘sea’ or ‘depth’. I have used these direct meanings to translate this couplet. Kalingar takes this interpretation. From Parimelazhagar’s standpoint, Sundaram’s translation may be improved like this: “Fortunes like seas may whelm, but men of character will remain unperturbed like the shore”.

१११५. aniccham – a flower known for its delicate nature. The idea here is that a woman’s waist is so delicate that it can’t even bear the weight of a delicate flower like aniccham if it is worn without removing its stalk.
१११७. This couplet may look simple but has been translated differently. The word “अऱुवाय्” has been usually taken to mean “variable, changing or inconstant” [(P.S. Sundaram), ( Shuddhananda Bharatiar)] and thereby interpreted by many as “waning and waxing moon” [(J. Narayanaswamy), (K. Kannan), (G.U. Pope), (M.S. Poornalingam Pillai)]. However, the very next word “निऱैन्द” [which means “filled with”] clearly implies that this word means the ‘spots or craters’ on the moon [“अऱु” can mean “break, crack, split” and “वाय्” “mouth”]. Though the couplets in Kural are usually discrete and independent of each other, there are occasions – especially in division “LOVE” – where the succeeding ones appear in sequence [chapter १३२ is a fine example]. Here it appears that the preceding couplet १११६ compares the lady’s face to the moon, with even the stars being unable to differentiate the two. This couplet takes the love’s face a step further and attempts to differentiate the two. Perhaps this is what is implied here: “Even the shining moon has spots of craters, but none on my love’s face”. Commentator Manakkudavar’s gives a fitting explanation. He says: “इवळ् मुगत्तु मऱुविल्लै यादलान्, अदु मदियोडु ऒव्वादु ऎण्ड्रु कूऱियदु”.

११४६. In ancient India, a lunar eclipse was considered the outcome of a serpent swallowing the moon. An alternate translation would be: “An eclipse is much noised however brief. So my one day's meeting with my love” - (P.S. Sundaram). We see this belief being mentioned in other texts. For instance by Chanakya in Rajaniti-Sastra: “Brave men do not become sad when they beget trouble. Does not the moon which enters the dragon’s mouth come out again?” Tirumoolar uses this belief to good effect to depict upsurge of Kundalini: “The Kundalini serpent consumes kalas of Moon, the Fire consumes kalas of Sun……” [Tirumandiram ८७१].

१२६२. Can be translated differently based on how the word "ऎन्" is being interpreted, whether as "what" or "mine". The phrase "मऱप्पिन् ऎन्" could therefore mean either "What if I forget" or "If I forget, my" and thus giving different meanings. (K.R. Srinivasa Iyengar), ( Shuddhananda Bharatiar), (V.V.S. Aiyar), (S.M. Diaz) and (K. Krishnaswamy & Vijaya Ramkumar) have preferred the first one, while (P.S. Sundaram), (K. Kannan), (J. Narayanaswamy), (M.S. Poornalingam Pillai), (G.U. Pope) and (W.H. Drew and J. Lazarus) have opted for the second interpretation. The first one has been preferred here. If the second rendering is chosen, then the couplet would be taken to mean: "My bright jewel, if I forget him now, bracelets will slide off my shoulders, losing its beauty" *- (M.S. Poornalingam Pillai), (J. Narayanaswamy). On the contrary, bracelets should actually slip and shoulders lose their beauty only when the lady keeps remembering her lover, not when she forgets!
१२६३. An alternate good translation but not close to original: "With his mind set on conquests he left, while I live here with my eyes set on his return" - (K. Krishnaswamy & Vijaya Ramkumar). Compare this with १२३०: "Longing for him who left longing for wealth, the evenings have their toll on my undying soul" - (N.V.K. Ashraf)
१२६४. The phrase "कूडिय कामम् पिरिन्दार्" has been taken to mean differently. As [i] "One who embraced and parted" by (M.S. Poornalingam Pillai), (S.M. Diaz), (V.V.S. Aiyar) and [ii] "reunion when my love returns" by ( Shuddhananda Bharatiar), (P.S. Sundaram). Both views seem to be correct, but (K. Krishnaswamy & Vijaya Ramkumar) and (W.H. Drew and J. Lazarus) take somewhat a middle path "the lover returning with enhanced love" by taking the word "कूडिय" as enhanced. But the context of the buoyant heart going higher and higher at the thought of the lover’s return imply that she is thinking about the reunion of love.
