Notes:
1. "Bagavan". Scholars differ in their opinion as to what this word stands for. Most traditional and modern scholars, based on the title of the chapter "In praise of God", render the word to mean "Creator God". However Jaina scholars claim that the word "ஆதி பகவன்" [Ādi bagavan] is a clear reference to the name of the first Jina Thirthankara "ādeenath" or rashabha (Chakravarti, 1951; Subramanyam, 1987). It is interesting to note that Valluvar who has used very few words of Sanskrit origin in his whole work, opted for the twin word "ஆதி பகவன்" here. .Moreover, since the simile "எழுத்தெல்லாம்" is plural, the emphasis "உலகு" should also be taken in plural. The "world" could thus means the "people of the world" (உலகத்தார்க்கு).
3. An alternate 'mystical' translation, but not implied in the original: "The Supreme dwells within the lotus of the heart. Those who reach His Splendid Feet dwell endearingly within unearthly realms" - SS.  Other translators who adopted this interpretation Parithiyār and Kālingar (two of the five known ancient commentators of Tirukkural) include GV, KV and CR.
5. Twin deeds [of dark illusion] are fruits of both good and evil deeds.
6. This cannot be a reference to God, for God is beyond the senses and only mortals will be required to control the five senses. Almost all translators, however, have taken this as a reference to God. Some translators have attempted to get over this difficulty by employing non-committal renderings like this one: "He who has controlled the five senses and is established in the path of righteousness will lead a life of fulfillment" - KV.  It is worth noting that the word 'Jina' literally means "conqueror or victorious", i.e. the conqueror of five senses. This couplet could actually be a reference to a Jaina Tirthankara. Buddha also conquered the five senses, but neither Gautama nor the preceding Buddhas were called Adi Bagavan.
8. The word "அறவாழி" can be taken to mean, either "sea of virtue" or "wheel of the virtue". Similarly, the word "பிற" could either mean "birth" or "other".  Depending on the combination of these meanings chosen, the couplet can also be translated in the following ways: (i) "Only those who reach the feet of the lord, the ocean of virtue, can cross those other oceans." - * NC. The other two oceans could be oceans of Wealth and Pleasure. (ii) "Only by clinging to the feet of the Lord of the wheel of virtue, that one can swim the ocean of this life" * - SG.
9. This couplet could refer to one of the five Parméstins, the Siddhās (liberated souls) of Jainism, because they only are designated with 8 guñas (qualities) (Malaiya, 1998). The other four Arhats, Āchāryās, Upādhyāyās and Sādhus (Ashta Pahuda VI:104) are identified as Jinas with 12, 36, 25 and 27 guñas respectively (Malaiya, 1998). What are the eight qualities or guñas of Siddhās? Ananta jnāna, Ananta darshana, Ananta labdhi, Ananta sukha, Akshaya sthiti, Being vitāraga, Being arupa and Aguruladhutaa. Ancient commentator Parithiyar lists these eight qualities (அனந்த ஞானம், அனந்த வீரியம், கோத்திரமின்மை, அனந்த தரிசனம், அனந்த குணம், அழியா இயல்பு, நாமமின்மை, அவாவின்மை) as qualities of Lord Shiva!

Glory of rain
Translators
Notes
0011
Rain is deemed a nectar of life
As its unfailing fall sustains the world. *
SS

0012
Rain is not only a consumable for the consumer
But also begets other consumables.
KK

0013
This vast world, with expanse of seas,
Will still suffer with famine if clouds deceive rain.
NV

0014
If that bounty called rain decrease,
Ploughing by ploughmen would also cease.
NV

0015
Rain holds the power of ruin.
Rain also lifts up those it has ruined.
NC

0016
If clouds stop dropping raindrops,
Even blades of grass will stop rising. *
PS, NV

0017
Even the vast sea will lose its richness,
If clouds cease and fail to bestow.
NV, JN

0018
If the heavens dry up, the very gods
Will lack festival and worship.
PS

0019
Both charity and penance would cease in this vast world,
Should heavens fail to deliver.
NV

0020
If the world cannot exist without water,
Neither can water exist without rain. *
PS, SS
Yes

Notes:
20. The word "ஒழுக்கு" could be taken to mean either "conduct/virtue" or "flow/discharge/water". Thus, an alternate, but equally valid translation is: "If life cannot be sustained without water, virtue too depends on rain" - DZ. Using the other meaning, the couplet could also be translated as: "Life cannot exist without water, nor can flowing water without rain" – NV. 

003	
Greatness of ascetics
Translators
Notes
0021
Scriptures ought to exalt with firmness
The greatness of disciplined ascetics. *
SS
Yes
0022
To recount an ascetic's greatness
Is to count the world's dead. *
PS

0023
The world shines on the greatness of those who,
Knowing both, choose renunciation. *
PS
Yes
0024
The restraint of senses five by the ankush of firmness
Is the seed for the bliss of heaven.
NV
Yes
0025
Even the celestial king Indra will vouch the strength
Of one who rules his senses five. *
KK, PS
Yes
0026
Great people take on difficult tasks;
Small people avoid them.
NC

0027
This world is his who knows for what these five are:
Taste, sight, touch, sound and smell. *
PS

0028
The scriptures of the world proclaim
The potent utterance of the great.
PS

0029
The wrath of those who have scaled the heights of character
Can't be endured even for a moment. *
KK, JN

0030
Ascetics are called men of virtue
For they assume the role of mercy for all that live.
NV


Notes:
21. Compare with couplet 28 for similarity.
23. "Both" here refer to the paths of 'householder' and 'ascetic'.
24. The word "தோட்டி" here mean a "hook", implying the prod or ankush employed by mahouts to restrain elephants.
25. S.M. Diaz (2000), citing Manakkudavar's commentary, says it only refers to the insecurity of Indra had whenever a sage effectively controls his five senses and reached the heights of penance, lest he should ultimately endanger his own position - and so Valluvar used him as the witness to the ascetic's prowess.

Emphasizing virtue	
Translators
Notes
0031
What gain greater than virtue can a living man obtain,
Which yields fame and fortune?
GU, KK

0032
There is no greater gain than virtue.
No surer path to ruin than its neglect.
NC

0033
The right thing to do is to be righteous
At all places and all times. *
KK

0034
A blemishless mind is the basis of all virtue.
Everything else is empty show.
DZ

0035
Envy, greed, wrath and harsh words:
These four avoided is virtue.
PS

0036
Defer not virtue but practice now.
At the dying hour she will be your undying friend. *
DL

0037
Inquiring about virtues' benefits? See that between
The rider and bearer of a palanquin. *
SS, MS
Yes
0038
The good you do without wasting a day
Is the stone that blocks the way to rebirth. *
PS

0039
Virtue alone brings happiness;
All else is naught, and without praise. *
PS

0040
Virtue is that which should be done.
And vice is that which should be shun.  
GU, KS


Notes:
37. VS's translation would explain this better: "Ask me not, What will it profit a man if he is righteous? Look at the bearer of the palanquin and him that rideth on it."

Domestic life
Translators
Notes
0041
A householder is a steadfast friend
To the other three orders in their virtuous paths.
PS
Yes
0042
The householder supports the needs of
Renunciates, ancestors and the poor.
SS

0043
A householder's main duty is to serve these five:
God, guests, kindred, ancestors and himself. *
SS

0044
His life and lineage will never end
who shuns blame and shares his food.
NV, PS

0045
Family life actuated by love and virtue,
Endows it with character and happiness
DZ

0046
What gains are there in other paths
When one leads the virtuous path of householder?
NV

0047
Foremost among those who strive for release,
Are the householders leading a righteous life. *
SS

0048
A virtuous householder endures
More than the penance of the penance doer.  *
DZ, DL

0049
Domestic life is proclaimed virtuous
And it is praiseworthy if free from blame. *
KV
Yes
0050
He who lives his life in this world as he should,
Ranks with the gods in the heaven.
CR


Notes:
41. The three orders possibly refer to these stages: Student, Elders and Renunciates
49. There are two different renderings of this couplet. The word "அஃதும்" is taken to mean "especially or that too" and also as "the other one also". The other one is obviously a reference to monastic or ascetic life. SS, SB, GU and DL have followed the latter interpretation. PS, KK, KV, JN, VS, KV and SI have translated the couplet the other way. SS has translated as:  "Domestic life is called virtue, but the other one is also good if lived beyond blame". *

Good life partner

What use is physical restraint to a woman
When her moral restraint is the best?

The woman who gains her husband's love
Gains great glory in the heaven. *
PS, DZ

0059
He whose wife is not praiseworthy
Cannot walk with leonine gait before his critics.
KV, NV
Yes
0060
A good wife is called boon to a house;
Besides that, good children its jewels. *
PS


Notes:
59. An alternate translation: "Where there is no reputation at home, there is no chance for proud leonine gaits outside" - NV. JN provides us an interesting translation: "The mind is without fear and the head is held high" when you are joined by a praiseworthy partner life. 

007
Begetting children
Translators
Notes
0061
Of all blessings we know,
Nothing worth than begetting intelligent children.
SS, PS

No harm will befall in all seven births
If one begets blameless children.

0063
Children are called one's fortune;
And their fortune the result of their own deeds. *

0064
Sweeter than nectar is the porridge messed up
By the tiny hands of one’s children. *
GV

0065
To be touched by children is a delight to the body,

Say those who never heard their children lisp.

The son's duty to his father is to make world ask,
"By what austerities did he merit such a son! *
SS

Possession of love
Translators
Notes
0071
Can love be latched and hidden?
A trickling tear will proclaim it loud.
PS
Yes
0072
The unloving belong only to themselves,
But the loving belong to others to their very bones.
SS

0073
They say it is to know the union with love
That the soul takes union with the body.
SS

0074
Love begets desire: and that begets
The priceless excellence called friendship. *
DL

0075
The excellence of worldly happiness, they say,
Is attained by those leading a loving life. *

So does virtue scorch a loveless being.

Of what avail is body frame - the external,
To those who lack love - the internal?
NV

0080
The throb of life is love. Without it,
Humans are bodies of bones clad with skin. *
JN, PS


Notes:
71. Compare with 125: "The axe of love can break open the door of chastity secured by the bolt of modesty." * - DL, JN.
76. Usual translation is: "The naïve say that love aids virtue, but it safeguards against vice as well. – SI [the same way by SB, PS, VS, KV].  But there is no evidence in the original to support such an interpretation. Kalingar and Manakkudavar interpret the couplet as TK. Interestingly CR, JN and KK take the word "மறம்" as "valour/soldier". 

009
Hospitality

0081
It is to exercise the benevolence of hospitality
That people earn a living and establish homes.

Flower aniccham withers when merely smelt.
An unwelcome look is enough to wither a guest. *
SS
Yes

Notes:
81. Compare with 212. "All the wealth earned by toils is meant to serve those who deserve" * - SB
87. Compare with 105. "Not according to the aid but its receiver is its recompense determined" - PS
88. By way of interpretation, this translation by SS would help: "Those who never sacrifice to care for guests will later lament: We hoarded wealth, estranged ourselves, now none will care for us"
90. Aniccham is a flower known for its fragility. Valluvar uses this flower in four places in Kural. The remaining couplets are in the third book "Love". [see 1111, 1115, 1120]

Pleasant speech

Both here and hereafter.
PS

0099
How can anyone speak harsh words,
Having seen what kind words do?
NV
Yes
0100
To use harsh words, when sweet ones are at hand,
Is to prefer raw fruit to ripe.
PS


Notes:
93. Compare with 786. “A smiling face alone makes no friendship, but the heart should also smile with the face” * - VR
99. Compare with 318 for style. "Why does one hurt others knowing what it is to be hurt?" - PS

Notes:
104. Compare with couplets 433 & 1282 for the use of same similes “Millet” and “Palm tree”. “To those ashamed of wrong doings, even millet of fault is as big as a palm-tree” and “Where love is as large as a palm tree, even millet of sulk is misplaced”.
105. Compare with 87. "The gains of hospitality cannot be reckoned. Their worth depends on the guest" - PS

Forbearance

Notes:
338. Most translators render the word "குடம்பை" as "egg-shell" [PS, JN, SB, VS, DL, KV, SS, SI], while KK and GU take it as "nest". VR discusses the drawback in translating the word as "egg-shell" at length and says this meaning came to be associated with the word only after Parimelazhagar's time [Ramasamy, 2001]. Mamakkudavar and Kalingar, whose commentaries appeared before Parimelazhagar, mention that the meaning of "குடம்பை" is nest. VR adds that no fledging flies when it comes out of the egg-shell and only to an intact nest could be compared to the human body, which remains intact even after the soul has left. Pertinent to bring here a reference to the same from the Semitic world: "Our soul has escaped as a bird out of the snare of the trapper" [Psalm, 124:7].

Notes:
376. Compare with 609 under Avoiding Sloth. "Inherent flaws that are natural can be overcome by getting rid of indolence" – NV
377. The word "வகுத்தான்" [Disposer] here is invariably taken to mean God. Most translators have obviously followed Parimelalagar's interpretation of the word "வகுத்தான்" as "தெய்வம்".  Chakravarti [1953] translates the word as "destiny". Relevant here is the translation of a similar passage from Naladiyar – a Jaina classic beyond doubt. "Though fortune forsake him and fate frown on him......" Translator S. Anavaratavinayakam Pillai here has chosen to render the word "தெய்வம்" as "fate". 
378. Valluvar says in couplet 1050: “The poverty stricken has a chance to renounce, lest he hang around for salt and gruel”. * (KK). Here in couplet 378 he cites fate as the reason why the destitute have not renounced in spite of their poverty.
380. The same Valluvar says under “Manliness” in couplet 620: “Those who never get tired of striving undauntedly shall leave even Fate behind”. (SB, PS)

Notes:
411. It is Valluvar's style to use the same idea to emphasize an important point. Here he emphasizes the wealth of hearing, at other places on the wealth of grace and learning. i.e. 241.

Notes:
510. If this verse is taken out of this context of "Testing and choosing", and placed under "Realization" [Chapter 36: மெய்யுணர்தல்], the words "தேரான்" could mean 'muddled', “தெளிந்தான்" could mean "Clarified/realized" and "ஐயுறவும்" could be taken to mean 'doubts'. The couplet then could well mean "The clarity claimed by a muddled-head and the doubts of a Realized, both cause endless trouble". The idea is that the realized souls should have no doubts and the unrealized cannot claim to be free of doubts.

555. The couplet is sometimes shown ending with a question mark. The phrase is "கண்ணீரன்றே" and not "கண்ணீரன்றோ". A good abridgment of the verse is given by KV: "The tears resulting from suffering caused by the king will be the cause of his undoing"
557. Relationship between King and Rain has been emphasized by Valluvar in at least three places in Kural. In the very next verse 559 Valluvar says “If a king acts contrary to justice, monsoons fail and clouds shed no rain”. Only in the previous chapter on "Just Government" had he stated that "The king who rules according to the law never lacks rain and corn".
560. "அறுதொழிலோர்" here has been taken to mean priests. "Brahmins are they who perform the six duties" says Tirumandiram [224]. While commenting on this mantra, translator B. Natarajan mentions that the six duties of a Brahmin are: To learn, to instruct, to give alms, to receive gifts, to perform sacrifice and to persuade other to perform sacrifices.

Notes:
614. Valluvar has used this simile of “sword in eunuch’s hand” at least thrice in the Kural. In 726 he asks “What use is a sword to cowards and books to those who fear assembly?” * (PS, NV). And in 727, he says “As a sword to a eunuch before his foes, is the learning to one who fears assembly.” * (GU, VS)
617. JN provides an interesting translation, though not close to the original: "Where sloth resides total darkness prevails; where industry thrives, brightness radiates like lotus". The meaning of the couplet is best summed by KV: "Misfortune will befall the indolent, while the goddess of wealth will attend the hardworking".
619. The word "தெய்வம்" has also been translated sometimes as "fate" as in the case of "வகுத்தான்" in couplet 377. Relevant here is the translation of a similar passage from Naladiyar – a Jaina classic beyond doubt. "Though fortune forsake him and fate frown on him......" Translator S. Anavaratavinayakam Pillai here has chosen to render the word "தெய்வம்" as "fate".

714. "Where ignorance is bliss, it is folly to be wise" – Gray.
716. This is yet another couplet in Tirukkural where the interpretation of a single word could change the simile [like couplet 20].  Here the word "ஆற்றின்" could mean either "path" or "river". The phrase could be read as "ஆற்றில்" or "ஆற்றின்" நிலை தளர்ந்து அற்றே. Parimelazhagar interprets this as "spiritual path", Kalingar, Manakkudavar and Pariperumal as "righteous path" and Parithiyar alone as "river".

Notes:
832. The interpretation of this couplet could vary depending on how the words in the second line are combined and read. One way is to split as: "கை அல்லதன்கண் செயல்".  The other way is: "கைஅல்ல தன்கண் செயல்." The translation given above is based on the second method of word combination. If we are to follow the first, an equally valid translation is "The folly of all follies is to enjoy doing what one is forbidden to do" – SS.
840. The word "பள்ளி" here is usually taken by almost all translators as "bed". If we are to translate "கழாக் கால் பள்ளியுள் வைத்தற்றால்" as "placing a dirty foot on a clean bed" – as it is usually done – then the phrase employed by Valluvar should have been "பள்ளிமேல்" and not "பள்ளியுள்" as is the case here. The monasteries of the Jains and Buddhist monks were called "பள்ளி" in the ancient Tamil country [Varadarajan, 1988]. Following the near total disappearance of Buddhism and Jainism from Southern India, this word has now been used to denote the places of worship of Muslims and Christians. Hindu temples were always called by the names கோயில், ஆலயம், அம்பலம் and never by the word பள்ளி.

Other interesting translation is: "Fame will escape him who lets escape an easy victory over a fool" – PS.

Valluvar could be referring to this custom. Though two of the five traditional commentators of Tirukkural, namely Manakkudavar and Pariperumal, interpret this way [… பிணத்தை கூலிக்கு தழுவியது போலும்…..], they do not refer to this as a practice amongst Nambudris.

931. Padmanabhan [2003] refers to the practice amongst fishermen of Kanyakumari [Muttom area] to use glittering golden lace as bait for fishing. However, none of the 20 translations from different sources compared in this exercise has interpreted this way. However Kālingar, one of the five traditional commentators of Kural interpret the phrase “தூண்டில் பொன்” as “bait of gold”. On the contrary, the phrase has been invariably taken to mean “metal hook” with the word “பொன்” once actually being used as a reference to any “metal”. The type of metal implied has to be inferred from the context [Sethu Pillai, 1974].

962. Compare with 1017. “Men of honour give up life for honour’s sake, but never abandon honour to save life” * - CR
965. 965. That’s why in Kural 433, the author says: “To those ashamed of wrong doings, even millet of fault is as big as a palm-tree” * - VR, PS
968. A difficult verse to translate. The word “ஊன்” has been taken by different translators as “life”, “skin”, “body” and the word “மருந்தோ” to mean “nectar” or “medicine”. VS provides an interesting but daring translation: “Is the skin forsooth immortality that men desire to save it at the cost of honour?” Another interesting translation, but not close to original: “Does life saved at the cost of honour, put off death for ever?” - PS
969. The exact meaning of the word “கவரிமா” has not been established for this context. Since Valluvar is referring to the advantage of a wooly coat for surviving cold climates in high altitudes and polar regions, the word has been translated as “yak” here, as many translators do.

987. Compare with 314. Punish an evil-doer by shaming him with a good deed.* - PS
989: A difficult couplet to translate. Most translations follow Parimelazhagar’s view of taking ‘ஆழி’ as sea shore and ‘ஊழி பெயரினும்’ as ‘even if a whelming sea breaks its bounds”. PS, therefore, translates this verse as “Seas may whelm, but men of character will stand like the shore”.  However, the word ‘ஊழி’ in general refers to ‘fate’ or ‘fortune’ and the word ‘ஆழி’ to either ‘sea’ or ‘depth’. I have used these direct meanings to translate this couplet. Kalingar takes this interpretation. From Parimelazhagar’s standpoint, Sundaram’s translation may be improved like this: “Fortunes like seas may whelm, but men of character will remain unperturbed like the shore”.

Notes:
1115. aniccham – a flower known for its delicate nature. The idea here is that a woman’s waist is so delicate that it can’t even bear the weight of a delicate flower like aniccham if it is worn without removing its stalk.
1117. This couplet may look simple but has been translated differently. The word “அறுவாய்” has been usually taken to mean “variable, changing or inconstant” [PS, SB] and thereby interpreted by many as “waning and waxing moon” [JN, KK, GU, MS]. However, the very next word “நிறைந்த” [which means “filled with”] clearly implies that this word means the ‘spots or craters’ on the moon [“அறு” can mean “break, crack, split” and “வாய்” “mouth”].  Though the couplets in Kural are usually discrete and independent of each other, there are occasions – especially in division “LOVE” – where the succeeding ones appear in sequence [chapter 132 is a fine example]. Here it appears that the preceding couplet 1116 compares the lady’s face to the moon, with even the stars being unable to differentiate the two. This couplet takes the love’s face a step further and attempts to differentiate the two. Perhaps this is what is implied here: “Even the shining moon has spots of craters, but none on my love’s face”.  Commentator Manakkudavar’s gives a fitting explanation. He says: “இவள் முகத்து மறுவில்லை யாதலான், அது மதியோடு ஒவ்வாது என்று கூறியது”.
1120. Simply, it means: “Even flower petals and down feathers are prickly to my damsel’s feet”. Flower aniccham is known for its softness and the fruit nerunji for its thorns.

Have nothing but the madal for strength.
 GU, PS

Away with shame! Soul and body can bear no more,
And will mount the madal.
 PS

1133
Modesty and manliness once I owned,
But now only the madal ridden by the lustful. *

 DL, GU

The village gossip manures my love,

This village gossip is what we desire,
For it serves the desire of my lover. *
NV, PS


Notes:
1146. In ancient India, a lunar eclipse was considered the outcome of a serpent swallowing the moon. An alternate translation would be: “An eclipse is much noised however brief. So my one day's meeting with my love” - PS. We see this belief being mentioned in other texts. For instance by Chanakya in Rajaniti-Sastra: “Brave men do not become sad when they beget trouble. Does not the moon which enters the dragon’s mouth come out again?” Tirumoolar uses this belief to good effect to depict upsurge of Kundalini: “The Kundalini serpent consumes kalas of Moon, the Fire consumes kalas of Sun……” [Tirumandiram 871].

It is futile to hope for reunion. *

Notes:
1151. Another way of putting it: “What use is telling me of your departure? Inform that to those who survive to see your return”- NV]
1157. A convention in ancient Tamil poetry was that separation from her lover makes a woman’s hands thin and her bangles loose [Sundaram, 1989]. The idea is repeated in couplet 1277.

Notes:
1171. An interesting alternate translation, but not close to the original: “My eyes only showed him and filled me with passion. Why now filled with tears?” * - KV

Notes:
1196. The word “kaavadi” [காவடி, appearing as “கா” in Kural] refers to the shoulder pole used to carry heavy articles on either side.
1200. There are differing renderings of this couplet. The word “உறார்க்கு” is sometimes taken to mean “strangers or people” and the word “செறாய்” to mean “not to be angry or furious”.

VS, PS


Notes:
1262. Can be translated differently based on how the word "என்" is being interpreted, whether as "what" or "mine". The phrase "மறப்பின் என்" could therefore mean either "What if I forget" or "If I forget, my" and thus giving different meanings. SI, SB, VS, DZ and KV have preferred the first one, while PS, KK, JN, MS, GU and DL have opted for the second interpretation. The first one has been preferred here. If the second rendering is chosen, then the couplet would be taken to mean: "My bright jewel, if I forget him now, bracelets will slide off my shoulders, losing its beauty" *- MS, JN. On the contrary, bracelets should actually slip and shoulders lose their beauty only when the lady keeps remembering her lover, not when she forgets!
1263. An alternate good translation but not close to original: "With his mind set on conquests he left, while I live here with my eyes set on his return" - KV. Compare this with 1230: "Longing for him who left longing for wealth, the evenings have their toll on my undying soul" - NV
1264. The phrase "கூடிய காமம் பிரிந்தார்" has been taken to mean differently. As [i] "One who embraced and parted" by MS, DZ, VS and [ii] "reunion when my love returns" by SB, PS. Both views seem to be correct, but KV and DL take somewhat a middle path "the lover returning with enhanced love" by taking the word "கூடிய" as enhanced. But the context of the buoyant heart going higher and higher at the thought of the lover’s return imply that she is thinking about the reunion of love.
