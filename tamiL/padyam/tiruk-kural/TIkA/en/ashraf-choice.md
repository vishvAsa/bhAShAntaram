००१०
The ocean of births can be crossed by none other than
Those who reach the feet of the Lord. *
(P.S. Sundaram)


Notes:
१. "Bagavan". Scholars differ in their opinion as to what this word stands for. Most traditional and modern scholars, based on the title of the chapter "In praise of God", render the word to mean "Creator God". However Jaina scholars claim that the word "आदि भगवन्" [Ādi bagavan] is a clear reference to the name of the first Jina Thirthankara "ādeenath" or rashabha (Chakravarti, १९५१; Subramanyam, १९८७). It is interesting to note that Valluvar who has used very few words of Sanskrit origin in his whole work, opted for the twin word "आदि भगवन्" here. Moreover, since the simile "ऎऴुत्तॆल्लाम्" is plural, the emphasis "उलगु" should also be taken in plural. The "world" could thus means the "people of the world" (उलगत्तार्क्कु).
३. An alternate 'mystical' translation, but not implied in the original: "The Supreme dwells within the lotus of the heart. Those who reach His Splendid Feet dwell endearingly within unearthly realms" - (Satguru Subramuniyaswami). Other translators who adopted this interpretation Parithiyār and Kālingar (two of the five known ancient commentators of Tirukkural) include (G. Vanmikanathan), KV and (C. Rajagopalachari).
५. Twin deeds [of dark illusion] are fruits of both good and evil deeds.
६. This cannot be a reference to God, for God is beyond the senses and only mortals will be required to control the five senses. Almost all translators, however, have taken this as a reference to God. Some translators have attempted to get over this difficulty by employing non-committal renderings like this one: "He who has controlled the five senses and is established in the path of righteousness will lead a life of fulfillment" - KV. It is worth noting that the word 'Jina' literally means "conqueror or victorious", i.e. the conqueror of five senses. This couplet could actually be a reference to a Jaina Tirthankara. Buddha also conquered the five senses, but neither Gautama nor the preceding Buddhas were called Adi Bagavan.
८. The word "अऱवाऴि" can be taken to mean, either "sea of virtue" or "wheel of the virtue". Similarly, the word "पिऱ" could either mean "birth" or "other". Depending on the combination of these meanings chosen, the couplet can also be translated in the following ways: (i) "Only those who reach the feet of the lord, the ocean of virtue, can cross those other oceans." - * (Norman Cutler). The other two oceans could be oceans of Wealth and Pleasure. (ii) "Only by clinging to the feet of the Lord of the wheel of virtue, that one can swim the ocean of this life" * - (G. Siromoney, S. Govindaraju & M. Chandrasekaran).
९. This couplet could refer to one of the five Parméstins, the Siddhās (liberated souls) of Jainism, because they only are designated with ८ guñas (qualities) (Malaiya, १९९८). The other four Arhats, Āchāryās, Upādhyāyās and Sādhus (Ashta Pahuda VI:१०४) are identified as Jinas with १२, ३६, २५ and २७ guñas respectively (Malaiya, १९९८). What are the eight qualities or guñas of Siddhās? Ananta jnāna, Ananta darshana, Ananta labdhi, Ananta sukha, Akshaya sthiti, Being vitāraga, Being arupa and Aguruladhutaa. Ancient commentator Parithiyar lists these eight qualities (अनन्द ज्ञानम्, अनन्द वीरियम्, कोत्तिरमिन्मै, अनन्द तरिसनम्, अनन्द कुणम्, अऴिया इयल्बु, नाममिन्मै, अवाविन्मै) as qualities of Lord Shiva!

Glory of rain
Translators
Notes
००११
Rain is deemed a nectar of life
As its unfailing fall sustains the world. *
(Satguru Subramuniyaswami)

००१२
Rain is not only a consumable for the consumer
But also begets other consumables.
(K. Kannan)

००१३
This vast world, with expanse of seas,
Will still suffer with famine if clouds deceive rain.
(N.V.K. Ashraf)

००१४
If that bounty called rain decrease,
Ploughing by ploughmen would also cease.
(N.V.K. Ashraf)

००१५
Rain holds the power of ruin.
Rain also lifts up those it has ruined.
(Norman Cutler)

००१६
If clouds stop dropping raindrops,
Even blades of grass will stop rising. *
(P.S. Sundaram), (N.V.K. Ashraf)

००१७
Even the vast sea will lose its richness,
If clouds cease and fail to bestow.
(N.V.K. Ashraf), (J. Narayanaswamy)

००१८
If the heavens dry up, the very gods
Will lack festival and worship.
(P.S. Sundaram)

००१९
Both charity and penance would cease in this vast world,
Should heavens fail to deliver.
(N.V.K. Ashraf)

००२०
If the world cannot exist without water,
Neither can water exist without rain. *
(P.S. Sundaram), (Satguru Subramuniyaswami)


Notes:
२०. The word "ऒऴुक्कु" could be taken to mean either "conduct/virtue" or "flow/discharge/water". Thus, an alternate, but equally valid translation is: "If life cannot be sustained without water, virtue too depends on rain" - (S.M. Diaz). Using the other meaning, the couplet could also be translated as: "Life cannot exist without water, nor can flowing water without rain" – (N.V.K. Ashraf). 

००३	
Greatness of ascetics
Translators
Notes
००२१
Scriptures ought to exalt with firmness
The greatness of disciplined ascetics. *
(Satguru Subramuniyaswami)

००२२
To recount an ascetic's greatness
Is to count the world's dead. *
(P.S. Sundaram)

००२३
The world shines on the greatness of those who,
Knowing both, choose renunciation. *
(P.S. Sundaram)

००२४
The restraint of senses five by the ankush of firmness
Is the seed for the bliss of heaven.
(N.V.K. Ashraf)

००२५
Even the celestial king Indra will vouch the strength
Of one who rules his senses five. *
(K. Kannan), (P.S. Sundaram)

००२६
Great people take on difficult tasks;
Small people avoid them.
(Norman Cutler)

००२७
This world is his who knows for what these five are:
Taste, sight, touch, sound and smell. *
(P.S. Sundaram)

००२८
The scriptures of the world proclaim
The potent utterance of the great.
(P.S. Sundaram)

००२९
The wrath of those who have scaled the heights of character
Can't be endured even for a moment. *
(K. Kannan), (J. Narayanaswamy)

००३०
Ascetics are called men of virtue
For they assume the role of mercy for all that live.
(N.V.K. Ashraf)


Notes:
२१. Compare with couplet २८ for similarity.
२३. "Both" here refer to the paths of 'householder' and 'ascetic'.
२४. The word "तोट्टि" here mean a "hook", implying the prod or ankush employed by mahouts to restrain elephants.
२५. S.M. Diaz (२०००), citing Manakkudavar's commentary, says it only refers to the insecurity of Indra had whenever a sage effectively controls his five senses and reached the heights of penance, lest he should ultimately endanger his own position - and so Valluvar used him as the witness to the ascetic's prowess.

Emphasizing virtue	
Translators
Notes
००३१
What gain greater than virtue can a living man obtain,
Which yields fame and fortune?

There is no greater gain than virtue.
No surer path to ruin than its neglect.
(Norman Cutler)

००३३
The right thing to do is to be righteous
At all places and all times. *
(K. Kannan)

००३५
Envy, greed, wrath and harsh words:
These four avoided is virtue.
(P.S. Sundaram)

००३६
Defer not virtue but practice now.
At the dying hour she will be your undying friend. *
(W.H. Drew and J. Lazarus)

००३७
Inquiring about virtues' benefits? See that between
The rider and bearer of a palanquin. *
(Satguru Subramuniyaswami), (M.S. Poornalingam Pillai)

००३८
The good you do without wasting a day
Is the stone that blocks the way to rebirth. *
(P.S. Sundaram)

००३९
Virtue alone brings happiness;
All else is naught, and without praise. *
(P.S. Sundaram)

००४०
Virtue is that which should be done.
And vice is that which should be shun.  
(G.U. Pope), (Kasthuri Sreenivasan)


Notes:
३७. (V.V.S. Aiyar)'s translation would explain this better: "Ask me not, What will it profit a man if he is righteous? Look at the bearer of the palanquin and him that rideth on it."

००५
Domestic life
Translators
Notes
००४१
A householder is a steadfast friend
To the other three orders in their virtuous paths.
(P.S. Sundaram)

००४२
The householder supports the needs of
Renunciates, ancestors and the poor.
(Satguru Subramuniyaswami)

००४३
A householder's main duty is to serve these five:
God, guests, kindred, ancestors and himself. *
(Satguru Subramuniyaswami)

००४४
His life and lineage will never end
who shuns blame and shares his food.
(N.V.K. Ashraf), (P.S. Sundaram)

००४५
Family life actuated by love and virtue,
Endows it with character and happiness
(S.M. Diaz)

००४६

When one leads the virtuous path of householder?
(N.V.K. Ashraf)

००४७
Foremost among those who strive for release,
Are the householders leading a righteous life. *

००४८
A virtuous householder endures
More than the penance of the penance doer. *
(S.M. Diaz), (W.H. Drew and J. Lazarus)

००४९
Domestic life is proclaimed virtuous
And it is praiseworthy if free from blame. *
KV

००५०
He who lives his life in this world as he should,
Ranks with the gods in the heaven.
(C. Rajagopalachari)


Notes:
४१. The three orders possibly refer to these stages: Student, Elders and Renunciates
४९. There are two different renderings of this couplet. The word "अह्दुम्" is taken to mean "especially or that too" and also as "the other one also". The other one is obviously a reference to monastic or ascetic life. (Satguru Subramuniyaswami), ( Shuddhananda Bharatiar), (G.U. Pope) and (W.H. Drew and J. Lazarus) have followed the latter interpretation. (P.S. Sundaram), (K. Kannan), KV, (J. Narayanaswamy), (V.V.S. Aiyar), KV and (K.R. Srinivasa Iyengar) have translated the couplet the other way. (Satguru Subramuniyaswami) has translated as: "Domestic life is called virtue, but the other one is also good if lived beyond blame". *

Good life partner

००५१
An ideal wife is a virtuous life partner
Living within her husband's means.

If the wife lacks household excellence,
All other excellence in life comes to nil.

००५४
What more grandeur does a woman need
Than possessing the strength of chastity?
(N.V.K. Ashraf)

००५५
Even rains fall at the command of the wife
Who upon rising worships not God, but her husband.

००५६
A tireless woman guards herself,
Cares for her spouse and upholds family name.

००५७
What use is physical restraint to a woman
When her moral restraint is the best?
(K. Kannan)

००५८
The woman who gains her husband's love
Gains great glory in the heaven. *
(P.S. Sundaram), (S.M. Diaz)

००५९

Cannot walk with leonine gait before his critics.
KV, (N.V.K. Ashraf)

००६०
A good wife is called boon to a house;
Besides that, good children its jewels. *
(P.S. Sundaram)


Notes:
५९. An alternate translation: "Where there is no reputation at home, there is no chance for proud leonine gaits outside" - (N.V.K. Ashraf). (J. Narayanaswamy) provides us an interesting translation: "The mind is without fear and the head is held high" when you are joined by a praiseworthy partner life.

Say those who never heard their children lisp.

As the blazing sun dries up a boneless worm,
So does virtue scorch a loveless being.

In a barren desert failing to shoot.

Of what avail is body frame - the external,
To those who lack love - the internal?
(N.V.K. Ashraf)

००८०
The throb of life is love. Without it,
Humans are bodies of bones clad with skin. *
(J. Narayanaswamy), (P.S. Sundaram)


Notes:
७१. Compare with १२५: "The axe of love can break open the door of chastity secured by the bolt of modesty." * - (W.H. Drew and J. Lazarus), (J. Narayanaswamy).
७६. Usual translation is: "The naïve say that love aids virtue, but it safeguards against vice as well. – (K.R. Srinivasa Iyengar) [the same way by ( Shuddhananda Bharatiar), (P.S. Sundaram), (V.V.S. Aiyar), KV]. But there is no evidence in the original to support such an interpretation. Kalingar and Manakkudavar interpret the couplet as (T.K. Chidambaranatha Mudaliar). Interestingly (C. Rajagopalachari), (J. Narayanaswamy) and (K. Kannan) take the word "मऱम्" as "valour/soldier". 

००९
Hospitality
Translators
Notes
००८१
It is to exercise the benevolence of hospitality
That people earn a living and establish homes.

००८२
With a guest outside, it is wrong to eat alone,
Even the nectar of immortality. *
(N.V.K. Ashraf), (Satguru Subramuniyaswami)

००८३
His life won’t suffer from want,
Who always cherishes his flowing guests.
MR, (N.V.K. Ashraf)

००८४
The goddess of fortune will dwell in the house of one
Who plays host with a smile. *
(N.V.K. Ashraf), (P.S. Sundaram)

००८५
Should his field be sown,
Who first feeds the guests and eats the rest?
( Shuddhananda Bharatiar)

००८६
Who hosts the passing guests and waits for hosting more
Will be hosted by the gods. *
(P.S. Sundaram)

००८७
The gains of hospitality cannot be reckoned.
Their worth depends on the guest.
(P.S. Sundaram)

००८८
"We toiled, stored and lost", lament those
Who never sacrificed for hospitality.
(N.V.K. Ashraf)

००८९
To have no guests is to want amidst plenty:
Such poverty belongs to fools.
(P.S. Sundaram)

००९०
Flower aniccham withers when merely smelt.
An unwelcome look is enough to wither a guest. *
(Satguru Subramuniyaswami)


Notes:
८१. Compare with २१२. "All the wealth earned by toils is meant to serve those who deserve" * - ( Shuddhananda Bharatiar)
८७. Compare with १०५. "Not according to the aid but its receiver is its recompense determined" - (P.S. Sundaram)
८८. By way of interpretation, this translation by (Satguru Subramuniyaswami) would help: "Those who never sacrifice to care for guests will later lament: We hoarded wealth, estranged ourselves, now none will care for us"
९०. Aniccham is a flower known for its fragility. Valluvar uses this flower in four places in Kural. The remaining couplets are in the third book "Love". [see ११११, १११५, ११२०]

Other things do not count.

Sweet words free of meanness yield joy,
Both here and hereafter.

Having seen what kind words do?

०१००
To use harsh words, when sweet ones are at hand,
Is to prefer raw fruit to ripe.
(P.S. Sundaram)


Notes:
९३. Compare with ७८६. “A smiling face alone makes no friendship, but the heart should also smile with the face” * - (V. Ramasamy)
९९. Compare with ३१८ for style. "Why does one hurt others knowing what it is to be hurt?" - (P.S. Sundaram)

If one recollects a past good turn.
(S.M. Diaz)

०११०
One may slain every goodness and yet escape,
But no escape for one who slain gratitude.
(Satguru Subramuniyaswami)


Notes:
१०४. Compare with couplets ४३३ & १२८२ for the use of same similes “Millet” and “Palm tree”. “To those ashamed of wrong doings, even millet of fault is as big as a palm-tree” and “Where love is as large as a palm tree, even millet of sulk is misplaced”.
१०५. Compare with ८७. "The gains of hospitality cannot be reckoned. Their worth depends on the guest" - (P.S. Sundaram)

३३८. Most translators render the word "कुडम्बै" as "egg-shell" [(P.S. Sundaram), (J. Narayanaswamy), ( Shuddhananda Bharatiar), (V.V.S. Aiyar), (W.H. Drew and J. Lazarus), KV, (Satguru Subramuniyaswami), (K.R. Srinivasa Iyengar)], while (K. Kannan) and (G.U. Pope) take it as "nest". (V. Ramasamy) discusses the drawback in translating the word as "egg-shell" at length and says this meaning came to be associated with the word only after Parimelazhagar's time [Ramasamy, २००१]. Mamakkudavar and Kalingar, whose commentaries appeared before Parimelazhagar, mention that the meaning of "कुडम्बै" is nest. (V. Ramasamy) adds that no fledging flies when it comes out of the egg-shell and only to an intact nest could be compared to the human body, which remains intact even after the soul has left. Pertinent to bring here a reference to the same from the Semitic world: "Our soul has escaped as a bird out of the snare of the trapper" [Psalm, १२४:७].

A man may have studied many subtle works,
But what survives is his innate wisdom.

०३८०
What is there mightier than fate? For it overtakes us
In spite of our plans to overcome it. *

Notes:
३७६. Compare with ६०९ under Avoiding Sloth. "Inherent flaws that are natural can be overcome by getting rid of indolence" – (N.V.K. Ashraf)
३७७. The word "वगुत्तान्" [Disposer] here is invariably taken to mean God. Most translators have obviously followed Parimelalagar's interpretation of the word "वगुत्तान्" as "तॆय्वम्". Chakravarti [१९५३] translates the word as "destiny". Relevant here is the translation of a similar passage from Naladiyar – a Jaina classic beyond doubt. "Though fortune forsake him and fate frown on him॥॥॥" Translator S. Anavaratavinayakam Pillai here has chosen to render the word "तॆय्वम्" as "fate". 
३७८. Valluvar says in couplet १०५०: “The poverty stricken has a chance to renounce, lest he hang around for salt and gruel”. * ((K. Kannan)). Here in couplet ३७८ he cites fate as the reason why the destitute have not renounced in spite of their poverty.
३८०. The same Valluvar says under “Manliness” in couplet ६२०: “Those who never get tired of striving undauntedly shall leave even Fate behind”. (( Shuddhananda Bharatiar), (P.S. Sundaram))

(K.R. Srinivasa Iyengar)



Notes:
५१०. If this verse is taken out of this context of "Testing and choosing", and placed under "Realization" [Chapter ३६: मॆय्युणर्दल्], the words "तेरान्" could mean 'muddled', “तॆळिन्दान्" could mean "Clarified/realized" and "ऐयुऱवुम्" could be taken to mean 'doubts'. The couplet then could well mean "The clarity claimed by a muddled-head and the doubts of a Realized, both cause endless trouble". The idea is that the realized souls should have no doubts and the unrealized cannot claim to be free of doubts.

Notes:
५५५. The couplet is sometimes shown ending with a question mark. The phrase is "कण्णीरण्ड्रे" and not "कण्णीरण्ड्रो". A good abridgment of the verse is given by KV: "The tears resulting from suffering caused by the king will be the cause of his undoing"
५५७. Relationship between King and Rain has been emphasized by Valluvar in at least three places in Kural. In the very next verse ५५९ Valluvar says “If a king acts contrary to justice, monsoons fail and clouds shed no rain”. Only in the previous chapter on "Just Government" had he stated that "The king who rules according to the law never lacks rain and corn".
५६०. "अऱुदॊऴिलोर्" here has been taken to mean priests. "Brahmins are they who perform the six duties" says Tirumandiram [२२४]. While commenting on this mantra, translator B. Natarajan mentions that the six duties of a Brahmin are: To learn, to instruct, to give alms, to receive gifts, to perform sacrifice and to persuade other to perform sacrifices.

६१४. Valluvar has used this simile of “sword in eunuch’s hand” at least thrice in the Kural. In ७२६ he asks “What use is a sword to cowards and books to those who fear assembly?” * ((P.S. Sundaram), (N.V.K. Ashraf)). And in ७२७, he says “As a sword to a eunuch before his foes, is the learning to one who fears assembly.” * ((G.U. Pope), (V.V.S. Aiyar))
६१७. (J. Narayanaswamy) provides an interesting translation, though not close to the original: "Where sloth resides total darkness prevails; where industry thrives, brightness radiates like lotus". The meaning of the couplet is best summed by KV: "Misfortune will befall the indolent, while the goddess of wealth will attend the hardworking".
६१९. The word "तॆय्वम्" has also been translated sometimes as "fate" as in the case of "वगुत्तान्" in couplet ३७७. Relevant here is the translation of a similar passage from Naladiyar – a Jaina classic beyond doubt. "Though fortune forsake him and fate frown on him॥॥॥" Translator S. Anavaratavinayakam Pillai here has chosen to render the word "तॆय्वम्" as "fate".
६२०. Compare with ३८० "What is there mightier than fate? For it overtakes us in spite of our plans to overcome it" * - (Satguru Subramuniyaswami), (N.V.K. Ashraf)

७१४. "Where ignorance is bliss, it is folly to be wise" – Gray.
७१६. This is yet another couplet in Tirukkural where the interpretation of a single word could change the simile [like couplet २०]. Here the word "आट्रिन्" could mean either "path" or "river". The phrase could be read as "आट्रिल्" or "आट्रिन्" निलै तळर्न्दु अट्रे. Parimelazhagar interprets this as "spiritual path", Kalingar, Manakkudavar and Pariperumal as "righteous path" and Parithiyar alone as "river".

Notes:
८३२. The interpretation of this couplet could vary depending on how the words in the second line are combined and read. One way is to split as: "कै अल्लदन्गण् सॆयल्". The other way is: "कैअल्ल तन्गण् सॆयल्." The translation given above is based on the second method of word combination. If we are to follow the first, an equally valid translation is "The folly of all follies is to enjoy doing what one is forbidden to do" – (Satguru Subramuniyaswami).
८४०. The word "पळ्ळि" here is usually taken by almost all translators as "bed". If we are to translate "कऴाक् काल् पळ्ळियुळ् वैत्तट्राल्" as "placing a dirty foot on a clean bed" – as it is usually done – then the phrase employed by Valluvar should have been "पळ्ळिमेल्" and not "पळ्ळियुळ्" as is the case here. The monasteries of the Jains and Buddhist monks were called "पळ्ळि" in the ancient Tamil country [Varadarajan, १९८८]. Following the near total disappearance of Buddhism and Jainism from Southern India, this word has now been used to denote the places of worship of Muslims and Christians. Hindu temples were always called by the names कोयिल्, आलयम्, अम्बलम् and never by the word पळ्ळि.

A couplet that has been translated differently by different authors: (Satguru Subramuniyaswami) puts it as: "Fame will escape the grasp of those who fail to grasp the wealth of fools who failed to learn". Manakkudavar, one of the great ancient commentators of Kural, takes these words "कल्लान्, वॆगुळुम्, सिऱुबॊरुळ्" to mean "ignorant, angry and deficient" as attributes of an enemy [Diaz, २०००]. Other interesting translation is: "Fame will escape him who lets escape an easy victory over a fool" – (P.S. Sundaram).

Why does he not note his own damage?

Notes:
९३०. Compare with ९९ and ३१८ for the typical style of Valluvar: “How can anyone speak harsh words, having seen what kind words do?” - (N.V.K. Ashraf) and “Why does one hurt others knowing what it is to be hurt?” - (P.S. Sundaram)

Don’t gamble even if you win for it draws you in
Like fishes drawn to shining baits.

Can gamblers gain anything good in life
Who gain one and lose a hundred? *

०९३३
To be lost all the time in the rolling dice
Is to lose your hoarded wealth to others.

There is nothing like gambling to bring
Poverty, sorrow and disgrace.

The board and the throw.

Those blindfolded by the dark ogress called dice
Will starve and suffer in distress. *

Riches, food, fame, learning and clothes.
(N.V.K. Ashraf)

०९४०
Like the attachment to life despite sufferings
Is the love for gambling despite loss. *
(K. Kannan)


Notes:
९३१. Padmanabhan [२००३] refers to the practice amongst fishermen of Kanyakumari [Muttom area] to use glittering golden lace as bait for fishing. However, none of the २० translations from different sources compared in this exercise has interpreted this way. However Kālingar, one of the five traditional commentators of Kural interpret the phrase “तूण्डिल् पॊन्” as “bait of gold”. On the contrary, the phrase has been invariably taken to mean “metal hook” with the word “पॊन्” once actually being used as a reference to any “metal”. The type of metal implied has to be inferred from the context [Sethu Pillai, १९७४].

९४०. (P.S. Sundaram) would say: "Life goes on in spite of loss and stakes in spite of loss!"

The noble, stripped of their honour, prefer death.
(N.V.K. Ashraf)

०९७०
The world will admire and worship the glory of men
Who prefer death to dishonour. *

Notes:
९६२. Compare with १०१७. “Men of honour give up life for honour’s sake, but never abandon honour to save life” * - (C. Rajagopalachari)
९६५. ९६५. That’s why in Kural ४३३, the author says: “To those ashamed of wrong doings, even millet of fault is as big as a palm-tree” * - (V. Ramasamy), (P.S. Sundaram)
९६८. A difficult verse to translate. The word “ऊन्” has been taken by different translators as “life”, “skin”, “body” and the word “मरुन्दो” to mean “nectar” or “medicine”. (V.V.S. Aiyar) provides an interesting but daring translation: “Is the skin forsooth immortality that men desire to save it at the cost of honour?” Another interesting translation, but not close to original: “Does life saved at the cost of honour, put off death for ever?” - (P.S. Sundaram)
९६९. The exact meaning of the word “कवरिमा” has not been established for this context. Since Valluvar is referring to the advantage of a wooly coat for surviving cold climates in high altitudes and polar regions, the word has been translated as “yak” here, as many translators do.

Goodness

All virtues are said to be natural to those
Who acquire character as a duty.

No other goodness than good character
Is deemed good by the noble.
(N.V.K. Ashraf)

०९८३
The pillars of excellence are five:
Love, modesty, altruism, compassion, truthfulness.
(P.S. Sundaram)

०९८४
The characteristic of penance is non-killing,
And that of goodness not speaking others’ faults.
(N.V.K. Ashraf)

०९८५
Humility is the strength of the strong and the weapon
The wise use to conquer their foes.
(Satguru Subramuniyaswami)

०९८६
The touchstone of goodness is to own
One's defeat even to inferiors.
(P.S. Sundaram)

०९८७
What good is that goodness if it does not return good
Even to those who cause evil? *

Poverty is no disgrace to one

०९९०
The earth will cease to bear its burden
If perfect men fall short of perfection.

Notes:
९८४. Compare with २६१: “The characteristic of penance lies in enduring hardships and harming no life” - (N.V.K. Ashraf)
९८७. Compare with ३१४. Punish an evil-doer by shaming him with a good deed.* - (P.S. Sundaram)
९८९: A difficult couplet to translate. Most translations follow Parimelazhagar’s view of taking ‘आऴि’ as sea shore and ‘ऊऴि पॆयरिनुम्’ as ‘even if a whelming sea breaks its bounds”. (P.S. Sundaram), therefore, translates this verse as “Seas may whelm, but men of character will stand like the shore”. However, the word ‘ऊऴि’ in general refers to ‘fate’ or ‘fortune’ and the word ‘आऴि’ to either ‘sea’ or ‘depth’. I have used these direct meanings to translate this couplet. Kalingar takes this interpretation. From Parimelazhagar’s standpoint, Sundaram’s translation may be improved like this: “Fortunes like seas may whelm, but men of character will remain unperturbed like the shore”.

Who blush for their and others’ blame. *

Men of honour give up life for honour’s sake,

१०५०. Explanation: The poor might as well renounce and follow the path of asceticism, instead of depending on others for survival. Valluvar says in couplet ३७८ that “fate” is the reason why the poverty stricken have failed to renounce.

The denied suppliant should not chafe.
His own want is proof enough. *

Notes:
१०६०. i.e. proof enough to gauge the miserable condition of the one who refused. (J. Narayanaswamy)’s translation will help understand the import of the verse explicitly: “Seekers should disdain anger; the givers with good intent may also be in dire straits”.

What use are the base in a crisis,
Save to rush and sell themselves?

११२०
Even aniccham flower and swan's down
Are as nerunji fruit to my maidens’ feet. *
(V.V.S. Aiyar)


Notes:
१११५. aniccham – a flower known for its delicate nature. The idea here is that a woman’s waist is so delicate that it can’t even bear the weight of a delicate flower like aniccham if it is worn without removing its stalk.
१११७. This couplet may look simple but has been translated differently. The word “अऱुवाय्” has been usually taken to mean “variable, changing or inconstant” [(P.S. Sundaram), ( Shuddhananda Bharatiar)] and thereby interpreted by many as “waning and waxing moon” [(J. Narayanaswamy), (K. Kannan), (G.U. Pope), (M.S. Poornalingam Pillai)]. However, the very next word “निऱैन्द” [which means “filled with”] clearly implies that this word means the ‘spots or craters’ on the moon [“अऱु” can mean “break, crack, split” and “वाय्” “mouth”]. Though the couplets in Kural are usually discrete and independent of each other, there are occasions – especially in division “LOVE” – where the succeeding ones appear in sequence [chapter १३२ is a fine example]. Here it appears that the preceding couplet १११६ compares the lady’s face to the moon, with even the stars being unable to differentiate the two. This couplet takes the love’s face a step further and attempts to differentiate the two. Perhaps this is what is implied here: “Even the shining moon has spots of craters, but none on my love’s face”. Commentator Manakkudavar’s gives a fitting explanation. He says: “इवळ् मुगत्तु मऱुविल्लै यादलान्, अदु मदियोडु ऒव्वादु ऎण्ड्रु कूऱियदु”.
११२०. Simply, it means: “Even flower petals and down feathers are prickly to my damsel’s feet”. Flower aniccham is known for its softness and the fruit nerunji for its thorns.

Notes:
११४६. In ancient India, a lunar eclipse was considered the outcome of a serpent swallowing the moon. An alternate translation would be: “An eclipse is much noised however brief. So my one day's meeting with my love” - (P.S. Sundaram). We see this belief being mentioned in other texts. For instance by Chanakya in Rajaniti-Sastra: “Brave men do not become sad when they beget trouble. Does not the moon which enters the dragon’s mouth come out again?” Tirumoolar uses this belief to good effect to depict upsurge of Kundalini: “The Kundalini serpent consumes kalas of Moon, the Fire consumes kalas of Sun……” [Tirumandiram ८७१].

Notes:
११५१. Another way of putting it: “What use is telling me of your departure? Inform that to those who survive to see your return”- (N.V.K. Ashraf)]
११५७. A convention in ancient Tamil poetry was that separation from her lover makes a woman’s hands thin and her bangles loose [Sundaram, १९८९]. The idea is repeated in couplet १२७७.

To one dead of a broken heart, what avails my return,
Meeting or even embrace?
(V.V.S. Aiyar), (P.S. Sundaram)


Notes:
१२६२. Can be translated differently based on how the word "ऎन्" is being interpreted, whether as "what" or "mine". The phrase "मऱप्पिन् ऎन्" could therefore mean either "What if I forget" or "If I forget, my" and thus giving different meanings. (K.R. Srinivasa Iyengar), ( Shuddhananda Bharatiar), (V.V.S. Aiyar), (S.M. Diaz) and KV have preferred the first one, while (P.S. Sundaram), (K. Kannan), (J. Narayanaswamy), (M.S. Poornalingam Pillai), (G.U. Pope) and (W.H. Drew and J. Lazarus) have opted for the second interpretation. The first one has been preferred here. If the second rendering is chosen, then the couplet would be taken to mean: "My bright jewel, if I forget him now, bracelets will slide off my shoulders, losing its beauty" *- (M.S. Poornalingam Pillai), (J. Narayanaswamy). On the contrary, bracelets should actually slip and shoulders lose their beauty only when the lady keeps remembering her lover, not when she forgets!
१२६३. An alternate good translation but not close to original: "With his mind set on conquests he left, while I live here with my eyes set on his return" - KV. Compare this with १२३०: "Longing for him who left longing for wealth, the evenings have their toll on my undying soul" - (N.V.K. Ashraf)
१२६४. The phrase "कूडिय कामम् पिरिन्दार्" has been taken to mean differently. As [i] "One who embraced and parted" by (M.S. Poornalingam Pillai), (S.M. Diaz), (V.V.S. Aiyar) and [ii] "reunion when my love returns" by ( Shuddhananda Bharatiar), (P.S. Sundaram). Both views seem to be correct, but KV and (W.H. Drew and J. Lazarus) take somewhat a middle path "the lover returning with enhanced love" by taking the word "कूडिय" as enhanced. But the context of the buoyant heart going higher and higher at the thought of the lover’s return imply that she is thinking about the reunion of love.
